Rapid changes in customer needs, emerging technologies, and new market opportunities demand quick and effective product design processes that can provide a competitive advantage. The focus on improving the effectiveness of the design process has led to renewed attention on studying and improving creativity training in engineering education. Since creative solutions contribute the most value to the design process, design educators are recognizing that students graduating engineering programs need to be trained for creativity prior to entering the workforce. \nWhile a large focus of creativity training in engineering education has been on helping students develop creative ideas, researchers have argued that the \u201cavailability of creative ideas is a necessary but insufficient condition for innovation\u201d. This is because creative ideas are often filtered out during the design process because of people\u2019s inadvertent bias against creativity. In other words, concept selection can now be seen as the \u201cgatekeeper of creativity.\u201d In addition, informal selection methods, often used in engineering industry, are subject to decision-making biases such as ownership bias and risk aversion. However, few studies have explored the impact of these factors on creative concept selection in engineering design education leaving it unclear exactly how these factors impact the design training of the next generation of design engineers. \nTherefore, the objective of this dissertation was to develop a theoretical understanding of the individual factors that impact creative concept selection processes in engineering design education. This was achieved through empirical studies with 427 engineering design students, spanning 3 research objectives: (1) an exploration of the decision-making process in informal student team concept selection practices, (2) a detailed investigation of the cognitive biases and personal attributes that influence team decision-making and creativity, and (3) identification of the underlying constructs that influence individual preferences for creative concepts and its influence on engineering student behavior. The results of this research contribute fundamental knowledge on the factors and elements that constitute preference for creativity in engineering student decision-making, allowing researchers to develop tools and methods that encourage creativity, improve innovation effectiveness, and increase the competitive advantage of the design process.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12612], "author_name_tesi": "Toh, Christine ", "last_name_ssi": "Toh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scarlett Rae Miller", "Scarlett Rae Miller", "Gul Kremer", "Timothy William Simpson", "Samuel Todd Hunter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scarlett Rae Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Scarlett Rae Miller, Committee Chair", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Samuel Todd Hunter, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Engineering Design", "Creativity", "Concept Selection", "Engineering Education", "Preferences for Creativity", "Design Decision-Making", "Decision-Making Biases", "Psychometrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Exploring Discourse and Knowledge Sharing in Online Affinity Spaces for Teachers", "id": "bz60cw251", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the ways in which teachers utilize and engage with online spaces as a type of informal learning and to examine the social interactions that take place therein.

It is presented as a case study using content and discourse analysis based upon the theoretical ideas of informal learning, specifically affinity spaces. The main research question guiding this study was: What types of discourse are shared in these online spaces for teachers?  The supporting questions guiding this study were: What types of questions do participants pose? What types of responses do participants provide? What patterns of knowledge sharing emerge through the questions and responses? and What are the social interactions in the forum?  Discussion postings were coded according to Arvaja\u2019s (2012) framework that distinguished types of discourse as elaboration, sharing, or others as resources for enhancing personal understanding.  Discussion participants engaged others by posting questions or soliciting advice that reflected their own professional and personal learning needs in the moment; furthermore, the participants relied on personal experience and examples to support and legitimize their responses.

Although hydrogen can be combusted as a fuel, it is considered an energy carrier for use in fuel cells wherein it is consumed (oxidized) without the production of greenhouse gases.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) formed a Center of Excellence for Chemical Hydrogen Storage, and this work stems from that project.  The DOE has identified boron hydrides as being the main compounds of interest as hydrogen storage materials.  The various boron hydrides are then oxidized to release their hydrogen, thereby forming a \u201cspent fuel\u201d in the form of a lower boron hydride or even a boron oxide.  The ultimate goal of this project is to take the oxidized boron hydrides as the spent fuel and hydrogenate them back to their original form so they can be used again as a fuel.  Thus this research is essentially a boron hydride recycling project.\n\nOne class of boron hydrides, called polyhedral boranes, became of interest to the DOE due to their ability to contain a sufficient amount of hydrogen and their physical and chemical safety attributes.  Unfortunately, the research performed here has shown that polyhedral boranes do not react in such a way as to allow enough hydrogen to be released, nor do they appear to undergo hydrogenation from the spent fuel form back to the original hydride.\n\nAfter the polyhedral boranes were investigated, the project goals remained the same but the hydrogen storage material was switched by the DOE to ammonia borane.  Ammonia borane was found to undergo an irreversible hydrogen release process, so a direct hydrogenation was not able to occur.  To achieve the hydrogenation of the spent ammonia borane fuel, an indirect hydrogenation reaction is possible by using compounds called organotin hydrides.  In this process, the organotin hydrides will hydrogenate the spent ammonia borane fuel at the cost of their own oxidation, which forms organotin halides.  To enable a closed-loop cycle, my task was then to be able to hydrogenate the organotin halides back to their hydride form.\n\nIn addition to this experimental work, a parallel project was carried out to develop a new model of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  The EIS technique is capable of probing complex chemical and electrochemical reactions, and this model was written into a computer code that allowed the input of experimental EIS data and the extraction of kinetic parameters based on a best-fit analysis of theoretical reaction schemes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2594],

extend the composite fermion model,\nthe key to our understanding of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE),\nbeyond its primary domain (media with quadratic dispersion relation, lowest Landau level).\n\nThe poor performance of the standard composite fermion wave functions in the 1/5 to\n4/5 filling factor range of the second Landau level of media with quadratic dispersion\nis caused by the significant residual interaction between composite fermions.\nA perturbative improvement to the composite fermion wave function describes the\nexact ground state very accurately for small systems in the disk geometry in this range.\nUsing the same approach in the spherical geometry the excitation gap is estimated at filling factor 7/3.\n\nThe FQHE at half-filled second Landau level (5/2 and 7/2) has been a long standing enigma.\nThe popular Pfaffian model of Moore and Read is reviewed and scrutinized. \nIn an exact diagonalization study on finite systems it is shown\nthat the Pfaffian model provides an inadequate description of the excitations,\nwhose non-Abelian braiding statistics has been exploited in several proposals for quantum computing.\nAn alternative understanding of the 5/2 FQHE within the composite fermion theory is presented.\nThe residual interaction between composite fermions is found to play a crucial role \nin establishing incompressibility at 5/2.\nThe low-energy spectrum and the activation gap are estimated with the help of a perturbative\nprocedure that incorporates inter-composite-fermion interactions.\nThis approach is amenable to systematic improvement, and produces ground as well as excited states.\nIt, however, does not relate to non-Abelian statistics in any obvious manner.\n\nGraphene, a single-layer hexagonal form of carbon, provides a two-dimensional electron system with\ntwo unusual properties: the low-energy electronic states have a linear\ndispersion, and the two sublattices of the hexagonal lattice introduce a valley degree of freedom.\nBoth have consequences for the FQHE, which remains to be observed.\n\nFor large Zeeman energy, the low-energy electronic states still have an SU(2) valley symmetry.\nPhenomena formerly discussed for the vanishing Zeeman energy limit in GaAs are predicted to occur here:\npurely interaction-induced integer plateaus, large pseudoskyrmions, fractional sequences, even/odd numerator effects,\ncomposite fermion pseudoskyrmions, and a pseudospin-singlet composite-fermion Fermi sea.\nAs a consequence of the linear dispersion of the low-energy carriers the |n|=1 Landau level is\npredicted to show more robust FQHE than the n=1 Landau level of GaAs.\n\nIf the Zeeman energy is much smaller than the interaction energy scale, the system is approximately SU(4) symmetric.\nNew FQHE states are predicted at fractions n/(2pn+/-1) with n>=3,\nwhich involve an essential interplay between the spin and valley degeneracies.\nConditions for the observation of these states are outlined, and the structure of these states and their excitations is described.\nZero-temperature phase transitions are predicted to occur between these states when the SU(4) symmetry is weakly broken

bilingual memory assume that concepts are similar across the bilingual's two languages. However, there are cases in which conceptual overlap may not be perfect across translation equivalents. The results of Experiment 1 show that translation production generally is slower and more error-prone the more ambiguous words are. Furthermore, ambiguity was shown to interact with conceptual salience (the degree to which a word refers to a perceptible object or \u2018concreteness\u2019, and the ease with which one can think of a context for a word or \u2018context availabilty\u2019) and cognate status (lexical overlap of translation equivalents). The effects of multiple meanings were reduced for cognates and enhanced for words high in conceptual salience, whereas the effects of multiple translations were relatively constant across word types. Furthermore, ambiguity was shown to influence performance on a within-language task, lexical decision, such that ambiguous words were responded to more quickly than unambiguous words. Conceptual salience also influenced lexical decision latencies such that words high in conceptual salience were responded to more quickly than words low in conceptual salience. Thus, ambiguity and conceptual salience do not interact in the within-language lexical decision task, and the two factors have direct and independent influences on word recognition. The results of the third experiment showed that alternate conceptual candidates become activated during the translation process, similar to results for within-language picture naming (Peterson & Savoy, 1998).

In the DMC approach, component damage is incorporated in the control law to reduce the damage rate for enhanced structural durability. The DES controller monitors the system performance and, based on the mission requirements (e.g., performance metrics and level of damage mitigation), switches among various lower-level controllers. The core idea is to design a framework where the DES controller at the upper-level, mimics human intelligence and makes appropriate decisions to satisfy mission requirements, enhance system performance and structural durability.

Investigation of the spatial and temporal variability of surfaces within dust source regions has the potential to elucidate the processes that control erodibility and to improve model predictions of dust emission. In this dissertation the variability in time and space of surface mineralogical composition, particle size distribution, and surface roughness is measured in a playa (the Black Rock Desert, NV, USA). Water is found to be critical to the development of playa surfaces. Analysis of samples from the Black Rock playa demonstrates that the playa is mainly composed of quartz (~30 wt%), clay (~45 wt%), plagioclase (~10 wt%), calcite (2-15 wt%), and halite (0-40 wt%). Composition varies between the center of the playa (more frequently inundated) and edge, with smaller particles, more clay, less plagioclase, and less calcite in the central areas. The surface roughness of the Black Rock playa is observed through time (2004-2010) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data. Surface roughness is relatively constant during the dry summer months, but changes significantly from year to year, suggesting that water and inundation have more control on playa surfaces than anthropogenic activity or saltation abrasion. Roughness is low in years with heavy precipitation, but late drying areas of the playa are rough. Small scale lab experiments on a playa analog surface demonstrate that cycles of wetting/drying increase roughness, particularly for surfaces with added CaCO3; a surface with added CaCO3 produced aggregates of a size appropriate for saltation (< 100 microns) through wetting/drying cycles, while a surface with added NaCl remained relatively smooth. These observations suggest a conceptual framework for the development of surfaces in a playa: inundation smooths the playa surface while cycles of wetting/drying roughen it.

Geography and history offer unique perspectives on the notion of context, a context defined in this research as geo-historical context, or GHC. GHC creates a contextual setting based on the interconnectedness of phenomena, events, and place across multiple spatial and temporal scales that allow situations to be reasoned with, often through visual representations such as maps. Although GHC is important for understanding the circumstances of situations, three main challenges exist to modeling and producing GHC. First, no formal approach for modeling or reasoning with GHC exists. Second, in an application domain such as crisis management, GHC for a given situation does not exist in an isolated state. Rather, GHC is tightly coupled to and shaped by the tasks and goals of collaborative actors that need to contextualize a situation from a geo-historical perspective. Third, information that can potentially contextualize situations from geographical and historical perspectives is vast and heterogeneous. \nThese challenges are explored in this research. Specifically, the research presents (a) a model of GHC, (b) a proof-of-concept visual analytics system applied to geographic information (geovisual analytics) designed to represent and produce GHC in collaborative crisis management situations, and (c) computational evaluations and user studies on the effectiveness of the GHC model and the proof-of-concept geovisual analytic system. \nUser studies for this research were conducted with experts from Penn State\u2019s Geographic Visualization Science, Technology, and Applications Center (GeoVISTA) and the United Nations (UN) ReliefWeb office.

Although many materials possess either high permittivity or high dielectric strength, it is the combination of the two that is needed for the development of new materials with large recoverable energy storage ~10 J/cc. This thesis is focused on understanding and improving the properties of polymer composites, with high permittivity particulate fillers, that generally su\u000bffer from poor dispersion, large dielectric loss at high \ffields and exhibit low breakdown strengths. Furthermore, it is shown that the dielectric properties of polymer/inorganic nanocomposites can be enhanced by the achieving better dispersion and designing\nengineered spatial distribution of the inorganic particulate \ffillers within the polymer matrix. Dielectrophoretic assembly and shear alignment processes are utilized to create anisotropic composites and study their corresponding electrical properties, i.e., permittivity, dielectric breakdown, and energy density as function of ceramic volume fraction and connectivity. The permittivity and recoverable energy density of composites was found to be highly dependent on the anisotropy present in the system. Experimental results indicate that x-y-aligned (perpendicular to the\nmeasuring fi\feld direction) composites exhibit higher breakdown strengths along with large recoverable energy densities when compared to 0-3 (random) composites. This demonstrated that\nengineered anisotropy can be employed to control dielectric breakdown strengths and nonlinear conduction at high fi\felds in heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, this thesis investigates the benefits of anisotropic composites with better polymers (Epoxy and PVDF-HFP) and high aspect ratio particulate \ffillers. We identify the role of interfaces in randomly dispersed biphasic and triphasic composites of organically modifi\fed montmorrillonite (OMMT) clay, barium titanate\n(BaTiO3) and Epoxy. Also, their electrical properties as function of ceramic volume fraction\nand composite morphology are examined. Final efforts are geared towards development of shear\naligned anisotropic nanocomposites with thermoplastics such as linear low density polyethylene and fluoropolymers i.e. poly(vinylidene fluoride hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)) that possess dielectric constant in the range from 10 to 14 (measured at 1 kHz).

The loss of estrogen (E2) has been implicated as a defining factor for reduced cardioprotection, yet estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) fails to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal women. Moreover, the combined effects of aging and E2-deficiency contribute to a unique high risk state for metabolic dysregulation which further drives cardiovascular disease risk in aged women. Closer examination of both direct and indirect effects of E2 and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in the context of aging and E2-deficiency is needed to help identify relevant targets for therapeutic intervention in post-menopausal women. The adipokine, adiponectin (APN), has been identified as a biomarker for CHD risk and may be influenced by aging, adiposity, and ER\u03b2. The series of four studies described herein was designed to investigate ER-signaling disruptions in metabolic and cardiac tissues as well as characterize attenuations in APN signaling capacity in a model of aging and E2-deficiency, the Fischer 344 (F344) female rat. \nThe aim of the first study (Chapter 3) was to determine the effects of acute ER\u03b2 activation on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in adult, aged, and aged E2-deficient female rats. Hearts were isolated from adult (6 mo), aged (24 mo), and aged ovariectomized (OVX) rats and subjected to 47 min of global I and 60 min of R. Rats were acutely treated with the ER\u03b2-agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) or vehicle 45 min prior to I/R. Acute treatment with DPN had no effect on functional recovery following I/R injury in adult, aged, or aged OVX female rats. \nThe aim of the second study (Chapter 4) was to determine if age-associated E2-deficiency is associated with alterations in the ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 ratio in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of female rats. We also sought to characterize changes in intra-adipocyte and circulating APN. Visceral adipose and skeletal muscle was isolated from adult and aged rats with and without OVX. ER\u03b2 protein increased in adipose of aged and aged OVX rats and ER\u03b1 increased in both adipose and gastrocnemius of aged OVX rats (p<0.05). Intra-adipocyte APN was increased and circulating APN concentration decreased in aged OVX vs adult OVX rats (p<0.05). Downstream APN targets, adiponectin receptor 2 (adipoR2), and the activated AMP-dependant kinase (pAMPK)/total AMPK ratio all decreased with age (p<0.05). Collectively, the data described in Chapter 4 suggests age-associated increases in ER\u03b2 in adipose, reduced circulating APN, and alterations in APN downstream effectors might conspire to create a metabolic phenotype associated with reduced cardioprotection. \nIn the third study (Chapter 5) we employed a direct in vitro approach to assess the effects of ER\u03b2 overexpression on APN in an adipocyte-like cell culture model, 3T3-L1 cells. Cells were transfected with ER\u03b2 plasmid construct for 24 h. Post-transfection ER\u03b2 mRNA was increased 1000-fold, yet protein levels were unchanged. In a second experiment DPN was utilized to activate ER\u03b2 in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. However, due to lack of ER responsiveness, the effects of ER\u03b2 activation on APN production or secretion in vitro were not elucidated. \n The aim of the fourth study (Chapter 6) was to determine if APN treatment is effective in conferring direct cardioprotection in the female rat heart and also to characterize changes in downstream cardiac APN targets associated with aging, E2-deficiency, and a high fat diet. Hearts were isolated from adult, aged, and aged OVX rats as described in Chapter 3 and were infused with 9 \u03bcg of APN or vehicle upon ischemia. APN infusion was successful in improving left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and end diastolic pressure (EDP) following I/R injury in all groups (p<0.05). No change in AMPK phosphorylation was observed in APN vs control I/R groups.  In a subset of perfused control hearts isolated from rats consuming a high fat diet for 20 weeks total AMPK and AdipoR1 protein was  decreased by 20% and increased by 50%, respectively relative to chow fed rats (p<0.05), which suggests APN-resistance.\nA summary of the key findings in the collection of four studies described follows. 1) Cardiac ER\u03b2 does not likely play a role in cardioprotection in the female F344 myocardium. 2) Defects in APN secretion are associated with increased ER\u03b2 in visceral adipose tissue of aged and aged OVX female rats. Unfortunately, a causal link between ER\u03b2 and APN could not be evaluated presently in vivo or in vitro models. 3) APN treatment improves post-ischemic function in the F344 female rat heart and APN or downstream APN effectors may be relevant therapeutic targets for combating CHD risk and mortality in aged women. However, high fat consumption may negate the protective effect of APN given the APN-resistant phenotype observed in aged female rats on a high fat diet.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7160], "author_name_tesi": "Tomicek, Nanette J.", "last_name_ssi": "Tomicek", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Nanette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donna Hope Korzick", "Donna Hope Korzick", "Charles H Lang", "Roger John Mccarter", "Ramesh Ramachandran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donna Hope Korzick, Dissertation Advisor", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Roger John Mccarter, Committee Member", "Ramesh Ramachandran, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging", "female", "coronary heart disease", "metabolic syndrome", "adipose"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The quantum constraint algebra in toy models of canonical gravity", "id": "19763", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Hamiltonian dynamics of canonical loop quantum gravity remains an outstanding\nopen issue.

Lateralization of skilled control, or handedness is a readily observable yet incompletely understood facet of human control of the upper extremity. Despite the ease with which hand preference is identified, the specific mechanisms producing these differences in control are difficult to integrate into existing models of control. The Dynamic Dominance hypothesis of human motor control, builds a general theory of human motor control from descriptions of the lateralization of hand and arm control. The Dynamic Dominance hypothesis stipulates that the advantage displayed by the dominant limb is in the anticipation and utilization of the dynamics of movement across multiple segments. Additionally the Dynamic Dominance hypothesis proposes that the non-dominant arm has an advantage for specifying limb postures, which often results in advantages in final position accuracy. Further these advantages are due to the lateralization of neural circuits specialized to regulate different aspects of movement. Importantly, the Dynamic Dominance hypothesis proposes that movement of each arm relies on both contralateral and ipsilateral cortex to supply different aspects of control.\nThe studies presented in this dissertation explore the generalizability of Dynamic Dominance as a model of control. These studies address three specific limitations of past work. First, since Dynamic Dominance was developed based upon data collected from constrained, planar reaches, we wished to test how well the hypothesis generalized to conditions in which gravity must be accounted for. Second, we tested the feasibility of a simple control model that simulated the discrete contribution of the two proposed hemisphere mechanisms to control to of a single movement. We were particularly interested in the ability of such a model to describe the differences in control observed in dominant and non-dominant arm movements. Finally, we examined predictions of how each hemisphere is activated during unilateral reaching. Based upon the control requirements of the task, we predicted the activity over specific areas of cortex, based upon dynamic Dominance.

The increasing awareness of malodor related problems originates from at least two factors.  First, the recent trend toward industrial scale-farming of livestock has created a large amount of manure at a single site, leading in turn to manure storage for extended periods of time (weeks to months), and to more frequent/extensive land application of manure.  Thus reducing the impact of odors on the surrounding community is becoming an essential part of managing livestock farms in order to prevent new restrictions on animal industries.  Second, odor nuisance is a rather loose term, defying operational definitions that are used to describe an extent of pollution (e.g., target pollutants) and allow setting goals for bioremediation methods. \n\tThe main objective of this study was to: develop practical application methods for using minced horseradish in the decontamination of industrial wastewaters and the deodorization of animal wastes.  These studies were expected to provide evidence for the feasibility of using plant materials to treat waste effluents of different origins.  \nThe specific objectives for the study were as follows:\n1.\tTo use additives to enhance the removal of phenols from water treated with horseradish and hydrogen peroxide.\n2.\tTo develop procedures to measure odorant concentrations in swine manure using capillary gas chromatography (GC).\n3.\tTo deodorize swine manure using minced horseradish roots and peroxides through laboratory-scale and pilot-scale testing.\nAdditives were used to facilitate the removal of 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) from water using minced horseradish (Armoracia rusticana P. Gaertn. et al.) as a carrier of peroxidase activity.  The disappearance of DCP in horseradish-treated water samples amended with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or various surfactants (75\u201390%) was greatly increased over that observed in nonamended samples (29%). The effect of PEG depended on its average molecular weight. As indicated by visible spectrophotometry, enclosing horseradish pieces between two sealed chitosan films completely eliminated colored reaction products; however, the decolorization was accompanied by a reduction in DCP removal (from 95 to 60%). On the other hand, commercially available activated carbon completely removed colored reaction products from the treated water without reducing the removal efficiency.  Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the use of additives may considerably improve the quality of wastewater treated by plant materials.\nThe next part of the study was aimed at developing and optimizing an analytical procedure to measure the odorants in swine manure using gas chromatography (GC).  Measuring malodor indicator compounds or odorants in swine manure is generally considered an essential element in evaluating the effectiveness of deodorization techniques.  In this study, seven volatile fatty acids (VFA), three phenols, and two indoles were chosen as odor indicators.  GC conditions and calibration procedures were developed and optimized for a reliable quantification of extracted odorants.  However, the extraction part of this procedure required further evaluation in a series of experiments.  The results showed that: (1) the longer the extraction times, the more odorants were extracted from swine slurry; (2) percent recoveries of odorants from a \u201cclean\u201d aqueous matrix ranged from 4.2 to 8.4% depending on the chemical identity of individual odorants; (3) the acidification step prior to extraction was necessary for efficient extraction of VFAs.  Including into consideration the results from manure deodorization studies described elsewhere in this thesis, it was concluded that the analytical procedure was optimized to the point where any further modifications might not work unless some drastic changes were introduced. Another issue was the correlation between the determined odorant concentrations and odor perception by a human panel.  In this respect, p-ethylphenol was well correlated with odor pleasantness (r = -0.72; P = 0.0017; n = 16), but not with odor intensity.  In view of the results obtained, further evaluation may be necessary, depending on the deodorization technique to be tested.  \nThe third part of the study was evaluation of the usefulness of minced horseradish roots and peroxide for the deodorization of swine manure through a series of laboratory-and pilot-scale experiments.  The principle of this deodorization method is the oxidation of odorants by the concerted action of horseradish peroxidase (present in the plant tissue) and peroxide that serves as an electron acceptor, followed by polymerization of some odorants with a possible co-polymerization or adsorption of other odorants. The deodorization effect was determined quantitatively by gas chromatography, and estimated qualitatively by a human panel.  Twelve compounds were used as odor indicators, including seven volatile fatty acids (VFAs), three phenols, and two indoles.  The project findings were as follows: (1) Malodor assessment by a human panel demonstrated the deodorizing effect as a result of horseradish treatment with hydrogen peroxide. (2) Horseradish treatment with peroxides proved to be an efficient method of removing phenolic odorants from swine manure samples. (3) Calcium peroxide was more effective than hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor in the horseradish treatment when used at the same concentration.  (4) Individual phenolic odorants were removed at different extents by the horseradish treatment. (5) Indolic odorants and VFAs in most cases were not removed during the treatment. (6) The peroxide-only and horseradish-only control treatments influenced malodor and odorant concentrations through different mechanisms (i.e., oxidation of organic matter, liberation of oxygen, and pH effect), either positively or negatively. (7) The deodorizing effect lasted for 72-h (or 3 days) after the treatment. (8) One batch of horseradish could be recycled (re-used) at least 4 times with significant reduction in odorant concentrations. (9) Comparable deodorizing effects were observed in both laboratory scale and scaled up treatments (i.e., treating 20-L swine slurry or 114-L swine slurry volumes). (10) The pilot-scale reactors as part of this project effectively separated the solid and liquid fractions of swine slurry following the treatment. (11) Combining horseradish treatment with the addition of activated alumina afforded effective acceptable phosphorus levels, without losing the deodorizing effect.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4517], "author_name_tesi": "Tonegawa, Masami ", "last_name_ssi": "Tonegawa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Masami", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerzy Dec", "Jean Marc Bollag", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Eric S Post", "Eileen Wheeler", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerzy Dec, Committee Chair", "Jean Marc Bollag, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Member", "Eileen Wheeler, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decontamination; Deodorization; Peroxidase; Horser"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Parametric Error Modeling and Software Error Compensation for Rapid Prototyping\n", "id": "6595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3660", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rapid prototyping (RP) machines can build parts of complex geometry with very little process planning and human interaction, making them a very attractive manufacturing process. However, inferior dimensional accuracy of these processes is a major obstacle preventing this technology from greater penetration of manufacturing activities. This research presents a generic method for improving the accuracy of RP machines by error compensation using \u201cvirtual\u201d parametric errors. It was inspired by techniques developed for parametric evaluation of Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM) errors.\n\nUnder this approach, the confounded effects of all errors in a RP machine were mapped into 18 \u201cvirtual\u201d parametric errors which were used to build the machine error model. A specially designed 3D artifact was then built on the RP machine and measured by a master CMM. Measurement results were used to estimate the coefficients of the parametric error functions. Error compensation based on the derived error model was finally applied via software to the files which drive the RP machine. Two compensation methods were developed and tested. The first one applied compensation to StereoLithography (STL) files while the second applied compensation to slice files. Compensation applied to slice files theoretically allows higher compensation resolution, but machine control resolution must be sufficiently fine in order to take advantage of this strategy. The resolution of the RP machine used in this study to test slice file compensation was too coarse to distinguish significant differences between slide file compensation and STL file compensation.  \n\nExperimental studies were conducted on a SLA 250 machine and a FDM 3000 system to validate and demonstrate the approach. Results showed that the volumetric error was reduced on average to around 33% of its original value for the SLA machine. In the study of a part with common features and dimensional constraints, it was found that (a) overall size of the part and feature positions on the part were considerably improved, (b) cylindrical feature sizes were improved by a small amount, and (c) dimensions along the z direction did not show obvious improvement due to \u201cz quantization\u201d. \u201cz quantization\u201d was addressed in particular to eliminate multiple layers phenomenon in compensated parts.  Compensation results of the FDM 3000 machine were compared with those of the SLA machine. Differences in error reduction ratios between these two machines were analyzed.   \n\nFinally, the design optimization problem of 3D artifact was studied. The coefficients of the \u201cvirtual\u201d parametric error functions were estimated using the error data sampled from the 3D artifact. There are potentially different artifacts that can be used to sample these errors in the RP working volume. Each will result in a different accuracy of the estimated coefficients. How to choose these sampling points in the RP working volume is a Design of Experiments (DOE) problem. D-optimality criterion was employed to verify and improve the design of the 3D artifact. Mathematical programming and simulated annealing algorithm were used for optimization of the design.\n\nIn conclusion, this research provides a low cost, generic software compensation method to improve the accuracy of a RP process with no hardware modification. \u201cVirtual\u201d parametric error functions not only enable a rational comparative evaluation of competing RP processes on the basis of a quantitative assessment of volumetric accuracy, but also serve as a diagnostic tool for the identification of direction dependent error sources due to other process characteristics.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3640], "author_name_tesi": "Tong, Kun ", "last_name_ssi": "Tong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sanjay B Joshi", "El Amine Lehtihet", "Tom Michael Cavalier", "Enrique Del Castillo", "Eric Russell Marsh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Chair", "El Amine Lehtihet, Committee Chair", "Tom Michael Cavalier, Committee Member", "Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Member", "Eric Russell Marsh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Simulated Annealing", "D-optimal Design", "Parametric Errors", "Error Compensation", "Rapid Prototyping"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An Empirical Analysis of The New York Independent System Operator's Transmission Congestion Contract Market: Speculator and Hedger Transaction Characteristics, Competition, and Profit", "id": "22416", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Transmission Congestion Contract (TCC) Market was initiated concurrently with the rollout of competitive electricity markets to provide buyers and sellers of wholesale electricity a means to hedge the locational price risk associated with their physical transactions.

The multi-period model results in an optimal quality stock level with the gradual adjustment optimal path instead of the rapid approach. When private label product is included to the setting, the national brand manufacturer generally tries to differentiate his product from the private label through the use of product quality. Both the increase in quality cost and private label quality widen the quality differentiation, raise all retail prices, and reduce the demand for the national brand product. The retailer gains higher profit through these adjustments. We extend our model to address when the national brand manufacturer supplies the private label product to the retailer. With the retailer chooses both retail prices, the optimal supply and pricing decisions of each product depend on individual product\u2019s cost and quality parameters.

A tradition of blame arose that inspired centuries of literary works devoted to the myth of Helen. The nineteenth century saw a profusion of musical interpretations, largely due to the publication of Goethe\u2019s Faust, Part Two in 1832. Compositions such as Offenbach\u2019s La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Boito\u2019s Mefistofele, though hardly masterpieces, offered a different perspective on Helen of Troy by the mere fact that they incorporated the art of music. These works turned a blind eye to the theories of Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche, however, who argued for the necessity of Gesamtkunstwerk in order to tell tales such as this one. In Nietzsche\u2019s idealized view, Greek tragedies had used a synthesis of the arts to depict mythic tragedy, fusing the Dionysian and Apollonian elements through a combination of music and language. In the post-classical era the myth remained, yet the rhetoric fragmented, posing great challenges to those who wanted to tell these stories with the same power.\nWagner did not add Helen\u2019s story to his large output, but the twentieth century brought a wave of composers influenced by his approach to music drama and ready to explore subjects that he had ignored. My thesis examines three early twentieth-century works that treat Helen of Troy in neo-Wagnerian ways, each telling a different chapter of the story. Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s 1903 opera H\u00e9l\u00e8ne explores Helen\u2019s attempted struggle against her love for Paris, Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannthal\u2019s 1928 opera Die \u00e4gyptische Helena follows the difficult recovery of Helen and Menelaus\u2019s marriage after the bloodshed at Troy, and Lili Boulanger\u2019s 1913 cantata Faust et H\u00e9l\u00e8ne considers Faust as he brings the long deceased Helen back to the world of the living for his brief pleasure. In all of these musical interpretations of the myth the tradition of blame is rejected and Helen is humanized, becoming someone we can empathize with.\nThese works use Wagnerian dramatic and musical tools, yet they are not merely epigonic. The influence of Wagner coexists with other elements\u2014modernist perspectives on the philosophical significance of music, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Boulanger\u2019s French nationality, and a post-Wagnerian conception of musical genre\u2014in updated examples of Gesamtkunstwerk that blend the Wagnerian and the anti-Wagnerian. This thesis explores how each of these works manipulates a different set of influences to form a new rhetoric of Helen of Troy, a fresh reading unique in the canon of works on her.

Since microstructure evolution under irradiation is amongst the key issues for these materials in these applications, developing a fundamental understanding of the irradiation-induced microstructure in these alloys is crucial in modeling and designing new alloys with improved properties.\nThe goal of this project was to investigate the evolution of microstructure of two commercial ferritic-martensitic steels, NF616 and HCM12A, under heavy ion irradiation at a broad temperature range. An in situ heavy ion irradiation technique was used to create irradiation damage in the alloy; while it was being examined in a transmission electron microscope. Electron-transparent samples of NF616 and HCM12A were irradiated in situ at the Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope (IVEM) at Argonne National Laboratory with 1 MeV Kr ions to ~10 dpa at temperatures ranging from 20 to 773 K. The microstructure evolution of NF616 and HCM12A was followed in situ by systematically recording micrographs and diffraction patterns as well as capturing videos during irradiation.\nIn these irradiations, there was a period during which no changes are visible in the microstructure. After a threshold dose (~0.1 dpa between 20 and 573 K, and ~2.5 dpa at 673 K) black dots started to become visible under the ion beam. These black dots appeared suddenly (from one frame to the next) and are thought to be small defect clusters (2-5 nm in diameter), possibly small dislocation loops with Burgers vectors of either \u00bd<111> or <100>.\nThe overall density of these defect clusters increased with dose and saturated around 6 dpa. At saturation, a steady-state is reached in which defects are eliminated and created at the same rates so that the defect density is constant.  After saturation, defects constantly appeared and disappeared in a time that is shorter than the time in between frames (normally 34 ms). \nThe average diameter and size distribution of the irradiation-induced defect clusters did not vary with dose during a single irradiation in the temperature range of 50 to 573 K in NF616, and 20 to 673 K in HCM12A. At 673 K, the defects in NF616 grew and coalesced under irradiation which led to larger average defect sizes and low defect density. At high doses extended defect structures in NF616 formed as short segments aligned along 100 directions. \nAt 773 K, the frequency of defect formation per unit area was the lowest amongst all irradiations and all the visible defect clusters that formed eventually faded out gradually (in ~28 seconds) leading to no net defect accumulation in NF616 even at the highest irradiation dose of 10 dpa.\nUnder irradiation, a significant fraction of these defect clusters exhibited sudden one-dimensional jumps (over ~5nm) between 20 and 573 K, that is, some defect clusters move \u201cor jump\u201d along <211> directions which is consistent with the expected Burgers vector direction of (111). Interestingly, at 673 and 773 K, defects in NF616 and HCM12A did not exhibit the sudden jumps and jerks that were frequently observed during lower temperature irradiations. \nNo resolvable loops, voids or precipitates were formed in NF616 and HCM12A. Furthermore, no signi\ufb01cant interaction of the irradiation induced defects with the foil surface, pre-existing dislocation network or grain boundaries was observed between 20 and 773 K.\nA simplified rate theory model was developed to describe the initial defect formation processes. The model is based on the reactions between intra-cascade clusters driven by the one-dimensional movement of sub-visible interstitial clusters in their glide cylinder under irradiation after detrapping from interstitial and substitutional solute atoms by cascade impact. Multiple cascade impacts on previously existing clusters allow them to gather clusters during their glide, leading to the formation of TEM-visible (~2 nm) defects. The low dose defect density approximated by model is in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, the model rationalizes the threshold dose before which no visible defect clusters were formed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9813], "author_name_tesi": "Topbasi, Cem ", "last_name_ssi": "Topbasi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Zi Kui Liu", "Clive A Randall", "Brian D Wirth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Dissertation Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Brian D Wirth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nuclear materials", "steels", "ion irradiation", "iron", "defects"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Aerodynamic Loss Models and Multi-Dimensional Prediction of Discrete Hole Film Cooling on Gas Turbine Blades", "id": "19150", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8632", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A detailed review of the literature on losses associated with film cooling is given.

Like protein, RNA is a biopolymer essential to cellular function that is known to adopt multiple alternative structures, yet much less is known about the possible involvement of RNA folding in human disease.  The protein kinase PKR is a component of the innate immune response in humans that functions by sensing molecular patterns in RNA, specifically long stretches of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that accumulate in the cell during viral infection.  Activation of PKR ultimately leads to the shut down of cellular translation and thus viral proliferation.  In this way, the ability of PKR to recognize and be activated by a wide variety of RNA structural elements is crucial to maintaining the first line of defense against viral infection.  The objective of this thesis is to characterize the structural basis of PKR activation and inhibition by various RNA elements at all three levels of the RNA folding hierarchy: primary, secondary, and tertiary.  This research may ultimately provide a connection between RNA structure and human illness. \n     At the primary structural level, experiments were performed to establish the RNA structural determinants for PKR activation by single-stranded RNAs (ssRNA) with an essential triphosphate at the 5\u2019-end.  The requirement of 5\u2019-triphosphate, which is not present in cellular RNA, for PKR activation by these ssRNAs is a novel discovery and was shown to be reproducible in vitro and in human cells.  Activation assays, structure mapping techniques, and binding studies were performed which established that in addition to the dependency on triphosphate\u2013\u2013and not diphosphate, monophosphate, or 7\u2019-methylguanosine, at the 5\u2019-end\u2013\u2013PKR activation by these ssRNAs requires short, ~5 bp \nstem loops located optimally near the center of the RNA. Additional experiments were conducted to characterize the binding pocket of this 5\u2019-triphosphate in PKR.  Competitive PKR activation assays and a variety of biophysical techniques including fluorescence competition, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and fluorescence stopped-flow indicated that PKR binds the 5\u2019-triphosphates of RNA at a site that is unique from the catalytic ATP binding site.  Results from these studies also demonstrated that the 5\u2019-triphosphate binding site is weaker in affinity and lower in specificity than the catalytic site, which potentially increases the ability of PKR to recognize a wider variety of pathogenic RNA 5\u2019-end signatures.\n    At the secondary and tertiary structural levels, PKR regulation by various elements of hepatitis C virus (HCV IRES) RNA was investigated.  Conflicting reports in the literature were resolved by performing activation and inhibition assays of the full-length IRES at a range of RNA concentrations, which established the role of the full-length HCV IRES as both an activator and inhibitor of PKR.  Additionally, individual elements of the IRES secondary structure were identified as activators, with particular emphasis on domain II, which functions as a potent activator despite its limited number of canonical basepairs. Footprinting and mutational analyses as well as modeling were utilized to establish that noncanonical regions within domain II are critical for activation through mimicry of dsRNA structure.  The role of IRES tertiary structure was also investigated through analysis of PKR activation by mutant IRES RNAs that lack this tertiary structure.  Results obtained suggest that while tertiary structure promotes optimal PKR activation, the IRES still activates well in its absence.   \n     Finally, a focused examination of the role of one specific RNA secondary motif, the tandem GA mismatch, was conducted.  Tandem GA mismatches adopt one of two distinct conformations with disparate representation in biological RNA.  The ability of PKR to distinguish between these two conformers was investigated through activation and inhibition assays of various model RNAs containing one or more mismatches of each tandem mismatch conformer.  Experiments indicated a slight preference for PKR regulation by the biologically rare conformer, suggesting that small changes in RNA structure may serve as recognition motifs of foreign RNA for PKR. \n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5355], "author_name_tesi": "Toroney, Rebecca ", "last_name_ssi": "Toroney", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

However, the field-scale implementation of these techniques has been challenging by the high cost of chemicals, which makes the margin of error for the deployment of such methods increasingly narrow. Some commonly recognized issues are surfactant adsorption, surfactant partitioning to the excess phases, surfactant thermal and physical degradation, and scale-representative microemulsion phase behavior.\nIn this dissertation, we present a novel microemulsion phase behavior model accounting for changing micellar curvature conditions under the assumption of a general prolate spheroid geometry. This approach is shown to be consistent with the definition of the three-phase solubilization ratios obtained by combining our previously developed interfacial tension model with Huh\u2019s correlation. This model removes key assumptions in recent microemulsion phase behavior model of Khorsandi and Johns (2016), such as symmetric phase behavior in the Type III region, constant characteristic length- the Type III, constant spherical geometry of micelles, and finite critical characteristic length-scale. Finally, the model is coupled with Huh\u2019s correlation to present a coupled approach that allows for the accurate capturing of both phase behavior and interfacial tensions.\nFor the case considered, the curvature model provided excellent results compared to experimental data. The results of the coupled approach are compared with results consisting of only phase behavior tuning, where the interfacial tensions are described using Huh\u2019s correlation and the standard scaling constant. For the case considered, the curvature model yielded excellent capturing of both phase behavior and interfacial tension data, whereas the alternative approach of just tuning phase behavior yielded unsatisfactory values of interfacial tensions, with discrepancies of over an order of magnitude.\nThen, we introduce a consistent and robust model that predicts interfacial tensions for all microemulsion Winsor types and overall compositions. The model incorporates film bending arguments and Huh\u2019s equation, and is coupled to phase behavior so that simultaneous tuning of both IFT and phase behavior is possible. The oil-water interfacial tension and characteristic length are shown to be related to each other through the hydrophilic-lipophilic deviation (HLD). The phase behavior is tied to the micelle curvatures, without the need for using net average curvature (NAC). \nThe interfacial tension model is tied to solubilization ratios in order to introduce a coupled interfacial tension-phase behavior model for all phase environments. The approach predicts two- and three-phase interfacial tensions and phase behavior (i.e. tie lines and tie triangles) for changes in composition and HLD input parameters, such as temperature, pressure, surfactant structure parameters, and oil equivalent alkane carbon number. Comparisons to experimental data show excellent fits and predictive capability.\nFurther, we introduce a new empirical phase behavior model based on chemical potentials and . The model is able to describe physical two-phase regions, and is shown to represent accurately experimental data at fixed composition and changing  (e.g. a salinity scan) as well as variable composition data at fixed . Further, the model is extended to account for surfactant partitioning into the excess phases. The model is benchmarked against experimental data (considering both pure alkane and crude oil cases), showing excellent fits for a wide variety of experiments, and is compared to the -NAC EoS model for reference.\nIn this research, we allow for surfactant partitioning into both the water and oil excess phases using a simple approach, and then relate the relevant surfactant partitioning coefficients to the  state function so that all independent K-values are predicted for all Winsor environments. Surfactant screening based on EO and PO groups is also considered based on estimated K-values. Key dimensionless groups as a function of activity coefficients are identified, which allow for a simplified description of the surfactant partition coefficients. As an example, the surfactant partition coefficients are combined with the CP equation-of-state model to describe and predict the phase behavior when the excess phases are not pure.\n\tOne common theme in all contributions in this dissertation is the emphasis on having improved predictive capabilities.

Geomechanical properties of complex porous systems are dynamically linked to flow conditions, but their feedback relationship is often oversimplified due to the difficulty of representing pore-scale stress deformation and multiphase flow characteristics in high fidelity. In this work we performed pore-scale experiments of single- and multi-phase flow through bead packs at different confining pressure conditions to elucidate compaction-dependent characteristics of granular packs and their impact on fluid flow. A series of drainage and imbibition cycles was conducted on a water-wet soda-lime glass bead pack under varying confining stress conditions. Simultaneously, X-ray micro-CT was used to visualize and quantify the degree of compaction and fluid distribution corresponding with each stress condition and injection cycle. Micro-CT images were segmented using a gradient-based method to identify fluids (e.g. oil and water), and solid phase redistribution throughout the different experimental stages. Results demonstrate that the degree of compaction has a significant influence on phase trapping. It was found that an increase in confining pressure has a stabilizing effect on the displacing front during both drainage and imbibition. Alternatively, the compaction process was found to promote the disconnection of non-wetting blobs during imbibition, which in turn results into poor oil recovery by water flooding. In addition, the changes of both porosity and tortuosity were dampened as the confining pressure was increased. Finally, specific surface area was found to be more sensitive to stress conditions than porosity, which suggests that caution must be taken when considering scalability of these properties for practical modeling purposes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9459], "author_name_tesi": "Torrealba, Victor Antonio", "last_name_ssi": "Torrealba", "middle_name_ssi": "Antonio", "first_name_ssi": "Victor", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["porous media", "compaction", "multiphase fluids", "pore-scale", "drainage", "imbibition", "X-ray CT scanning"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Clean Slate: Making Sense of Public Education in the \"NEW\" New Orleans\n\n", "id": "11248", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4110", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hurricane Katrina has been called the worst natural disaster in the United States.

A recent study indicates that pressures from climate change will be most keenly felt in markets where companies see important opportunities for growth, such as Brazil, China, Mexico and the USA. Therefore, assessing the carbon footprint, environmental impact and other sustainability measures of suppliers in these countries is key to targeting weak areas in the supply chain. However, to make an efficient allocation of their limited resources and reduce the vulnerability of supply disruptions, companies need to match procurement decisions with the levels of risk brought by the different suppliers.\nIn this dissertation, we develop decision making models that align sustainability goals with the corporate goals from the perspective of the purchasing function. First, we develop a Supplier Sustainability Risk Assessment Framework (SSRAF) to quantify the potential risks to the sustainability of the supply chain for different supplier segments. The supplier segments are represented through a 4x4 matrix (8 quadrants) with the cost of products on the x-axis (Low/High), supply risk on the y-axis (Low/High) and sustainability impact on the z-axis (Low/High). We are interested in assessing only the sustainability risk of four supplier segments representing a High impact on sustainability. They include: (1) Tactical items with low supply risk and cost, (2) Leverage items with low supply risk/high cost, (3) Critical items with high supply risk/low cost and (4) Strategic items with high supply risk and cost. A supply risk score is determined from a qualitative assessment of three factors: hazard, vulnerability, and risk management practice incorporating the perspective of different stakeholders. We apply the SSRAF to quantify the suppliers\u2019 sustainability risks for a global manufacturer of consumer products located in M\u00e9xico and develop supplier management methods based on the risks identified for the different items. For each of the four supplier segments considered, we formulate different optimization models and solve them using goal programming and other methods. \nFor Tactical items, we propose a goal programming model that incorporates all unit quantity discounts based on the dollar value of all items purchased. The objective function evaluates total purchase price, quality, late delivery and sustainability performance to determine what product to order from which supplier. We use trade-off matrices to summarize the achievements for the various objectives under different scenarios. \nFor Leverage items, we use a three phase methodology. In phase one, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to pre-qualify a large set of initial suppliers by the estimation of their eco-efficiency scores. Then, a Multiple Criteria Ranking method is applied for a single sourcing strategy and a Bi-criteria Optimization Model (BOM) is used for a multiple sourcing strategy, with eco-efficiency scores and total purchase price as conflicting objectives. The BOM also incorporates all unit quantity discounts based on the total dollar value. In the third phase, we monitor supplier eco-efficiency changes for adjoining time periods using an Eco-efficiency Productivity Index (EPI).  Furthermore, we decompose EPI to distinguish between the eco-efficiency changes due to innovations in technology and those due to the sustainability initiatives of the suppliers. The methodology is applied to an autoparts manufacturer in Mexico. \nFor Critical products, which are items representing a small proportion of the overall costs but a very high level of service disruption, we assume that a global sourcing strategy is in place and propose a multi-criteria optimization model for identifying primary and backup suppliers to mitigate disruption risks. The quantitative model optimizes total purchase cost, lead time, supplier risk and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Total purchase cost includes product costs, transportation costs and costs resulting from exceeding GHG emissions. \nFinally, Strategic items represent high supply risk and high profits. As climate change and other sustainability threats gain relevance, it becomes fundamental for purchasing managers to assess not only the capacities and risks of the strategic suppliers but also the economic benefits gained by investing in long-term partnerships. We propose a modified form of the Supplier Sustainability Risk Assessment Framework (SSRAF) using Multiple Criteria Ranking and Rating methods to improve the risk assessment given by individual decision makers. In addition, the cost avoided by implementing a long-term environmental risk avoidance strategy with the supplier is used along with the supplier sustainability risk score to build a pay-off matrix and interactively obtain the buyer preferences among different suppliers.\nThe optimization models for Critical and Strategic segments are also evaluated using the data collected from a global manufacturer of consumer products and from bibliographic sources.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10731], "author_name_tesi": "Torres, Aineth ", "last_name_ssi": "Torres", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aineth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Gul Kremer", "Charles David Ray Sr.", "Paul M Griffin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Dissertation Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member", "Charles David Ray Sr., Committee Member", "Paul M Griffin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supply Chain", "Green Supply Chain", "Procurement", "Supplier", "Sustainability", "Eco-efficiency", "Portfolio Management", "Supply Risk"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Play As Expression: An Analysis Based On The Philosophy Of Maurice Merleau-Ponty", "id": "5918", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1135", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Play has been an object of reflection since classical antiquity.  However, it was not until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that play received a genuine and systematic treatment in academic circles.  Most of the theories that emerged during this period were strongly influenced by the success of empirical methods of investigation.  Play, then, was not primarily understood as a subjective and meaningful way of relating, experiencing, or unfolding in the world but as an objective process capable of being isolated, measured, and manipulated.  Around the 1930s this understanding of play was seen as too restrictive and reductionistic, and a movement attempting to explore and understand play\u2019s intrinsic strength to seduce, captivate, and absorb people emerged.  Unfortunately, most of these projects sought a definitive play logos, distanced player from playgrounds, and failed to realize their interrelationship.\n\tThis dissertation attempts to return to the originality of the lived experience of play.  Rather than focusing on players and playgrounds as two objective structures, the goal of this project is to explore and describe the dynamic style of being manifested at play in its immediate lived embodiment and expression.  Such an account uncovers the different layers of the intricate and fluid interplay between players and playgrounds which is constitutive and definitive of play.  I explore the experience of play using the philosophic insights of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, for it honors and respects people\u2019s irreducible dialogue with the world and that which is expressed in it.  Play is seen, then, as a special mode of disclosing peoples\u2019 projects toward the world.  In this dissertation I distinguish qualitatively different modes of play, reevaluate their role and significance for society and education, and suggest practical applications to promote educational environments in which play is more likely to appear. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1123], "author_name_tesi": "Torres, Cesar R.", "last_name_ssi": "Torres", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Cesar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Doug Anderson", "John E Russon", "John Andrew Lucas", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Mark Dyreson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Doug Anderson, Committee Member", "John E Russon, Committee Member", "John Andrew Lucas, Committee Member", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Chair", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phenomenology", "education", "expression", "play"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Understanding Self-Regulation, Links to School Readiness, and Implications for Intervening with High-Risk Children", "id": "12248", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4292", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "School entry presents young children with a new set of social and learning demands theorized to be heavily reliant on the development of self-regulation.  Children delayed in their development of self-regulation are at heightened risk for problems when they enter school, including difficulty with learning readiness, problematic relationships with teachers and peers, and behavior problems (Blair, 2002).  Conceptually, self-regulation is a multi-faceted construct, reflecting the capacity to control impulses, focus and shift attention, and regulate emotion.  This set of skills develops rapidly between the ages of 3-7, dependent upon the maturation of the pre-frontal cortex.  Although these skills are inter-related developmentally, studies rarely examine them at the same time, raising questions about the degree to which they represent distinct capacities that make unique contributions to school readiness.  Collecting multiple measures selected specifically to tap skills relevant to behavioral, emotional, and attentional regulation, the current study provided evidence for a 3-factor structure of self-regulation and documented unique contributions of behavioral, emotional and attentional dimensions to school readiness.  In addition, a pilot study suggested that pre-intervention deficits in these self-regulatory skills attenuated response to an innovative time-limited social competence coaching program, although evidence for the malleability of some self-regulatory skills (emotional understanding) also emerged. Implications for developmental models and intervention designs targeting the self-regulatory deficits and school readiness of at-risk children are discussed.

These communities are restricted to manufactured housing methods, which have a low initial cost but are not durable or energy efficient, and thus incur high operation and maintenance costs. Moreover, being an imported solution, manufactured housing makes limited use of local labor and resources, in communities where employment and economic growth are greatly needed.\n\nCurrent trends in housing construction are demonstrating the long-term benefits of sustainable or \u201cgreen\u201d housing projects. At the same time, innovations in housing construction are promoting a quicker and more efficient delivery process, without compromising affordability or quality. However, sustainable housing solutions and housing innovations are still not available in low-income rural communities. Therefore, an effective integration of these technologies into a construction strategy, which optimizes prefabrication and local labor utilization, is required to develop better homes and create jobs in the communities themselves.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, this research evaluates the feasibility of a hybrid \"prefabricated / site-built\u201d strategy that combines the economies of manufactured housing processes with the economic benefits of localized material choices and job creation. The study aims to identify the attributes of a hybrid strategy that can be replicated for large-scale implementation in low-income rural communities. The strategy includes a prefabricated technical core and a site-built envelope. The prefabrication of the core employs effectively scarce skilled labor in a mass production environment.

The research includes a rigorous economic analysis of the prototype home itself, and the new hybrid construction strategy. The results are intended to promote a clear understanding of the potential for sustainable housing to provide means for community development within low-income communities. By addressing simultaneously the environmental, social and economic considerations of sustainable housing, it is hoped that this research provides incentive for the construction of additional sustainable homes in these regions, in turn stimulating job creation, business opportunities, and economic growth.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1265], "author_name_tesi": "Torres Arriaga, Claudia ", "last_name_ssi": "Torres Arriaga", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Claudia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii", "Michael J Horman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii, Thesis Advisor", "Michael J Horman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["prefabrication strategies", "affordable housing", "sustainable housing"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING GENDER ROLES THROUGH CHILDREN\u2019S PLAY EPISODES IN\nAN EARLY CHILDHOOD SETTING, AS PART OF PUERTO RICAN\nCULTURE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY", "id": "10419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nThis dissertation presents an exploratory multiple case\nstudy conducted in a preschool center in the north-eastern\npart of Puerto Rico. The study explores in what ways fouryear-\nold children\u2019s gender roles become apparent through\nplay episodes, focusing on the following research\nquestions: 1. What expressions of gender roles expectations\nare reflected in children\u2019s play? 2. How does culture\ninfluence or impact the gender roles decisions made through\nplay? 3. What are the boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 preferred activities\nand toys during play? 4. How do parents perceive the\nculture (home, Puerto Rican, family, etc.) in their\nchildren\u2019s play? 5. How does the teacher see the culture\n(home, Puerto Rican, family, etc.) in her student\u2019s play?\nPlay and gender roles are my basic concerns and\ninterests in the ECE field. Sadly, research in Puerto Rico\nabout gender roles, play, and early childhood is\npractically non-existent (Canales Guzman, 2008). The\nrationale behind this study is to contribute to this new\nfield by making an impact on parents, teachers, principals,\nand others in the education of our children, in relation to\ncreate awareness in equity and social justice. This multiple case study was carried out in one\nclassroom of a preschool center in Carolina, Puerto Rico.\nAfter observing and interacting with the whole group during\napproximately two months, I chose the two boys and two\ngirls using two different criteria. First, I wanted to\nhave as my cases the boys and girls who represented the\nrest of the group in most ways. Second, I wanted children\nthat are leaders, those that call your attention\nimmediately when entering the classroom.\nData pertaining to children were obtained by three\nmethods: direct observation of play episodes dynamics,\nstructured task activities, and a focus group. All of\nthese methods were directed toward describing children\u2019s\nbehaviors and beliefs regarding gender-norms in the Puerto\nRican culture and how their beliefs expressed on the tasks\nand in the focus groups are related to their social\ninteraction and symbolical and object actions in play\nepisodes.\nSecondly, the study focused on the voices of the\nparents and the teacher. This study investigated the four\nchildren\u2019s parents\u2019 and their teacher\u2019s understanding and\nideas about gender roles at home and school. These data\nwere compared with the data obtained from children.\nDiscussion and interpretation of the findings was guided by Rogoff\u2019s cultural historical theory,\nBronfenbrenner\u2019s Ecological model, and Super and Harkness\ndevelopmental niche framework.\nThe study generated evidence helpful in answering the\nfive research questions. Gender role socialization among\nchildren in a Puerto Rican preschool center, specially seen\nin the dramatic play, seems largely determined by\ntraditional stereotyped gender roles. However, there were\nalso some indications in parents and teacher interview of\ntension, conflict, and change suggesting a culture in\ntransition.\nAn implication of this study is that it is our\nresponsibility to work with children during the early years\nand use educational arrangement and play to foster gender\nequity in society.\nThe biggest contribution to the ECE field is to\nexplore what is going on in our own Puerto Rican culture to\nstart creating awareness between our educators and parents\nabout how to create opportunities that promote and\nencourage equity and social justice.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4278], "author_name_tesi": "Torres-Crespo, Marisel N.

These texts also reveal two variations of this separate subjectivity. In his social poems, Dasan Jeong Yagyong (1762\u20131836) reveals a paradigm of subjective distinction that translates into free will and responsibility, which supports his main purpose of ethical action in the world. Thus, the Dasanian subject, while distinct from the world, remains engaged. The writings of Hwang Sayeong, Yi Suni, and Choe Haedu also express a subjective distinction from the world. In their case, this distinction is based on loyalty to a transcendent authority represented by the Church and by belief in the soul\u2019s immortality. Hwang, Yi, and Choe, like Dasan, represent the human being as distinct from the world, free to choose, and responsible to act righteously. However, their writings manifest an increasing focus upward to the transcendent world of heaven and inward to the individual soul, and greater disengagement with the world. \n     In light of this examination, is it possible to assert that the introduction of Western Catholic thought contributed to Korea\u2019s transition to modernity? Inasmuch as the separation of human agency from the cosmic order was the point at which Dasan, Hwang Sayeong, Yi Suni, and Choe Haedu diverged from the dominant worldview of their milieu, Catholic-influenced discourse might indeed be said to have contributed to the movement toward a modern consciousness of distinct human subjectivity. On the other hand, the moral impetus of these writings and their expressed subjective dependence on heaven or God also trouble any clear-cut identification with the autonomous modern subject. Considering these points of identification with both modern and pre-modern subjectivity, Catholic-influenced discourse may be associated with the category of \u201ctransitional literature\u201d that reflects the changes and the tensions of late Joseon Korea.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1431], "author_name_tesi": "Torrey, Deberniere Janet", "last_name_ssi": "Torrey", "middle_name_ssi": "Janet", "first_name_ssi": "Deberniere", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Ronnie Po Chia Hsia", "Alexander C Y Huang", "Arthur Richard Nichols", "Donald G Baker Jr.", "Cho Sung Won"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Chair", "Ronnie Po Chia Hsia, Committee Member", "Alexander C Y Huang, Committee Member", "Arthur Richard Nichols, Committee Member", "Donald G Baker Jr., Committee Member", "Cho Sung Won, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Korean catholicism", "confucianism", "subjectivity in literature", "literature and religion", "korean literature", "subject consciousness"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Latina Mothers' Enactments of Agency: Achieving Desires through Discourses in Family Literacy.\n", "id": "11476", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "842", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative study used a post-structural feminist framework to examine how the literacy and mothering discourses women encountered in a family literacy program assisted or constrained them in enacting agency.

Their narratives demonstrated how the literacy and parenting discourses inherent in this educational program shaped some of their daily practices and self-perceptions. The findings demonstrate that the women used these discourses to expand their identities, to meet personal goals, and to gain greater power in some spheres of their life, such as relationships with their husbands and other family members.

The components that are manufactured in this facility are used in the drilling and extraction operations of oil wells. \nThis thesis includes construction of process flows, inter and intra-departmental information flows, cause and effect diagrams, Six Sigma SIPOC diagrams and interaction maps, as the initial phase of a project followed by a high level overview of the processes previous to final assembly. Furthermore, detailed construction of assembly timelines (histograms) using three conventional stack projects and four configurable stack projects were developed. The last four projects were used to develop four different assembly scenarios to present simulated solutions of workforce allocation and labor utilization concerns as a means to increase overall throughput at the stack pad. Assuming no delays cause by pre-assembly processes, calculations of the average available man hours, minimum achievable times for each assembly operation and a vetting process of all the results, stack pad throughput was calculated for the last three scenarios considering different labor utilizations. The first scenario was developed as an ideal approach using a Gantt chart simulation criterion where total touch and idle/wait times were calculated and compared with standard times for a precedence constraint manufacturing process with no delays. \nAfter developing the assembly labor utilization scenarios, it was found that variations in labor capacity have a big impact in stack pad throughput. As a consequence, considerations have to be made to labor scheduling in order to lower costs by optimizing the labor allocation at any given point in time. In addition, many considerations have to be taken into account to eliminate the no delay assumptions and consider different strategies to develop a no delay report system and root cause analyses procedures to address the relevant issues affecting final assembly.

My dissertation brings together the subfield of philosophy called \u201crace theory\u201d with literary representations of racial others discussed in these theories, with a particular emphasis on the Chinese and Jews. For the purposes of this dissertation, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\u2019s Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Philosophie der Geschichte (Lectures on the Philosophy of History) will serve as a representative of ideas discursively circulating between philosophical, historical, philological, and biological/ physiological traditions. Hegel maintains that the Chinese and Jews lack the freedom of thought necessary to make decisions on their own and defer to figures of authority, the Emperor for the Chinese and God for the Jews. I argue that Kafka\u2019s literary works have the versatility to expose the construction of race as a concept within race theory and by extension undermine Euro-centric assumptions made about non-European others. I defer to performance theory, in particular Brecht\u2019s notion of Verfremdungseffekt (Alienation Effect), which he formed after watching Mei Lanfang\u2019s performance of a Beijing Opera in Moscow, mediated through Walter Benjamin\u2019s redemptive reading of Kafka, and through the lenses of Judith Butler\u2019s notion of gender-performance and Tina Chen\u2019s application of Butler and Brecht in readings of Asian-American representations in literature. In the first two chapters of this dissertation I will look at Hegel\u2019s thoughts on the Chinese and Jews alongside Kafka\u2019s literary works \u201cBeim Bau der Chinesischen Mauer\u201d (\u201cThe Great Wall of China\u201d), \u201cEin altes Blatt\u201d (\u201cAn Old Manuscript\u201d), \u201cDie Abweisung\u201d (\u201cThe Refusal\u201d), \u201cDas Stadtwappen\u201d (\u201cThe City Coat of Arms\u201d), \u201cAbraham,\u201d and \u201cDas Paradies\u201d (\u201cParadise\u201d).

These simulations often involve the solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations.  \nThe solution time of these large, sparse linear systems\ndominates the execution time of the simulation.  The choice of the linear system solution methods, in association with the characteristics of a given problem, directly influence the execution time.\nSelecting an effective solution method to match problem parameters is a key factor in reducing execution time and improving the performance and accuracy of the solution.  The vast number of solution methods and the variability of the performance of solvers based on characteristics of a given problem make it difficult to determine the optimal method.  Recent investigation in this domain have used machine learning techniques to choose an optimal solver.  However, the computation of problem characteristics required by the learning algorithms are often time and memory intensive.  For example, calculating problem characteristics, such as eigenvalues, can cause those techniques to take as long or more than running the solver. \nIn this thesis, we present a method which utilizes low cost machine learning classifiers to select a solver for a given sparse system.  We present a method for reducing the feature space of \nmodel characteristics, henceforth features.  We use machine learning algorithms to produce classifiers and then compare their predictive accuracy and time for construction.  We observe that these classifiers are less computationally expensive than the solver computation time.

Works by Lajos Kassak - writer,poet, artists, editor, the main mover and guidig star of MA, - the painter Sandor Bortnyik, the polymath Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and the designer Marcel Breuer are investigated based on a particular agenda. First, the study considers how the failure of a revolutionary reorganization of society during the Hungarian Soviet Republic (April 23-Aug 1, 1919) prompted the Hungarian Activists to reassess their lofty political ideas in exile and make compromises if they wanted to remain in the vanguard of modernity. Second, it explores how their mission of \"revolutionary activation\" became transformed by Moholy-Nagy into an educative preoccupation to train and activate the senses and perception in coping with the multifarous phenomena and increasingly accelerating pace of modernity. By the end of the Weimar era Moholy-Nagy's educative-activist aganda nonetheless would prove problematic, as his modernist works become absorbed into the urban consumerist spectacle in a conflicted and ambiguous manner, as both its leading agent and an alternative means of liberation from it. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1918], "author_name_tesi": "Toth, Edit  ", "last_name_ssi": "Toth", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Edit ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Sarah K Rich", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Michael Bernhard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Committee Chair", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Member", "Michael Bernhard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hungarian modernism", "activism", "kinetic art", "Weimar visual culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Reactivity of Epicatechin in Maillard Chemistry\n", "id": "7027", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6414", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nThe Maillard reaction, a carbonyl-amino condensation reaction, is a ubiquitous chemical reaction in nature and a well-documented critical food (flavor, color, nutritional value, toxicity) and biological reaction that involves aging, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, etc.  Polyphenolic components (of plant origin) have not been considered as reactants in the thermally catalyzed reactions involved in flavor generation.  This study primarily focuses on understanding the mechanisms of how epicatechin (a polyphenolics compound) functions as a reactant in Maillard model systems and in particular with Maillard reaction transient intermediates using GC, GC-MS, LC/MS and NMR analysis for structural confirmation.  \nPreliminary experiments conducted on aqueous Maillard model systems consisting of 4 amino acids plus 2 hexose sugars indicated that the addition of epicatechin or epigallocatechin gallate dramatically altered (reduced) the generation of Maillard-type flavor compounds.  The mechanisms of how EC behaves as a reactants in Maillard chemistry were subsequently investigated by labeling studies (13C, 15N) in an aqueous glucose-glycine model system.  Analysis of the volatile flavor compounds was conducted on model consisting of CAMOLA systems (1:1 - 13C6 : 12C6)glucose and glycine indicated that the flavor compounds - 2,3-butanedione, acetol, pyrazine, 2-methylpyrazine, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine were essentially derived from intact C4, C3, C2/C2, C2/C3, and C3/C3 sugar fragments, respectively.  Analysis of the non-volatiles by LC/MS indicated that epicatechin combined with C2, C3, and C4 sugar fragments to form adduct reaction products which were otherwise absent in control a sample with no epicatechin added.  Glycine was not required under these reaction conditions to catalyze glucose fragmentation, as similar adduct reaction products were obtained when glucose was directly combined with EC.\nThe identity of the individual sugar fragments that were being trapped by epicatechin in aqueous Maillard systems was established by direct comparison of LC/MS peak retention times and ion abundances.  The LC/MS chromatograms of epicatechin-sugar fragment adducts generated in the glucose/glycine system were compared with adducts generated via direct combination of epicatechin and well- known sugar carbonyls \u2013 glyoxal, acetol, glyceraldehyde, methylglyoxal etc. Based on the comparison of chromatogram of the adduct peaks, the key contributors of the C2, C3 and C4 epicatechin-sugar fragments were identified as glyoxal, acetol and erythrose (based on their chromatogram responses).  To further examine the mechanisms of EC-carbonyl adduct generation, the structural properties of a pure EC-methylglyoxal adduct reaction product was analyzed by NMR.  The 1-D (1H and 13C)and 2-D NMR (1H-1H COSY, HMBC, HMQC) analysis were conducted at low temperature (-25\u00b0C) to slow down the rapid conformation exchange as indicated by 1H-NMR analysis of the purified adduct.  The 2-D NMR suggested the covalent linkage between the C1 position of the methylglyoxal and either the C6 or C8 position of the epicatechin A-ring by a aromatic substitution reaction.  \nIn conclusion, the reduction of flavor generation due to addition of epicatechin in Maillard model systems was ascribed to direct trapping of C2, C3 and C4 carbonyl compounds in aqueous model systems.  Further the identification that EC formed covalent bonds with reactive carbonyl such as glyoxal, methylglyoxal provides a new mechanism for elucidating the epidemiological evidence supporting a positive health link between dietary intake of polyphenolic flavonoids and the reduction of several age-related chronic diseases.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6415], "author_name_tesi": "Totlani, Vandana Manohar", "last_name_ssi": "Totlani", "middle_name_ssi": "Manohar", "first_name_ssi": "Vandana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Devin Peterson", "Dr A Daniel Jones", "Robert Bruce Beelman", "Dr Donald Thompson", "Dr Koushik Seetharaman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Devin Peterson, Committee Chair", "Dr A Daniel Jones, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member", "Dr Donald Thompson, Committee Member", "Dr Koushik Seetharaman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reactivity of dicarbonyls", "flavonoids", "epicatechin", "carbonyl", "Maillard", "NMR"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Student Perceptions of the Use of a Discussion-Based Tool to Support Learning\n", "id": "7115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5435", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a qualitative collective case study involving the perceptions of six undergraduate students on the modified use of a discussion based tool to support student learning.

Guided by emotional security theory, the current investigation sought to advance research on interparental violence and young children\u2019s emotional, physiological, and behavioral regulation. Using a large, diverse sample of couples with young children living low-income, non-urban communities, the following two studies utilized mixture modeling techniques to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced view of interparental violence and young children\u2019s emotional responses and regulatory skills. \nStudy 1 examined the linkages between interparental violence, self-regulatory behaviors, and the development of stress response patterns across early childhood. Latent profile analysis revealed distinct patterns of adrenocortical and behavioral stress responses at 7-, 15-, and 24-months of age (7m n = 735; 15m n = 634; 24m n = 567). Interparental violence was linked with unique patterns of responding to emotion-eliciting stressors in infancy and toddlerhood, although stress responses at 15-months appeared unrelated to family functioning. Further, infant and toddler stress responses were linked with the use of specific self-regulatory strategies, suggesting possible patterns of adaptation to violent homes. Latent transition analysis revealed substantial reorganization in stress responses across early childhood, and a trajectory of risk if children did not transition to well-regulated stress-response profiles. \nStudy 2 examined whether the presence of severe interparental violence in the home was associated with differences in emotion regulation processes at 24-months of age (n = 427). Using hidden Markov modeling, differences in the organization and unfolding of emotional expressions and regulatory actions were found for children from violent homes. Specifically, toddlers from violent homes appeared to have difficulties redirecting attention away from the source of their frustration or communicating their desires to caregivers at low levels of negative reactivity, and engaged in more disruptive forms of anger release as they became more upset, relative to children from non-violent homes. The presence of severe interparental violence was also linked with higher levels of negative reactivity when children became distressed, as well as fewer states characterized by neutral affect. Further, the degree of violence appeared to make a difference, as children from more violent homes spent a greater amount of time in highly distressed states. Collectively, these findings suggest specific deficits in foundational emotional and regulatory skills linked with interparental violence, highlighting the need for further research examining the processes and pathways through which these linkages occur, and the need for interventions directly addressing these deficits.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4683], "author_name_tesi": "Towe, Nissa  Rhiaan", "last_name_ssi": "Towe", "middle_name_ssi": "Rhiaan", "first_name_ssi": "Nissa ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Stifter", "Cynthia Stifter", "Douglas Michael Teti", "Mark T Greenberg", "Michael J Rovine", "Pamela Marie Cole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Stifter, Dissertation Advisor", "Cynthia Stifter, Committee Chair", "Douglas Michael Teti, Committee Member", "Mark T Greenberg, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Pamela Marie Cole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Early Childhood", "Interparental Violence", "Emotion Regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Examination of Cyclical Isomorphism and the Micro-effects of Hospital Accreditation", "id": "17625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8448", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hospital accreditation inspections are at once highly institutionalized and predictably cyclical, creating the potential for waves of isomorphic response (i.e. convergence around commonly legitimized standards of structure or action in a field) among accredited hospitals.

This dissertation explores these phenomena by integrating diverse theory and employing robust empirical methodology.\n\nFollowing an introductory chapter, Chapter Two builds a conceptual framework to theoretically argue that triennial accreditation inspections may trigger a shift in organizational attention patterns in hospitals.  This shift, the framework suggests, may impact clinical outcomes for patients and influence the attitudes of hospital personnel in ways that may affect hospital survivability.  \n\nChapter Three presents the first of two empirical studies aimed at testing portions of the conceptual framework.  In this study, monthly risk-adjusted mortality rates in fifty-eight New Jersey hospitals are observed over a ten year period to assess significant changes in mortality rates during reaccreditation cycles.  The analysis reveals, in fact, that mortality rates tend to improve momentarily following inspections but that improvements tend to fade away in subsequent weeks.\n\nChapter Four presents the second empirical study, which examines the extent to which organizational \u201cjolts\u201d caused by reaccreditation inspections trigger reassessment of the legitimacy of the hospital among hospital personnel.  The analysis suggests that accreditation inspections are, in fact, capable of jolting hospitals with sufficient force to trigger judgment reassessment but that individuals are not likely to retain and put into use the new judgments as hospitals likely regress toward heterogeneity following inspections.  \n\nThe final chapter synthesizes the notable theoretical and empirical contributions to the academic literature offered in these papers and comprehensively discusses the practical implications of these contributions for policy makers, accrediting bodies and hospital leaders.  Also, as the work represents but a first step toward understanding cyclical isomorphism and the micro-effects of hospital accreditation, the chapter concludes with a discussion of opportunities to expand on the ideas presented here and to explore new avenues of research.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8356], "author_name_tesi": "Towers, Tyler John", "last_name_ssi": "Towers", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Tyler", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Rogers Clark", "Jonathan Rogers Clark", "Susan Diane Brannon", "Deirdre Mccaughey", "Glen Kreiner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Rogers Clark, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Rogers Clark, Committee Chair", "Susan Diane Brannon, Committee Member", "Deirdre Mccaughey, Committee Member", "Glen Kreiner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cyclical Isomorphism", "Organizational Attention", "Hospital Accreditation", "Legitimacy Judgment", "Patient Mortality"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Automated Calibration and a Correction Scheme for Total Pressure Gradient Effects of Subminiature Five-Hole Probe", "id": "14148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7146", "abstract_tesi": "Five-hole probes, being a dependable and accurate aerodynamic tool, are an excellent choice for measuring three dimensional flow fields.  However, they are traditionally difficult to calibrate by hand.  With advancements in computer technology, it is possible to improve the calibration process that is made up of tedious and repetitive probe measurements obtained at various pitch and yaw angles.  Secondly, they are susceptible to flow with strong pressure or velocity gradients in them.\n\nThis thesis first proposes an improvement by using computer automation, a mechanical pressure scanner, and precision rotary tables to significantly reduce the amount of time required to complete the calibration sequence.  A five-hole probe is fastened to a precision calibration mechanism in a wind tunnel test section.  This mechanism varies the pitch and yaw angle of the probe accurately via two computer controlled rotary tables.  This approach allows for a much greater degree of accuracy and a way to increase the number of data points, which better defines the non-linear portions of the calibration maps.  The scanivalve system minimizes the number of transducers required from seven to one.  While this approach takes more time than having multiple transducers, it lowers the overall equipment cost and helps reduce measurement errors.  A data acquisition device provides an interface between the rotary table stepper controllers, the scanivalve controller, and the transducer.  A graphical interface is used to control all of the devices.  This graphical device interface simultaneously retrieves data from the transducer/amplifier and transforms it into the coefficients forming the calibration map.  This program allows for a degree of flexibility, enabling the user to choose the range of angles and degrees between lines of the calibration map.\n\nTotal pressure gradients can induce error into a five-hole probe's measurements.  The pressure gradients cause the probe  to measure slightly different conditions.  The combined effect of the different flow conditions on the ports causes the measured total pressure to be prone to greater error.  Having found that the available data for total pressure gradient related corrections for a five-hole probes is very limited in open literature, this thesis proposes a way to correct for this measurement.\n\nThis correction is based on the difference between the measured total pressure data of a Kiel probe and a sub-miniature prism type five-hole probe.  A Kiel probe is not prone to errors caused by total pressure gradients, making it a good choice for accurate measurement.  By comparing them in a ducted fan rotor exit field, a line of best fit is constructed.  The line of best fit is dependent on the slope of the line (total pressure coefficient versus span location) and the difference in total pressure coefficient between the probes at the same location.\n\nAn automated program, written in MATLAB, does the comparison and creates the correction equation.  Afterward, the equation is applied to the five-hole probe total pressure coefficient, and the other dependent values are adjusted.  The validity of the correction is tested by placing the Kiel probe and the five-hole probe in a ducted fan test facility with a variety of different tip clearances.  Multiple tip clearance values generate a set of different total pressure gradients near the casing region of the rotor exit flow field.  The correction method is found to produce more accurate results in flow fields that are tested.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7136], "author_name_tesi": "Town, Jason Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Town", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Thesis Advisor", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Five-hole probe", "automated", "calibration", "correction", "total pressure gradient"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of Rim Seal/Disk Cavity Flow and its Interaction with High Pressure Turbine Rotor Flows", "id": "25012", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11003", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ingestion and egression of hot gas path fluid into the rim seal cavity of an axial flow turbine is usually mitigated by the use of purge flow.  The purge flow arrives into a disk cavity space from the final stage of the compressor and is very expensive in terms of total system efficiency.  Cycle analysis for a gas turbine clearly indicates the significant efficiency penalty for the use of high pressure compressor air for cooling or disk cavity space purge action.  Furthermore, the purge flow modifies flow structures inside and downstream of the cavity where the purge flow mixes with hot mainstream gasses.  This thesis provides an understanding of the modes of ingestion and egression of the rim seal cavity.  A review of previous studies pertaining to the effects of purge ingress/egress and methods of mitigation is provided.  New testing in a simulated disk cavity space is performed at the Axial Flow Turbine Research Facility (AFTRF) using a representative, modern High Pressure Turbine (HPT) stage.  A complete set of aerodynamic instrumentation is designed, assembled and validated for shakedown testing of the AFTRF.  A new aerodynamic probe management system allowing for adaptive gridding in the intraspace and rotor exit frames is designed, built, and validated.  This system, by moving more efficiently, increases the number of measurement locations taken in a two hour run from 336 points to 868.  Using this measurement system, total pressure measurements from a Kiel probe and a Five Hole Probe downstream of the Nozzle Guide Vane (NGV) are shown to agree with each other.  In the rotating frame of the AFTRF-HPT, a new 32 channel electronic pressure measurement system is implemented to measure vane and blade loadings.  Vane loadings have a variation of approximately 1% from run to run and agree well with computational results.  A correction for blade loading in the relative frame of reference is applied and results have a variation of 1% from run to run and agree reasonably well with predictions.  Dynamic measurements of total pressure at the rotor exit, which are phase-locked with the rotor position, allow inspection of the unique flow structures generated by each passage.  The next phase of testing includes varying purge rates of the rim seal cavity, modification of the rim seal cavity, changing the rotor blades to a design to control the tip leakage, and comparing experimental measurements and computational predictions of unsteady structures within the rim seal cavity.  It is found that the \u2018Baseline Blades\u2019 preform less well than the \u2018Tip Vortex Control (TVC) Blades\u2019.  Two tip treatments are tested, smooth and slotted, slotted tip treatments are beneficial to the \u2018Baseline Blades\u2019 and detrimental to the \u2018TVC Blades\u2019 when compared to the smooth tip treatments. Of the two rim seal cavity designs, the modified design used with the \u2018TVC Blades\u2019 with reduced radial clearance reduces the penetration and momentum deficit in the region of the hub endwall passage vortex. Experimentally measured unsteady structures within the rim seal cavity are measured using fast response aerodynamic piezoresistive transducers.  They are then compared to an unsteady transient eight vane, ten blade computations.  A method to extract the speed at which these structures are moving and the number of structures present is given for both the experimental and computational ways.  Within the rim seal cavity 15 unsteady pressure cells moving at 77.5% of the rotor speed are experimentally measured and though the computational methods 14.5 unsteady pressure cells are moving at 81.7% rotor speed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10583], "author_name_tesi": "Town, Jason Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Town", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Horacio Perez Blanco", "Dennis K Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Chair", "Horacio Perez Blanco, Committee Member", "Dennis K Mclaughlin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rim Seal Cavity", "Gas Turbine", "Secondary Flow", "Rotor Blade Tip Treatments", "Rim Seal Cavity Purge"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Team Selection for Integrated Project Delivery", "id": "25192", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11217", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent developments in project delivery have shifted toward integrated approaches that improve the performance of project teams through supportive contractual agreements.

However, some suggest that mesopredators still benefit from contemporary vegetation changes and fragmentation by thriving in disturbed areas. Many worry the versatility of these mesopredators could further threaten their prey species by leading to increased predation in anthropogenically-disturbed areas. This study seasonally sampled predator distributions along land cover gradients in forested, riparian corridors in Appalachia to identify whether landscape modification results in changes in carnivore community structure in the region. The study area consisted of randomly generated sites along streams in central Pennsylvania. I gathered data from camera traps and field surveys to catalogue the spatial ecology of mesopredators. I analyzed these data with landscape metrics to test the hypothesis that as forest contiguity decreases, both the abundance and richness of the predator community increases, possibly adding pressure on vulnerable prey populations. Through the analysis of these habitat metrics and carnivore occurrence data, this study found that carnivore species richness and abundance do generally increase with human disturbance in rural settings. However, this pattern is not due to the behavior of every species as many mesopredators are present across these rural landscapes and exhibit different responses to disturbance. Nevertheless, a few important generalists, namely the canids and raccoons, do show preferences toward more human disturbed areas and thus, are most accountable for this observed pattern.

A key element of effectively engaging cancer patients in their diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship is appropriate and effective communication. The role of the patient navigator has emerged in breast cancer care over the last decade to help integrate information and care processes. A patient navigator is a cancer-care provider who offers support and guidance to breast cancer patients. Having a patient navigator on a cancer-care team may enhance the patient-centered care and significantly improve the effectiveness of communication during cancer treatment. Breast cancer treatment is a preference-sensitive decision because in most cases of breast cancer treatment, there is no clear best clinical choice. Instead, patients apply their personal values and beliefs to select the option they feel is best. Throughout the process of cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship, there are many points of uncertainty. The purpose of the research reported herein was to assess the communicative influence of patient navigators on breast cancer patients\u2019 decision-making process. Specifically, I sought to determine if women who have access to a patient navigator during breast cancer treatment decision-making better manage uncertainty and experience greater patient satisfaction with the overall care experience than women who do not have access to a patient navigator. \nParticipants in an online survey included 124 female breast cancer survivors who had finished active breast cancer treatment within three years of participating. The survey was distributed via convenience snowball sampling. Measures of interest were patient-centered communication, decisional conflict, and patient satisfaction. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 women who were selected via a purposeful random sampling procedure from the sample of online survey participants in the interests of better understanding the nuanced experience of breast cancer patients\u2019 treatment decision-making experience. Factor analysis revealed clusters appropriate to the dimensions of patient-centered communication, decisional conflict, and patient satisfaction. \nIndependent samples t-tests and multiple regression analyses were used to test hypotheses. Several significant results surfaced in comparisons of participants who had a patient navigator on their cancer-care teams and others who did not. Participants who had a patient navigator as part of their cancer-care teams scored significantly higher on patient engagement, individual confirmation, decisional support, and patient satisfaction with the care experience than ones who did not. Patient-centered communication was a predictor of both decisional conflict and patient satisfaction, but only interpersonal sincerity and patient engagement revealed significant relationships when controlling for the other predictor variables. \nFor the qualitative analysis, 19 categories emerged from semi-structured interviews with breast cancer survivors who had finished active treatment during the last three years. Categories included: (a) communication of the diagnosis, (b) uncertainty following diagnosis, (c) communication about treatment options, (d) information-processing of treatment options, (e) treatment decision-making process, (f) decision time pressure, (g) uncertainty during decision-making, (h) information-seeking, (i) decision-makers, (j) decisional support, (k) satisfaction with treatment decisions, (l) emotional support during decision-making, (m) cancer-care team composition and roles, (n) communication with patient navigators, (o) advanced provision of information/avoiding surprises, (p) communication between cancer-care team members, (q) fertility decisions, (r) survivor support, and (s) uncertainty of finishing treatment. Categories were further sub-divided for easier interpretation of quantitative data using qualitative feedback, which is described in detail. \nThe results of this quasi-experimental examination of communication during cancer care and the influence on decisional conflict and patient satisfaction offer insights related to theoretical significance, the importance and the impact of patient navigators as members of a cancer-care team, and the practical implications for breast cancer-related communication. There appears to be a critical influence of nonverbal aspects of communication, namely proxemics, in the structural layout of cancer centers relating to a patient\u2019s ability to manage uncertainty. Implications for breast cancer communication involve a need to create consistency in patient navigation research and practice, improve communication about the timeframe necessary for breast cancer decision-making, and ensure patients receive sufficient social support throughout treatment decision-making.

The MFFST problem consists of locations, tasks that need to be performed at these locations, and workers who must travel between locations in order to perform these tasks.  The amount of time it takes each worker to perform each task is different.  Furthermore,  there is a cost associated with performing each task and the workers' costs differ across both tasks and locations.  A schedule to the MFFST determines the worker that performs each task at each location, and includes the routes for workers through the locations to which they are assigned.  The objective is to identify schedules that provide optimal tradeoffs between the time required to perform the schedule and the cost incurred by performing every task at every location. \n\nThe MFFST problem generalizes well known operations research problems such as the traveling salesman problem and the vehicle routing problem.  It also generalizes flexible shop scheduling, fixed product shop scheduling, and some versions of the MFFST generalize open shops, job shops and flow shops by assuming a precedence structure for tasks at each location.  Fixed product scheduling involves scenarios where the processors move while the product stays in place.  This aligns with the assumptions of the MFFST as the workers move between locations to perform tasks.  This type of scheduling is especially applicable in the assembly of large vehicles, the construction of physical structures, and the performance of operations across geographical areas.\t\n\nThree versions of the MFFST are introduced in this dissertation.  These methods incorporate objectives such as minimizing total cost, minimizing total travel and processing time, and minimizing the makespan of the busiest worker.  Additionally these versions consider open shop and flow shop precedence structures for tasks at each location.  For each of these versions is formulated as a 0-1 MILP, and heuristic methods that are effective and computationally efficient are presented.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8013], "author_name_tesi": "Trail, Casey D", "last_name_ssi": "Trail", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Casey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Ventura", "Jose Ventura", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Paul Griffin", "Shashi Phoha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Ventura, Dissertation Advisor", "Jose Ventura, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiobjective optimization", "scheduling", "integer programming"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Models for Intensive Longitudinal Data: New Models, Statistical Procedures, and Applications", "id": "24818", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10697", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Functional data analysis (FDA) of intensive longitudinal data is becoming increasingly popular in the behavioral sciences to study time-varying processes. This dissertation focuses on integrating two methods which are useful in FDA: dynamical systems models and time-varying coefficient models. Dynamic models provide a more detailed description of a time-varying process than some traditional longitudinal data methods, including effects that characterize the shape, magnitude, and speed of the outcome\u2019s response to a change in inputs, or predictors. Allowing these effects to vary as functions of time uses the intensive nature of the data to describe even more complex change. In the behavioral sciences, a better understanding of the dynamics of a process could be used to inform the design of behavioral interventions. For example, this dissertation was motivated by a study designed to examine the trajectories of change in students\u2019 smoking behavior during the freshman year of college. A better understanding of the trajectory of smoking onset will help inform the development of behavioral interventions to alter this trajectory and prevention smoking. This is important because smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the US. \n\nThe repeated measurements used to describe a dynamical system frequently contain measurement error, and so statistical methods are needed to estimate the parameters of the differential equation model. In this dissertation, we propose a two-step estimation method. The first step uses spline smoothers to smooth the noisy observed data and estimate the derivatives. The second step uses penalized splines to estimate the time-varying effects in the differential equation. We use simulated data to describe the performance of the proposed estimation method. To test hypotheses about the time-varying effects, for example, whether or not an effect is significantly time-varying or determining if a covariate is significant in the model, we propose a generalized likelihood ratio test statistic. We use bootstrap methods and a Monte Carlo simulation study to assess the finite sample properties of the proposed test statistic. The proposed methodology is applied to data from the UpTERN study (Tiffany, et al., 2004). In this empirical example, we examine and test hypotheses about the relations between covariates such as alcohol use and gender and the dynamics of cigarette smoking.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10328], "author_name_tesi": "Trail, Jessica Brooke", "last_name_ssi": "Trail", "middle_name_ssi": "Brooke", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Linda Marie Collins", "Runze Li", "John Fricks", "Donna Coffman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Linda Marie Collins, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "John Fricks, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intensive longitudinal data", "dynamic systems", "time-varying effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Groomed for Power: A Cultural Economy of the Male Body in Nineteenth-Century America", "id": "26509", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11680", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "'Groomed for Power' tells the story of how men\u2019s bodies are made: whose labor produces them, and how meanings are inscribed upon them.

They are highly sensitive to changes in external boundary conditions, such as sea level, sediment supply, and climate. In addition, they have a wide range of internally generated (autogenic) sediment transport processes that control where sediment is deposited or eroded over short to intermediate timescales (up to ~105 years). Example of these autogenic processes include channel avulsion or bifurcation. Because of the highly dynamic nature of fluviodeltaic environments, it is hard to predict how they will respond to future changes in sea level and climate. However, they are critical environments for society, and so efforts have focused on better understanding how they have responded to perturbations in the stratigraphic record in order to better predict the future.  \nThe challenge of directly applying analyses of the stratigraphic record is that the very landscape dynamics that make it hard to predict delta behavior in the future, complicate the preservation and interpretation of past paleoenvironmental signals of all sorts. The autogenic processes in particular cause sediment to be unevenly deposited in both time and space. This means that the stratigraphic record of paleoenvironmental signals is likely to have large amounts of missing time at any given study location within a fluviodeltaic system. Previous work has demonstrated that autogenic processes, and the gaps in the record caused by autogenic processes, can expand, condense, or remove entire portions of paleoenvironmental signals if they occur at timescales less than the longest timescale autogenic processes. In this dissertation, I use a combination of numerical models and field datasets to explore how landscape dynamics control signal preservation and how we can use landscape dynamics to improve the uncertainties related to reconstructing paleoenvironmental signals in dynamic landscapes. \nIn the first project of this dissertation, I investigate how to measure the scale of landscape dynamics using depositional patterns preserved in outcrops that are limited in spatial extent or resolution. To accomplish this I used synthetic stratigraphy from a physical delta experiment to test the sensitivity of a proposed tool to identify the maximum autogenic scale, called the compensation statistic. I also applied this analysis to four field fluviodeltaic datasets. In the second project, I demonstrate the effect of stochastic sedimentation from landscape dynamics on the probability of preservation and the accuracy of reconstructions of paleoenvironmental signals from geochemical paleoenvironmental proxies. To this end, I compiled sedimentation event magnitudes and frequencies from published data from modern and ancient river, delta, and shallow shelf environments. Based on this compilation, I wrote a stochastic sedimentation model that tracked the preservation of an input proxy signal. In the third project, I investigate how autogenic landscape dynamics control the spatiotemporal distribution of erosion and deposition across a fluviodeltaic system using a numerical delta evolution model. I then used multiple models to predict how these landscape dynamics control how many samples are needed to reconstruct complete and accurate reconstructions of paleoenvironmental signals of different durations. Finally, I applied the concepts developed in the first three projects to a case of the preservation of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, a rapid global warming event ~56 Ma, within deltaic and shelf deposits from the Mid-Atlantic. \nOverall, this dissertation demonstrates that rapid paleoenvironmental signals can be reconstructed even in highly dynamic sedimentary system when the system is sampled sufficiently to overcome the combined effects of landscape dynamics. Additionally, my analyses demonstrate that under-sampled fluviodeltaic systems are highly likely to significantly bias reconstructions of the original signal. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16027], "author_name_tesi": "Trampush, Sheila Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Trampush", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Sheila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek", "Elizabeth Ann Hajek", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Lee Kump", "Benjamin Adam Shaby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Committee Chair", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Benjamin Adam Shaby, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stratigraphy", "geology", "Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum", "autogenic sedimentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Global Differences in Building Enclosures", "id": "18094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Successful design and construction of building enclosures on foreign projects presents a challenge for those who are new to international business.

For patients with advanced stage disease, treatments are limited and outcomes poor.  Development of therapies that target key pathways are needed such as targeting the PI3k/Akt and Map kinase pathways.  It was found that targeting these pathways in combination, with sorafenib and nanoliposomal ceramide, results in greater melanoma and breast tumor inhibition than targeting only one pathway. In vivo, a ~30% increase in tumor inhibition compared to sorafenib treatment alone and a ~58% reduction in tumor size compared to nanoliposomal ceramide monotherapy occurred by doubling apoptosis rates with negligible systemic toxicity.  This was followed by utilization of an siRNA-based approach to further evaluate the potential of targeting these pathways in combination.  siRNA-based therapies have great potential for use in combination therapies but appropriate targets and effective delivery systems are required.  B-Raf is mutated in ~60% of melanomas leading to constitutive activation of the Map kinase pathway making it an attractive target for siRNA therapy. Therefore, a novel liposome formulation was designed that efficiently loaded and delivered mutant V600EB-Raf siRNA to melanoma cells. Systemic administration of siMutB-Raf-liposomal complexes led to a ~ 25% reduction in tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of melanoma.  Additionally, localized topical administration of siMutB-Raf-liposomal complex in conjunction with ultrasound treatment resulted in tumor reduction in both a three-dimensional skin model and in mice with melanoma xenografts.  Furthermore, adding siRNA to Akt3 in a liposomal formulation to the topically applied siMutB-Raf-liposomal complex doubled tumor inhibition to 60%.  These studies demonstrate the potential utility of targeting multiple cancer pathways both by pharmacological means and via siRNA.  Designing a novel liposome formulation to encapsulate siRNAs advanced the use of siRNA as a therapeutic in melanoma.  Furthermore, this liposomal siRNA complex can be modified in the future to improve the results seen here.  These studies demonstrate the use of siMutB-Raf-liposomal complexes alone or in combination with siAkt3-liposomal complexes in the treatment of melanoma.  Additionally the use of siRNA as a topical agent was advanced by using ultrasound to transiently permeabilize the skin followed by addition of siRNA liposomal complexes.  Thus, targeting the PI3k/Akt pathway in conjunction with the Map kinase pathway is potentially useful for targeting melanoma and breast cancer.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3977], "author_name_tesi": "Tran, Melissa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Tran", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Laura Carrel", "Jiyue Zhu", "Thomas Loughran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Chair", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member", "Thomas Loughran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["siRNA", "liposomes", "melanoma", "ultrasound"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF HIGH PRESSURE JET PROCESSING ON THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND FOAMING PROPERTIES OF WHOLE MILK AND ITS IMPACT ON COCOA STABILITY IN CHOCOLATE MILK", "id": "13823mmt5362", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "13823", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effects of various types of high pressure processing on dairy foods have shown to dissociate casein micelles, denature whey protein, and change the appearance and rheological properties of milk. Studies have also investigated the use of high pressure processed milk in technological applications such as rennet coagulation in cheese making and acid coagulation. A novel high pressure processing technique using waterjet technology called high pressure jet (HPJ) is currently being investigated for use in the food industry. Few studies have been conducted on the effects of HPJ technology on dairy foods. The present study investigated the physicochemical and foaming properties of homogenized pasteurized whole milk processed at pressures from 0 to 500 MPa using high pressure jet processing. \t\n\tApparent particle size showcased a monomodal distribution at 0 and 125 MPa and a bimodal distribution at 250 to 500 MPa. Increase in apparent particle size was due to dissociated casein micelles subjected to pressures \u2265250 MPa releasing surface active caseins interacting with fat, resulting in increase in viscosity and foamability. Although foamability increased with increasing pressure, the foam stability was limited to pressures 250-500 MPa. Milk processed at 375 MPa showcased the highest viscosity, whereas viscosity of milk samples processed at 500 MPa decreased, but was still significantly higher than the control. Ultracentrifugation of samples into three milk fractions (cream, whey, casein) and subsequent fat and protein analysis on the three fractions, indicated the migration of fat and protein into the \u201ccasein\u201d fraction with increasing pressure. This suggests increased interactions between casein and fat, creating stable casein-fat aggregates induced by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions due to the level of shear, cavitation, and turbulence caused by high pressure.    \n\tUtilization of HPJ-modified casein micelles in chocolate skim milk was also investigated. Standard chocolate milk formulations with skim milk, cocoa powder, sugar, and no stabilizers were heat treated and processed with HPJ processing at 0 to 500 MPa (in 125 MPa increments). The stability of cocoa was observed over a 14 day shelf life and compared to chocolate skim milk formulations containing \u03ba-carrageenan and corn starch. As expected, chocolate skim milk formulation containing \u03ba-carrageenan was 100% stable after 14 days. Increase in stability was observed with increasing pressure with the most stable sample processed at 500 MPa (ca. 70%).  \t\n\tApparent viscosity of HPJ-processed samples increased with increasing pressure showcasing shear thinning properties at pressures \u2265250 MPa. Higher stability of HPJ-processed chocolate skim milk at 500 MPa compared to chocolate milk to corn starch with similar apparent viscosity (ca. 5 mPa s measured at \u03b3\u0307 = 50 1/s) indicates the mechanism behind increased stabilization of cocoa by HPJ-processing is more complex than increase in viscosity. Furthermore, HPJ-processing of cocoa and water dispersions was found to decrease the particle size of cocoa compared to conventional homogenization (14 MPa), reducing sedimentation rate due to decreased particle density. The results from this study indicate that structure-function changes of casein micelles and cocoa particles HPJ-processed at >375 MPa increased cocoa stability in chocolate skim milk. \n\tA second study with chocolate skim milk was conducted to determine the effect of micellar casein concentration (1%, 2%, or 4%) and HPJ-processing at 0-500 MPa on the stability of cocoa particles. Formulations with 4% added micellar casein processed at 375 and 500 MPa was 100% stable over 14 days stored at 4\u00b0C. Apparent viscosity of HPJ-processed samples at 500 MPa increased with micellar casein concentration, exhibiting the strongest shear thinning behavior with 4% micellar casein. Increase of cocoa stability in HPJ-processed chocolate milk at 375 MPa and 500 MPa with increased micellar casein content indicates possible aggregation and clustering of casein micelles, corresponding to increase in casein-casein and casein-cocoa interactions. Modification of casein micelles through HPJ-processing provides new functionalities to enhance the dispersion stability of dairy and non-dairy beverages without the use of added stabilizers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14194], "author_name_tesi": "Tran, Michelle ", "last_name_ssi": "Tran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Federico M.

Sustainable agriculture is committed to the ?triple-bottom-line? of social, economic and environmental justice, in which social equality, economic profitability and environmental soundness are emphasized. These discourses of justice, however, are not always translated into the practices of organizations committed to sustainability, according to some critics. This dissertation seeks to investigate how the sustainable agriculture social movement in Pennsylvania articulates these discourses and translates them into practice. The framework I use for this analysis includes a network ontology, which emphasizes social change through connection. I studied three groups (or networks) in Pennsylvania: a marketing cooperative, a women?s group and a farm based education program. The methods for the analysis are primarily qualitative, but include visualizing and analyzing social networks and political agency through the use of geographic visualization technologies. \n\nThe research concludes that sustainable agriculture in Pennsylvania is committed to social change and the triple-bottom-line, but these ideals are translated rather imperfectly into the practices of individuals and groups. Organic agriculture as a technical practice of sustainable agriculture is promoted as a way to obtain price premiums for farmers. Organic agriculture supports environmentally friendly practices, and helps farmers stay in business, but reproduces some of the social injustices of conventional agriculture, such as the exploitation of labor. Women in conventional agriculture are traditionally marginalized from spaces of knowledge and power, because they are not seen as ?real? farmers. Efforts to provide education and agency to women in sustainable agriculture also fall prey to identity politics based on who qualifies as a farmer. Farm-based education programs designed to spread knowledge about environmentally friendly farming practices also translate well into productivist models when an emphasis is on technical practices, rather than on community and holistic farm management. In summary, the networks facilitate the pursuit of justice, but confront obstacles regarding ?who belongs,? the scale of the organization, and the length of the network.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [198], "author_name_tesi": "Trauger, Amy Kathryn", "last_name_ssi": "Trauger", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Wright", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Cynthia Ann Brewer", "James Mc Carthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Wright, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Committee Chair", "James Mc Carthy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sustainable agriculture", "social justice", "networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "VOLUNTEERISM AT URBAN PARK AND RECREATION AGENCIES:  EXAMINING THE ROLE OF VOLUNTEERS\u2019 SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, MOTIVATIONS, ORGANIZATIONAL IDENTITY, AND SATISFACTION ON VOLUNTEER PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES \n", "id": "12252", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4648", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Public park and recreation agencies have a history of using volunteers to provide leisure services to their constituencies.  These agencies are facing ever-growing budget cuts and are being forced to rely on volunteers to maintain facilities and offer programs.  As park and recreation agencies are relying more on volunteers to provide services, they are attempting to reach out to socio-demographically diverse constituents. Recruiting and retaining a diverse volunteer work force may be the most realistic way for public agencies to keep up with these sociodemographic changes.  \n\nBudget reductions are influencing volunteer management and oversight in park and recreation agencies.  As these agencies are losing staff, they are relying more on volunteer leaders to direct and organize on the ground efforts.  Park and recreation agencies, not only need to recruit and retain a diverse volunteer labor force, but they also need to recruit and retain volunteer leaders.  Park and recreation volunteer managers and researchers need to better understand their current sociodemographic diversity and leadership in order to retain and possibly recruit new volunteers and leaders.  \n\nUsing the conceptual framework of the Volunteer Process Model \n(VPM) this study examines the sociodemographic differences that exist between park and recreation volunteers in a large urban park and recreation department.  Further, it examines differences that exist between volunteer leaders and non-leaders.  Finally, this study examined the combined influence of all the stages of the VPM on volunteer consequences.  \n\nTo examine these differences, data was collected from Philadelphia Department of Parks and Recreation volunteer leaders and general volunteers.  Using both a mail survey and email online survey 182 volunteer leaders and 149 non-leaders completed a questionnaire.  The mail survey had a response rate of 30.5%, while the online survey had a response rate of 15.3%.  Demographically, respondents were female (57%), white (86%), had 4-year college degrees or more (72%), on average were 53 years old, and did not have children under the age of 18 living their homes (79%).  On average, respondents had volunteered for their respective volunteer organizations for 9.9 years and spent 12.8 hours per month volunteering.  Most respondents volunteered for at least one other volunteer organization (79%).\nVolunteers from different sociodemographic backgrounds were motivated, experienced and had significantly different levels of involvement in their volunteer efforts.  Females, people of color, people with children living in their homes and people with less than a 4-year college degree had the highest levels of volunteer involvement and were more likely to be volunteer group leaders.  This is contrary to previous research, which suggests that volunteer leaders are more likely to be well-educated, white, males.  \n\nWhen examining the combined effect of the VPM on leaders and non-leaders, the VPM explained a significant amount of the variance for both groups.  For leaders, the VPM explained less of the variance in LOI (17%), however, it did explain 20% of the variance in organizational identity (OID).  For non-leaders the experiences, parental status, and gender explained 32% of the variance in LOI.  Female and parents had higher levels of LOI than males and people without children when accounting for all other antecedents, experiences, and proximal consequences.  \n\nThese results have both managerial and conceptual implications.  For leaders and non-leaders being satisfied with participation efficacy was very important.  Volunteers with the highest level of involvement not only feel that they are needed, but they then feel satisfied that they are making a valuable contribution.  Managers strive to provide situations where volunteers can make a notable difference, and in cases where this is not possible they should encourage and acknowledge the volunteer efforts.  \nVolunteer leaders develop a strong sense of identity with the organizations that they lead.  They tend to view the organizations successes and failures as their own.  This can be a very positive consequence for volunteer managers.  The more leaders identify with their organizations the higher their level of involvement. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4614], "author_name_tesi": "Trauntvein, Nate ", "last_name_ssi": "Trauntvein", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nate", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Alan R Graefe", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Patreese Donette Ingram"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Chair", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Patreese Donette Ingram, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Leaders and Non-leaders", "Park and Recreation", "Volunteer", "Process Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Inter-rifting and Inter-seismic Strain Accumulation in a Propagating Ridge System: A Study From South Iceland", "id": "16076", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7969", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a slow spreading (~19 mm/yr) mid-ocean ridge boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates, is exposed subaerially in Iceland as a result of ridge-hotspot interaction.

In this study we investigate how strain is partitioned between the WVZ and EVZ, and whether the WVZ is active and accumulating strain. We also test how strain is accumulating along fissure swarms within the EVZ (i.e., is strain accumulation localized to one fissure swarm, or are multiple systems active). We use GPS data and elastic block models using the program DEFNODE to investigate these issues. GPS data are processed using the GIPSY-OASIS II software, and have been truncated to the 2000.5-2011 time period to avoid co-seismic displacement from the two June 2000 South Iceland Seismic Zone earthquakes. We also truncate the time series to the beginning of 2010 for sites within 20 km of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull to eliminate deformation associated with the March 2010 eruption. We correct for co-seismic displacement from the two May 28, 2008 SISZ earthquakes, inflation at Hekla volcano and the horizontal component of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). \nOur best-fit model for inter-rifting and inter-seismic elastic strain accumulation suggests a rate of 3.3 + 1.1 mm/yr for the WVZ and 15.7 + 1.1 mm/yr for the EVZ. The best-fit model predicts the EVZ to be located between Veidivotn and Lakag\u00edgar in an area of no Holocene volcanic activity. Geologic and geophysical evidence in the form of historical seismic swarms, central volcano inflation and rifting events have been documented in the Hengill system (southern WVZ), along with ongoing geothermal activity. We therefore suggest the WVZ is only active at Hengill and its associated fissure swarm and is failing in the north.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7917], "author_name_tesi": "Travis, Matthew Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Travis", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Christopher Lafemina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Christopher Lafemina, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mid-Atlantic Ridge", "Iceland", "Strain Accumulation", "Propagating Ridge"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Characterizing the Impact if Rigidity on the Security of Cellular Telecommunications Networks\n\n", "id": "8184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4885", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cellular telecommunications networks are the largest, most widely used digital systems ever constructed.

Three types of vibration control exist to dissipate these effects: passive control, semi-active control, and active control. Historically, rigid pitch links have been used on rotorcraft, however, researchers have been exploring alternatives to conventional rigid pitch links as a means to reduce vibrations. One viable passive vibration reduction device is the fluidic pitch link. Replacing rigid pitch links on rotorcraft with fluidic pitch links provides a method for vibratory control. At high frequencies, the pitch link impedance can be tuned to change the blade pitching response to higher harmonic loads. Although all have not been demonstrated simultaneously, fluidic pitch links have been shown to reduce rotor power and all six hub forces and moments. While reduced vibrations have been observed upon substitution of rigid pitch links for fluidic pitch links, the impact of fluidic pitch links on stability has not yet been examined. As such, this investigation explores the aeroelastic stability of a helicopter with fluidic pitch links. \n\nEach rotor is articulated and is modeled by rigid pitch and rigid flap degrees of freedom. Quasi-steady aerodynamics are used for the lift and moment terms in the aeroelastic model. The control system stiffness is modeled as an axial spring. The fluidic pitch links have two degrees of freedom: axial displacement of the piston, which is directly related to pitch, and volume of fluid entering the inertia track. A positive impact on aeroelastic stability from several fluidic pitch link designs is demonstrated for hover. The positive stability margins found for the fluidic pitch links in hover are marginally affected by the periodic terms that appear in forward flight. The fluidic pitch links are shown to help stabilize the pitch mode and enable use of substantially larger aft center of gravity offsets in rotor design. \n\nTo test the fluidic pitch link for model verification purposes, the model for a double pumper fluidic pitch link was derived. This is a more viable and popular choice than the single pumper design used previously due to greater safety and reduced risk of cavitation. A prototype fluidic pitch link was designed, built, and tested at LORD Corporation. Displacement, load, and pressure were recorded during testing. Frequency and time response results were compared between simulation and experiment to validate the model. Three different fluid circuits were used, and the model accurately predicted performance for each of them with the exception of inaccuracy at low frequency due, in part, to the frequency dependence of the elastomer. An additional fourth circuit was tested that included a needle valve. The model did not accurately predict results across the entire range of valve positions, but the model was able to accurately match the dynamic stiffness amplitude using empirical parameters from a parameter study.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15586], "author_name_tesi": "Treacy, Shawn Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Treacy", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Shawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Christopher Rahn", "Edward Smith", "Reuben H Kraft", "Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Edward Smith, Committee Member", "Reuben H Kraft, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluidic pitch link", "FPL", "stability", "articulated", "helicopter", "experiment", "test", "rotor"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SUPPORTING BOMBUS AND OTHER BEES IN CUCURBITA AGROECOSYSTEMS", "id": "14745ezt5142", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The decline of pollinators, in particular bees, has been an extensively researched and discussed topic in the last few decades. This decline was noted in both honey bees and native bee species, with concern increasing for some bumble bee species. A myriad of stressors have been implicated in this decline, but pathogens, pesticides, parasites and loss of habitat resulting in poor nutrition, canvas a majority of suspected and interacting factors. Agricultural land intensification houses a number of these stressors, often resulting in both increased likelihood to pesticide exposure and a loss of access to diverse assemblages of floral resources. Paradoxically, agriculture can also function to provide a large pulse of the floral resources that bees depend on. In this thesis I target this issue by focusing on a commonly found agroecosystem within the Mid-Atlantic region, pumpkin, or Cucurbita pepo, and examine (1) How cover-cropping can be used as a form of floral provisioning to provide additional resources for generalist pollinators (2) The quality of the floral resources provided within these floral provisionings, and (3) Effects of insecticide usage on both Cucurbita pepo and its generalist pollinators.\nCucurbita pepo presents a challenging system to work with due to its rotational nature, which creates limitations on the type of floral provisioning that can be used. I examined how a dual-flowering planting (fall-flowering and spring-flowering) using mixtures of common cover-crop species could fit into this system while supporting relevant pollinators. I also observed how various seeding rates affected the floral density of the planting, and how that effect persisted into the behavior of the pollinators. I found that seeding rate did not significantly affect either the floral density, or the behavior of the pollinators, suggesting that growers have flexibility in the seeding rate they use.\n \tI then focused on the quality of the floral resources provided in these plantings, e.g., the pollen, to observe how Bombus impatiens fed on this pollen would respond. I approached this by using no-choice bioassays using queenless B. impatiens microcolonies and pollen from pumpkin, two common cover crop species from two plant families commonly visited by Bombus, a multifloral diet, and an artificial honey bee diet. After seven days, I examined the size of their ovaries, their change in weight, and their waxing behavior to gauge their response. I confirmed that adults feed on pollen, and found that pollen quality had a significant impact on the size of their ovaries, as well as ability to produce wax.\n       \tLastly I examined the Cucurbita pepo system itself by looking at systemic insecticide usage and possible risks of exposure for Bombus and Apis mellifera. I examined how different methods of neonicotinoid treatment effects the floral display within Cucurbita pepo, and how this persisted into the foraging behavior of the observed pollinators. Looking at plant response, I found that the amount of insecticide applied had a significant effect on the number of flowers produced by the plant. Apis mellifera and Bombus demonstrated alternative preference to treatments, with treatment having a significant effect on foraging behavior of Apis mellifera but not Bombus. \n       \tBy approaching pollinator conservation in an agroecosystem using an integrative approach, I aimed to emphasize the importance of considering all components of an agroecosystem. Although this research was conducted within the Mid-Atlantic, the ideas and concepts can be considered within the context of other systems and regions. These studies and findings in this thesis were meant to improve our understanding and ability to support pollinators through threat mitigation and a more targeted approach to floral provisioning\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15753], "author_name_tesi": "Treanore, Erin D", "last_name_ssi": "Treanore", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelby Fleischer", "Christina M Grozinger", "Heather M Hines"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelby Fleischer, Thesis Advisor", "Christina M Grozinger, Committee Member", "Heather M Hines, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cucurbita pepo", "Bombus", "Pollinators", "Nutritional Ecology", "Pollen", "Neonicotinoids", "Cover Cropping", "Habitat Enhancements", "Pollen Nutrition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Exercise and Alcohol Dependence\n", "id": "10620", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2821", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between heavy alcohol use, including alcohol dependence, and the frequency of exercise among a convenience sample of college students at the Pennsylvania State University.

Author disambiguation also enables better bibliometric analysis by allowing a more accurate counting and grouping of publications and citations. While many disambiguation algorithms have been proposed, the most successful ones are those that apply machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and SVMs, to learn the domain specific rules. While SVM-based disambiguation methods have been shown to work well, they suffer from typical drawback of SVMs such as long-training time and arbitrary kernel functions.\n\nIn this thesis, we propose a comprehensive set of similarity profile features to assist in author disambiguation and a novel pair-wise author disambiguation algorithm based on random forests, an ensemble classifier based on decision trees.

Compared with SVMs, the random forest model is substantially faster to train and requires less parameter tuning to achieve good performance.

Through an analysis of the lives, work, and reception of four \u201cpoetesses\u201d publishing between approximately 1820 and 1860, I show how the concept of the poetess was shaped both by external critical forces and by the efforts of the poets who may have identified with that role. Felicia Hemans, Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L.E.L.), Alfred Tennyson, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning each adapt the figure of the poetess as a representation of their sentimental poetic project. Hemans conceived of this figure as a bard charged with the preservation of the feminine experiences of home and loss. Landon saw the poetess as a woman destroyed by the all-consuming poetic gift that she possesses and cannot live without. Tennyson responded to Hemans\u2019s and Landon\u2019s concepts of the poetess and then constructed for himself an identity as a male poetess, a man who adopts a feminine voice and subject position in his artistic endeavors. Finally, Barrett Browning reimagined the poetess as a profoundly modern figure whose primary role was to lend her voice and her power to inspiring social change.\n\nThe argument presented here reclaims aesthetic femininity, characterized by sentimental, domestic, and woman-centered poetics, as a crucial site of much-needed feminist analysis, while rejecting the continuing marginalization of female poets by demonstrating their participation in an ongoing literary discourse with their male peers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2891], "author_name_tesi": "Treftz, Jill Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Treftz", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jill", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicholas A Joukovsky", "Nicholas A Joukovsky", "Paul Youngquist", "Rachel Teukolsky", "Emily Harrington", "John Philip Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicholas A Joukovsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Nicholas A Joukovsky, Committee Chair", "Paul Youngquist, Committee Member", "Rachel Teukolsky, Committee Member", "Emily Harrington, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["poetess", "sentimental poetess", "alfred tennyson", "elizabeth barrett browning", "felicia hemans", "letitia elizabeth landon"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "TIME DEPENDENT DEFORMATION OF THIN FILM PLATINUM DURING NANOINDENTATION TESTING\n\n", "id": "9144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "236", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous nanoindentation studies of thin film platinum have reported elastic moduli values that are approximately 10 to 25 percent lower than the expected polycrystalline aggregate values.  However, no explanation of these low moduli values was given.  This study attempts to explore the cause of the low moduli values and further evaluate thin film platinum properties.  Instrument artifact, spatial variation, and time-dependency were examined as possible explanation of the low moduli values.  Instrument artifacts such as pile-up, machine compliance, residual stresses, surface roughness, and delamination and/or microcracking were eliminated as potential sources of the low moduli values.  After correction for both pile-up and machine compliance, the platinum film in this study was found to have a reduced modulus approximately 10 percent lower than that expected from anisotropic elasticity and indentation theories.  The film did show spatial variation in mechanical properties, with one region having a modulus that was approximately five percent higher than the theoretical prediction.  Additionally, the two different regions showed differing sensitivity to loading and unloading rate during indentation testing.  These two combined facts suggest that the material has a spatial variation of mechanical properties, which could be caused by surface chemistry or morphology, localized processing effects, or discohered platinum from the silicon substrate.  In the low moduli regions, the film exhibited a time dependent behavior, likely due to anelasticity, or reversible linear viscoelasticity.  The loading rate dependency of the load-displacement curves and the independency of the residual indentation depth support this theory.  Ultimately, the reported low moduli values previously reported in the literature and in this study are likely due to spatial variation and an anelastic response of thin film platinum, and are not caused by instrument artifact.\nDuring the testing of thin film platinum, it was discovered that several indentation tests showed anomalous behavior at very slow loading rates that could not be explained in conjunction with the other, normal results.  The abnormal tests had bulging loading and unloading curves, causing the material to appear inconsistently stiff during loading and soft during unloading.  When the system displacement drift was examined, it was found to be an important factor in the quality of slow loading rate, long duration test data.  Drift experiments showed that the drift rate during a test is non-constant, uncorrectable, and may cause large uncertainties and errors in the values derived from long duration tests.  The accumulated drift as a percentage of maximum indentation depth proved to be a good criterion for identifying unreliable data.  When the accumulated drift percentage was larger than 100 percent, the elastic moduli values were non-physical due to gross abnormalities in the force-displacement curves.  Therefore, tests with accumulated drift percentages larger than 100 percent should be discarded since they are likely to cause error and uncertainty in indentation test data.  Additionally, errors in displacement and subsequently calculated values due to non-constant drift should be reported, particularly in long test times.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [234], "author_name_tesi": "Tremper, Amber Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Tremper", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Amber", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Christopher Muhlstein", "Christopher Muhlstein", "Lawrence Friedman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor", "Lawrence Friedman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoindentation", "platinum"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effects of Nanoscale Coatings on Reliability of MEMS Ohmic Contact Switches", "id": "17675", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis examines how the electrical and mechanical behavior of Au thin films is altered by the presence of ultra-thin metallic coatings. To examine the mechanical behavior, nanoindentation, nano-scratch, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) testing was performed. The electrical behavior was evaluated through Kelvin probe contact resistance measurements.\nThis thesis shows that ultra-thin, hard, ductile coatings on a softer, ductile underlying layer (such as Ru or Pt on Au) had a significant effect on mechanical behavior of the system, and can be tailored to control the deformation resistance of the thin film system. Despite Ru and Pt having a higher hardness and plane strain modulus than Au, the Ru and Pt coatings decreased both the hardness and plane strain modulus of the layered system when the indentation depth was on the order of the coating thickness. Alternately, when the indentation depth was several times the coating thickness, the ductile, plastically hard, elastically stiff layer significantly hardened the contact response. These results correlate well with membrane stress theoretical predictions, and demonstrate that membrane theory can be applied even when the ratio of indentation depth, h, to coating thickness, t, is very large (h/t<10). The transition from film-substrate models to membrane models occurs when the indent penetration depth to coating thickness ratio is less than ~0.5.\nWhen the electrical behavior of the Ru-coated Au films was examined, it was found that all the measured resistances of the Au-only film and Ru-coated systems were several orders of magnitude larger than those predicted by Holm\u2019s law, but were still in good\niii\niv agreement with previously reported values in the literature. Previous studies attributed the\nhigh contact resistances to a variety of causes, including the buildup of an insulating contamination layer. This thesis determined the cause of the deviations to be large sheet resistance contributions to the total measured resistance. Further, studies on aged samples (with thicker contamination layers) conclusively showed that, while contamination increases the contact resistance, it also increases the dependence on force. This thesis also details that the relative contribution of contact resistance to the total measured resistance can be maximized by decreasing the probe spacing and tip radius.\nAFM testing of the layered systems showed that the coated samples had larger predicted plane strain moduli than the Au sample, in contrast to the nanoindentation testing. Thus, when the contact depth was kept sufficiently small, the contact stiffness increased as predicted by substrate models. When the contact depth was on the order of the coating thickness, the contact stiffness actually decreased. Additionally, the force- separation plots showed that the Ru and Pt surfaces either accumulated large amounts of contamination or were less susceptible to being wiped clean than the Au film. Further, scratch testing of the Au film and Ru and Pt coatings show that the hard surface coatings reduce material removal and contact wear.\nUltra-thin Ru and Pt surface coatings on Au films are shown to be improved material systems for ohmic contact switches.

A third specimen (tested by others) represented the control specimen reinforced with conventional Grade-60 bars. All three specimens were designed to have similar flexural strengths (with nearly identical \u03c1g fy) and were subjected to the same loading protocol consisting of reversed-cyclic displacements of increasing amplitude. The applied axial load remained constant throughout the loading protocol. The test specimens included variation in the volume fraction of hooked steel fibers, 0% for reinforced concrete (RC) and 1.5% for high-performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC); and the spacing of the transverse hoops, d/4 for RC and d/2 for HPFRC. The nominal concrete strength was 6000 psi for all specimens.\nAll of the tested columns completed the cyclic loading protocol, which targeted a maximum drift ratio of 5%. The test data indicate that, for RC and HPFRC columns, replacing conventional Grade-60 longitudinal reinforcement with reduced amounts of Grade-97 steel bars attained the target flexural strength and deformation capacity. The calculated nominal and probable moments, using conventional assumptions in Strength Design, were in reasonable agreement with the measured values.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8957], "author_name_tesi": "Tretiakova, Ksenia K", "last_name_ssi": "Tretiakova", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Ksenia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Andres Lepage"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Andres Lepage, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["high", "strength", "concrete", "column", "columns", "steel", "SAS 670", "grade-97", "cyclic", "seismic", "hpfrc", "fibers", "high performance fiber reinforced"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effect of Atipamezole on the Antinociceptive Properties of Butorphanol and Buprenorphine Following Ketamine and Dexmedetomidine Anesthesia in C57BL/6J Mice", "id": "17397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8565", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine is often used for anesthesia of rats and mice in laboratory research. As an \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist, the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine can be reversed by administration of an \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist, such as atipamezole, to speed anesthetic recovery. Opioids are often administered postoperatively for their potent analgesic effects. A previous study has shown that atipamezole may antagonize the antinociceptive effects of opioids in rats, but literature is lacking regarding the effects of atipamezole on butorphanol and buprenorphine in mice. If the antinociceptive effects of opioid analgesics are inadvertently attenuated by atipamezole, poor postoperative analgesia could have a significant impact on animal welfare, regulatory compliance and research results. A six-part study was designed to investigate the effects of atipamezole administered before butorphanol or buprenorphine, on tail-flick latency and also following ketamine-dexmedetomidine anesthesia in female C57BL/6J mice. Nociception was evaluated using the tail-flick test at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 minutes following drug treatment. Atipamezole alone had no significant effect on tail-flick latency and no significant effect on the antinociceptive properties of butorphanol or buprenorphine in mice. Following ketamine-dexmedetomidine anesthesia, there were no significant differences in tail-flick latency values between the atipamezole and atipamezole plus butorphanol groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in tail-flick latencies between the atipamezole and atipamezole plus buprenorphine groups following anesthesia, except at 90 and 150 minutes after treatment. These results suggest that the analgesic effects of butorphanol and buprenorphine are not affected by the reversal agent, atipamezole. However, buprenorphine should be given prior to surgery to provide adequate postoperative analgesia in C57BL/6J mice.

Thus, educational disparities not only prevent vulnerable populations from gaining access to a better life but also hinder a nation\u2019s development. Theoretically, economic growth provides more resources for education. However, initial observations in many developing countries show that economic growth does not bring the same educational benefits to everyone. Vietnam offers an interesting context in which to study ethnic educational disparities in a developing country transforming from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy. After socioeconomic transformations, Vietnam has achieved significant progress, including economic and educational growth. However, educational disparities, especially in upper-secondary education, not only persist but have increased. Ethnic minority students continue to lag behind in upper-secondary school, despite the government\u2019s significant efforts to promote their education. Thus, understanding of ethnic educational disparities can yield recommendations for policymakers, parents, and educators regarding how to promote ethnic minorities\u2019 educational success and assist in Vietnam\u2019s broader socioeconomic development.\n\tTo understand ethnic disparities in upper-secondary education in Vietnam over the last 20 years since the socioeconomic transformations, my dissertation comprises two studies. In \u201cEthnic Disparities in Education after Vietnam\u2019s Socioeconomic Transformations: Family Background and Residential Differences,\u201d I used data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys (9 waves of data collected between 1992 and 2014) to examine factors contributing to increases in ethnic educational disparities at the upper-secondary level. My findings confirmed that the ethnic disparities in three outcomes \u2014 upper-secondary enrollment, attendance, and completion \u2014 continue increasing. While residential differences slightly contributed to these disparities, family background differences, especially parental education and the rise in ethnic-based income inequality at the household level, explained these ethnic-based education disparities. In addition, I found that while household income contributions to the ethnic educational disparities tended to decrease, the role of parental education with respect to the ethnic-based educational disparities increased. These findings suggest important implications to policymakers, educators, and parents in promoting education among disadvantaged populations, especially ethnic minorities in Vietnam.\n\tDespite a number of challenges, some ethnic minority youths do enroll in and complete their upper-secondary education. Therefore, understanding how some ethnic minority students manage to overcome barriers and succeed educationally can also provide important insights regarding the means that policymakers, educators, and parents can pursue in order to address such educational disparities. With this aim, in my second study, \u201cEthnic Minority Educational Success: Understanding Accomplishments in Challenging Settings,\u201d I used a mixed-methods approach and explored data from the Families and Communities in Transition (FACT) study to examine risk and protective or supportive factors pertaining to upper-secondary education among youth belonging to the Thai ethnic group, the second-largest ethnic minority group in Vietnam. The study found that early marriage, poverty, low-educated parents, low parental engagement in the child's education, school distance, being bullied or teased, and being encouraged by friends to drop out were challenges to ethnic minorities\u2019 upper-secondary school enrollment and retention. More importantly, the study provided evidence that holding a positive attitude toward schooling oneself and enjoying effective support from parents, relatives, and peers (both in and out of school) can prevent ethnic minority students from dropping out of school and promote their educational success.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16570], "author_name_tesi": "Trieu, Quang Thanh", "last_name_ssi": "Trieu", "middle_name_ssi": "Thanh", "first_name_ssi": "Quang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody", "Scott David Gest", "Leif Jensen", "David Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Dissertation Advisor", "Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Committee Chair", "Scott David Gest, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "David Post, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Educational Disparities", "Family Background", "Socioeconomic Transformations", "Education Resilience", "Vietnam", "Ethnic Minorities"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Self-Assembly of Two-Dimensional Non-Spherical Particles: A Monte Carlo Simulation Study", "id": "10328", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1330", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For applications in device fabrication, such as sensors or nanoelectronics, it is often\ndesirable to utilize the self-assembly behavior of particles in two dimensions to\nproduce the structures.

The work presented in this\ndissertation contributes to the understanding necessary to achieve self-assembled\nstructures using non-spherical particles in two dimensions. Non-spherical particle\ngeometries result in phases that symmetric particles, such as disks or spheres, do\nnot exhibit. Rectangles, spherocylinders, ellipses, cubes, and squares have the ability\nto produce diverse structures depending on their aspect ratio, concentration,\nand subtle differences in their geometry.

In all cases, the\nrectangles align with their long axis parallel to the confining wall. Systems of rectangles\nthat are in the nematic phase in the bulk exhibit layering next to the wall when confined.

In this analysis, I develop a series of logistic regression models using data from the 2000 General Social Survey to evaluate the plausibility of the process I hypothesize.

Being a college student facilitates both protesting and voting, but much more early in life than later. Being not married affects protesting but not voting. Additionally, I find that people follow different trajectories in the lifecourse in terms of how they choose to protest and vote, and that, while biographical availability has an attenuated effect on those who protested when young and continued protesting, it does not have an effect on those who start protesting later in life. Other biographical factors such as, such as union membership and church affiliation, play more of a role in precipitating protest participation for these \u201clate bloomers\u201d.

Numerous perceptions were seen as essential in furthering the understanding of observations and analysis of power in organizations during transformations. \nThe study used critical organizational theory with a postmodern lens as its framework to view power, allowing for a holistic examination of power and acknowledging that power in an organization comes in multiple types and stems from multiple sources. Power types and sources play a significant role in both the culture of the organization and the potential limitations on learning accessible to workers and ultimate transformation of the organization. This being said, in order to enhance the potential for organizational transformation cultural characteristics such as: increased self-sufficiency, wide communication, freedom of choice, creating a learning environment, and a more democratic distribution of power were considered.\n The study utilized a case study methodology to gather data.

Myosins utilize the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to perform mechanical work via a cyclic interaction with actin filaments. Intricate allosteric pathways operate within the myosin molecule which leads to the coupling of different sub-domains and an efficient generation of force. The three main regions involved in this active communication are the nucleotide and actin-binding regions which are both coupled to the force-generating lever arm region. The lever arm undergoes a reversible movement defined by the recovery stroke and the powerstroke which eventually leads to the generation of force. However, the kinetic and structural details of this mechanism of force generation remain elusive. At an interface of biochemistry and biophysics, this study utilizes novel fluorophore labeling strategies combined with fluorescence spectroscopy and stopped-flow kinetics to answer these questions. Myosin V (MV) is used as a model to uncover the structural changes associated with the catalytic cycle. The rate-limiting conformational change of MV is a closed-to-open transition of the nucleotide binding region prior to the release of ADP. This study investigates the role of a specific structural element called as switch II and the magnesium (Mg) ion in the coupling between the nucleotide-and actin binding regions and their role in mediating the rate-limiting transition. Switch II was found to be critical in both these processes, while Mg played a central role in modulating the rate-limiting transition prior to ADP release. A long standing question about the precise temporal kinetics of the lever arm swing in relation to the product release steps and force generation is also unambiguously answered by this work. A novel fluorophore labeling strategy combined with stopped-flow FRET experiments unravels the kinetic mechanism of lever arm swing. The recovery stroke occurs concurrent with formation of the hydrolysis competent state. The powerstroke occurs in two phases, a fast phase precedes phosphate release and a slow phase precedes the release of ADP.

They encounter difficulties operating in unstructured and highly congested  environments.  Several animal organs such as elephant trunks, mammal and lizard tongues, and octopus arms address this problem by not having any rigid components.  These muscular hydrostats are composed of natural muscles and connective tissue.  Animal muscle is soft material with large strain, moderate stress, high efficiency, fast response time, high power/weight ratio and long lifetime, capabilities that conventional actuators do not possess.  Researchers have been inspired by biology to design, build and test soft robotic manipulators based on electro-active polymers and pneumatic muscles.  The unusual compliance and redundant degrees of freedom of these manipulators are essential for applications requiring delicate manipulation in cluttered and/or unstructured environments.  With no hard parts, these robots can squeeze through tiny spaces and manipulate objects of widely-varying sizes.\n A key challenge in the design and control of soft robotic manipulators is the development of accurate models that predict the shape of the arm given the loading and actuation inputs.  Existing models make several assumptions about the material properties, loading conditions and kinematics of these manipulators and are not sufficiently accurate under in real world situations.  The first contribution of this thesis is the development of geometrically exact models that describe the dynamics of soft robotic manipulators that can be used in design, sensing, stability analysis, and control.  The manipulator is modeled using Cosserat rod theory and takes into account the effect of finite shear, curvature and extension, and material nonlinearities.  The model is validated on the OctArm V manipulator.  Parametric studies are done with the model to gain an understanding of the mechanics of soft robotic manipulators, providing insight into the optimal design of pneumatic and hydraulic soft manipulators.  \n Theoretically, soft robots have infinite degrees of freedom (dof), but the number of sensors and actuators are limited. This complicates shape estimation and control of soft robotic manipulators. The second contribution of this thesis is the development of three novel methods of shape estimation for soft robotic manipulators based on the geometrically exact model. The first method uses load cells mounted at the base of the manipulator and the second method makes use of cable encoders running through the length of the manipulator. The third method uses inclinometers mounted at the end of each section of the manipulator. Using simulation and experiments these methods are compared for the accuracy of endpoint position estimation for unloaded and loaded OctArm VI.\n \nOctArm-type soft robotic manipulators are complex and difficult to design and fabricate. The third major contribution of this thesis is a simpler, cost effective design for a pneumatic air muscle based soft robotic manipulator in which the actuators for the distal section extend from the base to the tip of the arm, thereby simplifying the pneumatic design and eliminating the need for complex manifolds. We compare the workspace and dexterity of this new continuous tube design with the OctArm manipulator and conclude that although the two designs have comparable workspace area, the OctArm workspace has better dexterity characteristics.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1678], "author_name_tesi": "Trivedi, Deepak ", "last_name_ssi": "Trivedi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deepak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Christopher Rahn", "Eric M Mockensturm", "George A Lesieutre", "Mary I Frecker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["continuum mechanics", "design optimization cosserat rod", "soft robotic manipulators", "pneumatic air muscles"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "IMPROVEMENT OF MAGNETIC CARBON NANOTUBE DISPERSION BY SURFACE TREATMENT WITH DIAZONIUM SALT FOR AEROSPACE POLYMER NANOCOMPOSITES", "id": "15151sst5103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15151", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be potentially integrated into fiber reinforced plastics (FRPs) to improve interlaminar\nstrength and transport properties, but application of CNT-PNCs is currently limited\ndue to difficulty in scalable fabrication. FRPs, or composites, find applications\nin commercial aircraft and spacecraft structures due to their high mass-specific\nstrength and stiffness instead of other metal alternatives. However, due to their\nmulti-layer structure, the composites experience delamination under in-plane compressive\nloads, and have poor thermal and electrical transport properties. Recently,\nintegration of nanofillers into these composites has been investigated to overcome\nthese limitations. Nanofillers, due to the size scale, have high crystallinity, and thus\nsuperior mechanical and transport properties. Among many nanofillers, carbon\nnanotubes uniquely have very high aspect ratio and exceptional multi-functional\nproperties, and thus CNT-PNCs are sought-after novel materials in aerospace\napplications for their tailorable and advanced mechanical, electrical, thermal, and\nactuation/sensing properties. However, their application is currently limited, because\nCNTs have a strong tendency to agglomerate, and cannot be implemented in\na controlled manner, especially in bulk. Without proper control of nanofiller distribution,\nproperty enhancement cannot be achieved. This work involves experimental\ninvestigation of effective dispersion and active assembly of CNTs using surface\nfunctionalization and external magnetic fields, as a scalable and energy-efficient\nmanufacturing process for structuring CNT-PNCs. The CNTs are first processed to\nbe magnetically responsive, by e-beam coating the CNT tips with Nickel (Ni), after\noxygen plasma functionalization to ensure Ni-CNT adhesion. The Ni-coated CNTs\nare then functionalized by in-situ formation of diazonium salt on their surfaces, to\nimprove their dispersion and promote covalent bonding with the bisphenol-F based\nepoxy matrix (EPON 862). CNT alignment is achieved within the viscous matrix\n(~70 cP), after the short (~40 min) magnetic field application of small strength\n(~400 G vs. ~50 G of a typical refrigerator magnet). The steps to fabricate\nand functionalize the Ni-coated CNTs and to structure and cure CNT-PNCs are\ndeveloped and improved in terms of the effective magnetic responsiveness, functionalization\ndegree, and alignment degree. This work demonstrated the unique and scalable fabrication method of CNT-PNCs by improving CNT dispersion through\nthe in-situ surface treatment that is critical for magnetic structuring of CNTs.\nIn future, more detailed studies will be conducted about the damages caused to\nCNTs by this functionalization process, such as CNT graphitic structures, CNT\nlengths, and Ni coating adherence, and more.

The Story of Movies materials were commissioned and created by The Film Foundation in partnership with IBM and TCM- Turner Classic Movies. Using experimental methodological frames, bricolage and intersectionality, the research aims to understand multiple ways of reading the texts contained in the data set: the motion picture Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), the Story of Movies teacher\u2019s guide, and the students activities that correspond to the film. Furthermore, the curriculum\u2019s productions of race and gender are explored through visual and linguistic tropes. Focusing on historical and cultural imperatives outlined in the curriculum, the research questions prioritize race, namely Afro-descended identity/ies, and gender roles- specifically feminine performance, in conjunction with post-9/11 citizenship identity to carefully consider curriculum ideology, and what constitutes the ideal American citizen. \nUltimately, I argue that the Story of Movies retooling of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington focuses on nation-building and national pride as rooted in a white (male) historical narrative of the country\u2019s social development via World War II, and through the type of democracy promoted within the United States government, namely the U.S. Senate. Examining these institutional cornerstones, I centralize race and gender in order to present possible counter-narratives in order to challenge this under-complicated perspective of who and what a citizen is. Additionally, I work to address the bias found within the curriculum not only by highlighting shortcomings through unequal representation and misappropriation, but also by critiquing and revising contemporary school curricula to not only include, but to emphasize social justice. \nThe Story of Movies curriculum package is not only teeming with examples of race-related deficiencies, but also it fails to problematize (and thereby reinforces) unequal gender roles. While in some ways the film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (as an individual, cultural artifact) can be justified by the socio-historical context in which it was produced, the curriculum itself, in its deliberate packaging of the film and its corresponding teacher and student materials, can claim no such justification. By failing to provide students with the critical tools to discern these problematic representations within the films that are part of this curriculum, in addition to other films that the students are likely to see or encounter, the Story of Movies is\u2014 at the very least\u2014 complicit in perpetuating the myth of multicultural democracy.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5879], "author_name_tesi": "Troutman, Stephanie ", "last_name_ssi": "Troutman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gail Louise Boldt", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Jeanine M Staples", "Irina Aristarkhova", "Marie Hardin", "Lindah Mhando"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gail Louise Boldt, Dissertation Advisor", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Chair", "Jeanine M Staples, Committee Chair", "Irina Aristarkhova, Committee Member", "Marie Hardin, Committee Member", "Lindah Mhando, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["curriculum", "citizenship", "female representation", "racial identity", "post-9/11 culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Diet-induced modulation of vagal sensory signaling", "id": "23416", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10576", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As obesity levels continue to rise in developed nations, it becomes increasingly important to determine the mechanisms underlying obesity. Ingested food induces the release of various neurohormones and neuropeptides, such as 5-HT, that activate the sensory vagus, which then relays the signal to the brain. These vagally-mediated satiety signals are capable of a substantial amount plasticity and modulation in response to physiological demands. The present work will investigate the effects of high fat diet (HFD) exposure on the ability of glucose to modulate the 5-HT-induced response of gastric projecting vagal afferent neurons.\nIn response to changing circulating glucose levels, vagal afferent neurons are able to alter their membrane-associated 5-HT3 receptor profile and afferent nerve function centrally at the level of the nucleus of the tractus solitaries and peripherally at the level of the nodose ganglion. In several peripheral and central tissues, protein kinase C (PKC) activity is correlated with glucose level and, in the present study, the glucose-dependent modulation of 5-HT3 receptor density and function appears to be mediated via a PKC\uf062 and/or PKC\uf064 pathway. The rapid timescale of electrophysiological effects suggest that glucose may modulate vagal sensory signaling on a minute-to-minute basis. Therefore, by regulating the number of functional 5-HT3 receptors associated with the membrane of gastric vagal afferent neurons, extracellular glucose is able to adapt its own \u2018perception\u2019, allowing for amplification and prolongation of its own signaling.\nWhile exposure to a HFD does not affect either the proportion of gastric vagal afferent neurons that respond to 5-HT, or the magnitude of the 5-HT-induced response, the ability of glucose to modulate 5-HT3 receptor density and function is disrupted, even after relatively short periods of HFD exposure, well in advance of the development of obesity or dysregulation of blood glucose levels, suggesting that diet may profoundly affect vagal afferent responsiveness independent of obesity.\nWhile short periods of HFD exposure disrupt and attenuate the ability of glucose to modulate 5-HT-mediated vagal signaling, restoration of a normal diet permits recovery although the time-scale for recovery appears to be much longer than that required to induce the initial\nreduced sensitivity. This provides additional support for the concept that vago-vagal neurocircuits are sensitive to diet-induced modulation and adaptation. Furthermore, the reversibility of the adverse effects of HFD exposure suggests that peripheral vagal afferents may be a more readily accessible and attractive target for obesity research, potentially opening the door to new treatment options and preventative techniques.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10217], "author_name_tesi": "Troy, Amanda Erin", "last_name_ssi": "Troy", "middle_name_ssi": "Erin", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kirsteen Nairn Browning", "Gregory Michael Holmes", "Andras Hajnal", "Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Ann Ouyang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kirsteen Nairn Browning, Dissertation Advisor", "Gregory Michael Holmes, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Patricia Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Ann Ouyang, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["vagus", "vagal afferent", "5-HT", "glucose", "high fat diet", "protein kinase C", "electrophysiology", "immunocytochemistry", "5-HT3 receptor"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Structural and Hydrodynamic Design Optimization Enhancements with Application to Marine Hydrokinetic Turbine Blades\n\n\n\n", "id": "12587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4137", "abstract_tesi": "To increase the global power generated by marine sources, marine hydrokinetic turbines\nmust be utilized.

The hypothesis that media practitioners in smaller metropolitan areas will be more likely to privilege voices supporting new stadium construction is examined. The case study method is utilized and content analysis is employed to determine media coverage trends in major American metropolitan areas. Cincinnati and Pittsburgh are examined as small market cities, while Boston and New York are explored as larger market cities. Evidence is provided that larger markets adopt a more critical position than small market cities regarding new stadium construction in newspaper opinion content. Large market publications are similar to smaller market counterparts in providing greater opportunity for expression to pro-stadium voices. Boston, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh provided more detailed news coverage of this issue than New York City, the largest media market observed. The ramifications of such coverage tendencies for the broader public are examined. Historic examination of stadium construction coverage from the Progressive Era to the present provides evidence of a changing policy landscape. Construction policy changes include a shifting of power from political leaders to sports franchise owners and political approval of more dramatic levels of stadium-related taxpayer subsidies.

We find that deregulated reactors are more likely to invest in power uprates. Moreover, after deregulation boiling water reactors are more likely to choose Extended Power Uprates (EPUs) that could add up to 20 percent of the original power, but pressurized water reactors, another type of reactors for which EPUs are more technically challenging, tend to select other types of uprates that add less of reactor power. Deregulation incentivizes reactors to pursue profitable investments and propels them to make careful investment decisions.\n\nChapter 2: Electricity Market Restructuring, Grid Power Flow Conditions, and Nuclear Power Safety in the United States\n\nThe majority of nuclear power plants in commercial operation today require uninterrupted electrical power supply from transmission grid, controlled within a stringent range of voltage and frequency, to support critical plant safety functions. We study nuclear plant safety events caused by power flow transients over the transmission grid and reported by nuclear plants to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission between 1990 and 2011, and find that for plants operate in areas with competitive wholesale electricity markets, the likelihood to experience unplanned reactor emergency shutdowns have increased more than two times, mainly due to unanalyzed or unexpected abnormal voltages over transmission grid. Our study suggests that electricity market restructuring may have introduced an increasing challenge to nuclear plant operational safety, as well as to maintaining transmission grid voltage stability.\n\nChapter 3: Deregulation and Nuclear Plant Performance: Evidence from Reactor Initiating Events in the United States \n\nNuclear power reactor initiating events, which are unplanned automatic or manual reactor trips, serve as a primary indicator of reactor performance. We study all \"plant-centered\" initiating events. i.e. events due to plant internal root causes, between 1988 and 2012, and have two main findings. First, we find that deregulated reactors have significantly decreased the frequency of initiating events due to equipment failure. Second, we did not find changes in the frequency of initiating events due to human error. These findings suggest that deregulated reactors may put more emphasis on maintaining the equipment in sound operation and less emphasis is put on the training and human performance side.

Fantasy was viewed as a means of bridging the visible and the invisible, while narrative as a means of making sense of lives. Reading fantasy through the lens of sociological imagination was considered as a social project which provided readers a way of inquiring social reality. Stepping in and out the separated world in fantasy novels, readers were invited to connect ourselves as subjects and characters with the society as settings in both the created and our own stories. We are offered opportunities to imagine beyond our limitations and discover possibilities for re-reading, re-telling, and re-interpreting our personal narrative. The study examined two novels by Lois Lowry, The Giver and Gathering Blue, to reveal how this method of reading helps readers to activate our sociological imagination. It also analyzed two other novels from Earthsea series by Ursula Le Guin, The Tombs of Atuan and Tehanu; through reflecting on my life story along with the analysis, it was demonstrated that how we as readers can take a further step to operate our capacity for sociological imagination to re-interpret our personal narrative. \n\tThe finding of this study indicates that by experiencing the unfamiliar provided by fantasy literature through the lens of sociological imagination, readers could discover things we did not expect to uncover. This research transformed from a metaphor of journey as a beginning standpoint to one of weaving and composing. As a result, it leads me, as the researcher of this study, to recommend that this method of reading provides readers, both children and adults, with a good approach to extend our world of wonder. I would also invite educators to show this rich ground of metaphors offered by fantasy novels to guide children to imagine more possibilities for their own personal reality.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2186], "author_name_tesi": "Tsai, Hsin-Chun Jamie", "last_name_ssi": "Tsai", "middle_name_ssi": "Jamie", "first_name_ssi": "Hsin-Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Steven Herb", "Reiko Tachibana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Member", "Steven Herb, Committee Member", "Reiko Tachibana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transform", "revision"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Usage-based cognitive semantics in L2 collocation: A microgenetic analysis of EFL students' collocational knowledge ", "id": "22710", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation project seeks to offer an alternative approach to connecting form-meaning relationships of L2 verb-noun collocations whereby the two are not arbitrary, as are conventionally discussed in formal linguistics, but can be integrated as a unified entity from a cognitive and sociocultral perspective. L2 collocations have been recognized as posing difficulties for L2 adult learners. The present study derived from cognitive semantics and sociocultural theory proposes the practice of semantics of thought \u2013 the conceptualization process based word meanings. This study argues that verb meanings provide an orientating basis for conceptualizing a verb-noun collocation event. By learning the conceptual meanings of the target verbs (i.e., make, do, take, get and have) via the SCOBAs (Schemas for the Orienting Basis of Action) and forming a semantics of thought, L2 speakers can pay more attention to the relationship between the linguistic form and the conceptualization of the collocation event derived from the verb\u2019s meaning. \nGrounded in Vygotsky\u2019s developmental education, this research recruited seven EFL undergraduate students and then involved them in a six-week pedagogical program. This study demonstrates how participants used conceptual structures of verbs as thinking tools and mapped verb meanings onto their encyclopedic knowledge of the world in order to develop thoughtful and personal understandings of collocations. Moreover, the microgenetic analysis highlights participants\u2019 development by comparing their use and understanding of the collocated verbs before and after the enrichment program. Finally, both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicate that participants increased their collocational knowledge after concept-based instruction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9991], "author_name_tesi": "Tsai, Mei-hsing ", "last_name_ssi": "Tsai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mei-hsing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Xiaofei Lu", "Matthew Edward Poehner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Dissertation Advisor", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Xiaofei Lu, Committee Member", "Matthew Edward Poehner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["L2 collocation", "cognitive semantics", "sociocultural theory", "concept-based instruction", "EFL"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "GUIDING TAIWANESE KINDERGATENERS' EMOTIONAL UNDERSTANDING AND EMOTION REGULATION: THE EFFECTS OF CHILDREN\u00a1\u00a6S PICTURE BOOKS\n", "id": "8193", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4553", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of children\u00a1\u00a6s picture books and activities on the emotional understanding and emotion regulation of 5- and 6-year-old Taiwanese students. A quasi-experimental design was employed to examine the effectiveness of different treatments on children\u00a1\u00a6s emotional understanding and emotion regulation between treatment groups. The treatment groups were composed of three kindergarten classrooms in one school situated in the south of Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. Three treatments were randomly assigned to each treatment group: Experimental Group One was given children\u00a1\u00a6s picture books related to emotions and extra activities related to the English alphabet; Experimental Group Two was given children\u00a1\u00a6s picture books and extra activities related to emotions; and the control group was given children\u00a1\u00a6s picture books related to animals and extra activities related to the English alphabet. The investigator was the instructor of the three treatment groups. Each group received treatments, twice per week, 40 minutes per session, for eight weeks. \nInstruction assessments used in this study included the Emotion Recognition Questionnaire (ERQ), which measures children\u00a1\u00a6s emotional understanding by the research assistant; the Emotion Regulation Checklist (ERC) of school teachers, which assesses children\u00a1\u00a6s emotion regulation; and the Head Start Competence Scale-Parents Version (HSCS-P), which examines children\u00a1\u00a6s emotional understanding and emotion regulation by parents. These assessments were distributed before treatments began and again after two weeks of treatment. The research assistant, teachers, and parents were in charge of measuring children\u00a1\u00a6s emotional understanding and emotion regulation.  \nAnalyzing data via One-Way ANOVA, the results of the ERQ as evaluated by the research assistant showed that there are differences between treatment groups. The mean difference (posttest minus pretest) for Experimental Group Two was significantly higher than that for the control group. Teachers used the ERC to evaluate children\u00a1\u00a6s emotion regulation; results showed that a statistically significant difference arose among the three treatment groups. The mean difference (posttest minus pretest) for Experimental Groups One and Two was significantly higher than that for the control group. The results of the HSCS-P, which were evaluated by parents, showed that there are no significant differences in children\u00a1\u00a6s emotional understanding and emotion regulation among the three treatment groups.  \nStudy findings showed that in the opinion of school teachers, children\u00a1\u00a6s emotion regulation were influenced after treatments related to emotion. From the ERQ as evaluated by the research assistant, children\u00a1\u00a6s emotional understanding was also improved by books and extra activities related to emotion. The study results could provide researchers, counselors, and early childhood practitioners with guidelines and resources for future emotional learning possibilities using children\u00a1\u00a6s picture books and related activities.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4521], "author_name_tesi": "Tsai, Min-Ju ", "last_name_ssi": "Tsai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min-Ju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Richard Hazler", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Chair", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Member", "Richard Hazler, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["children's picture books", "emotional understanding", "emotion regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Enabling New Computation Paradigms with Emerging Technologies", "id": "14401wzt114", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14401", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For the last decade, Moore's law has slowed down while Dennard scaling has come to an end. Thus, performance improvements can no longer rely on the shrinking of transistor sizes. On top of that heat-sink and power budgets limit the computation per unit chip area. Therefore, new technologies are being invented to go beyond the scope, and break the limitations, of traditional computer architecture using Boolean operations.\nComputing physics, which deploy computations onto artificial components with configurable behaviors using physical phenomenon, is one category of alternative possibilities. For example, HyperFET coupled-oscillators can be used to find the matching degree efficiently, utilizing physical phenomenon along with the electrical current controlled by Boolean logic. In addition, brain-inspired neuromorphic hardware can be built to perform the inference of the neural networks that classify and make decisions in a fault-tolerant manner. \nWhile these new technologies show great potential in performing the tasks with native support, this work explores new computation paradigms that can further improve the functionality and energy efficiency of the systems. These new computation paradigms include configurable coupled oscillators, supported by thorough modeling from device-, circuit-, to system-level, and the approaches to map the data-preprocessing onto a digital emulation platform of spiking neural networks with either explicit-programming or parrot-training. \nThis work not only shows the successful implementations of the above and their power benefits, but also provides insights to designing systems using these new computing technologies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15217], "author_name_tesi": "Tsai, Wei Yu", "last_name_ssi": "Tsai", "middle_name_ssi": "Yu", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "John Morgan Sampson", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Bruce Gluckman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "John Morgan Sampson, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Bruce Gluckman, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Non-Boolean Computation", "Neural Networks", "Coupled Scillators", "Low-power Computation", "Image Processing", "Audio Processing"]}]
