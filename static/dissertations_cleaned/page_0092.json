Perfectionism, affective instability, and interpersonal difficulties are identified as core features, or \u201cmaintaining mechanisms,\u201d of the most chronic and treatment-resistant eating disorders (Fairburn et al., 2003).   Goals of the study were to better understand if and how these variables differ across severity of eating disorder  symptoms.  It was predicted that the clinical group would have the highest perfectionism and depression scores and the lowest relational health scores, that the asymptomatic group would have the lowest perfectionism and depression scores and highest relational health scores, and that the subclinical group scores would fall between these groups.  \n\tTwo hundred and eight female college students and 38 women in treatment at an eating disorders clinic completed the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised, the Perfectionistic Self-Presentation Scale, the Quality of Relationships Inventory, the Relational Health Indices, and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.  Two MANOVA were performed; one on the perfectionism and depression variables, and the second on the relational variables.  Significant effects were found for both sets of variables, but only two variables, APS-R Discrepancy and Depression differentiated all 3 groups (clinical eating disorders, subclinical eating concerns, and asymptomatic) in the predicted directions.  The strong link found between depression and APS-R Discrepancy in those with eating disturbances suggests that depression is an affective correlate to the cognitive processes of maladaptive perfectionism.  Higher levels of perfectionistic self-presentation were linked with clinical eating disorders, but this interpersonally-directed dimension of perfectionism did not differentiate the subclinical and asymptomatic groups.   Findings regarding relational health were significant, however, effect sizes were small. They  suggest that the most severe eating disorder symptoms may be associated with less relational support, depth, authenticity and engagement. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5137], "author_name_tesi": "Patterson, Randy Ellen", "last_name_ssi": "Patterson", "middle_name_ssi": "Ellen", "first_name_ssi": "Randy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert B Slaney", "Joyce K Illfelder Kay", "Margaret Ann Lorah", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert B Slaney, Committee Chair", "Joyce K Illfelder Kay, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["QRI", "RHI", "APS-R", "relational health", "perfectionism", "eating disorders", "CES-D", "PSPS", "perfectionistic self-presentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ADULT CHILDREN\u2019S HELP TO PARENTS: A STUDY OF BOTH ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR", "id": "14274sep241", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the U.S. population and family structures continue to shift, the norms and obligations for adult children caring for their elderly parents are being debated in the literature. My dissertation aims to understand attitudes toward helping the elderly and behaviors of giving to parents by adult children in a recent, nationally representative sample.  \n\tChapter one uses the General Social Survey and investigates attitudes toward two distinct but related topics.  First, do Americans still value filial obligation, meaning do they see adult children as an important source of help for elderly parents?  Second, which institution -  families, government, or others - do Americans see as responsible for helping the elderly with specific instrumental tasks of daily living, like laundry or errands? I find that filial obligation is similarly highly valued by many in the U.S., but there is more variation toward which institution should be responsible for care.  I find that Black respondents are more supportive of government support compared to Whites, and that respondents with some college or greater educational attainment are more supportive of families taking on this responsibility compared to those with a high school degree or less.  \n\tChapter two uses the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics to test whether experiencing a parent\u2019s divorce during childhood, from ages 0 to 16, is associated with later giving of time and money to parents.  Here, I find that experiencing a parent\u2019s divorce during childhood is not significantly associated with later giving to parents.  While Black and White adult children have differing patterns of giving to parents, this cannot be explained by their childhood experiences of family structure.  Adult children whose parents got divorced when they were young do give less to fathers compared to mothers, similar to previous research on this topic. \n\tChapter three also uses the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics and tests whether adult children\u2019s family structure is associated with financial and time transfers to parents.   Here, I focus on cohabiting adult children and divorced adult children compared to never married adult children.  I find that long-term cohabiter adult children, those who have been living with their partner for more than one year, have lower odds of giving any time to parents compared to never married adult children.  Similarly, divorced/separated adult children have lower odds of giving any time to parents compared to never married adult children.  The adult child\u2019s marital status is never significantly associated with giving patterns of financial assistance to parents.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15048], "author_name_tesi": "Patterson, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Patterson", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Molly Ann Martin", "Molly Ann Martin", "Paul R.

Digital media literacy involves youth being able to view, participate in, and make creative works with technologies in personal and meaningful ways.\n\nGames, defined in this study as structured play, provided the foundation for many of the works from 20th century art movements, such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Situationism, and Fluxus. I argue that these artists used games as methods to explore and expose rules and systems in ways of understanding the world through art. I describe how these artworks embodied complexity thinking in their use of game making methods to expose social, political, economic, and environmental systems. The game-based art pedagogy derived from this art history, also draws from the features of game-like unit operations (Bogost, 2006), strategies and tactics (de Certeau, 1997), and infinite play (Carse, 1987) to foster a critical aesthetic. \n\nComplexity thinking (or complexity theory), represents a way for constructing meaning that involves the integration of multiple types of systems, including dynamic models, closed-looped systems, and the ability to transfer one model of a system to another situation or phenomenon. Emergent behavior is supported in the complex systems modeled in video games such as SimCity and Civilization. \n\nMuch of game-based art pedagogy research centers on students learning by playing games. Learning history or other factual data in the form of games has value, however using games in this way does not encapsulate games as an artistic medium for creative purposes, only as a means for teaching. That is, while students created video games in a variety of classroom environments over the last fifteen years, typically it was done to learn subjects like math, computer science, or to develop language skills. \n\nIn my action research study, I began with the premise based on my prior teaching experience, that video game creation was an attainable goal by youth, and a valuable studio project in the art classroom to understand complexity in social systems, and learn an art history of games as artworks. I recruited youth (ages of 8-13) and taught them how to make games in four iterations of a game creation course. The make-up of the courses comprised one class of middle school girls, two classes of elementary school children, and one class of middle school boys and girls. Each class met during a five-day course, learning concepts and methods of game development by playing and making physical, board, and video games. New curricular elements for the research included a physical game activity, a mobile game using 2-D barcodes, a tabletop game connecting the video game instruction, and game cards written as independent programmable unit operations. \n\nStudents made video games that used the concepts of move, avoid, release, and contact (MARC) as a method I designed for exploring complexity thinking. I observed and recorded the participants\u2019 game making process; collected their games, journals, and pre and post surveys; and from these observations and feedback, I reviewed and revised the curriculum for each class. I interviewed the other course instructors who used the curriculum that I developed providing additional insight to the pedagogy, delivery of the curriculum, and student learning. Three months after the courses ended, a sample set of students and parents took part in follow-up interviews regarding the impact of the course. Because games, specifically digital games (also called video games), are seen as potentially corrupting to children, I gathered parental input on their child\u2019s involvement. \n\nAt the center of this study\u2019s curriculum, playful, game-like methods were used to create game-based artworks. Students critiqued games using detailed, expressive language to describe how games work, critically aware of how commercial games differ in complexity. From their game making experiences, students gained confidence and knowledge finding game structures in everyday life and how to make programmable media like video games. This study argues that learning through game-based art pedagogy, students begin to understand complexity thinking by producing digital media as a form of artistic expression, and as a form of preparation for future learning in and beyond a 4-12th grade art curriculum.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5259], "author_name_tesi": "Patton, Ryan Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Patton", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Matthew Kenyon", "Brian K Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Matthew Kenyon, Committee Member", "Brian K Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pedagogy", "art", "art education", "video games", "games", "complexity theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Shaping the Future:Prospective Sensemaking in a Pioneering Firm", "id": "22453", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10085", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prospection or forward-looking thought and action is fundamental to managing an enterprise strategically (Gavetti, 2012; Hambrick & Mason, 1984; Hamel & Prahalad, 1994; Mintzberg, 1985; Sinclair, Sadler-Smith and Hodgkinson, 2010; Tsoukas and Shepherd, 2009). Although scholars have called for the need to study \u201cforesight\u201d (Hamel and Prahalad, 1996; Tsoukas and Shepherd, 2009), \u201cprescience\u201d (Corley and Gioia, 2011), and pursuit of \u201ccognitively distant opportunities\u201d (Gavetti, 2012), and suggested that organizations not only attempt to \u201cpredict\u201d the future landscape but they also try to \u201cshape\u201d it (Corley & Gioia, 2011; Gavetti, 2012; Ghemawat, 2010; Hamel and Prahalad, 1996; Narayanan and Fahey, 2004; Tsoukas and Shepherd, 2009), the processes that might enable prospective behavior have not been adequately theorized or studied. A fundamental barrier appears to be foundational assumptions about managerial cognition (Gavetti, 2012; Porac & Tschang, 2013)\u2014a situation that scholars acknowledge has led to an incomplete and impoverished view of decision-makers (see Bromiley, 2005; Porac and Tschang, 2013) and left the field with a rather pronounced \u201cbackward looking\u201d view of strategy and much in need of a \u201cforward-looking\u201d sensibility (Gavetti, Greve, Levinthal, & Ocasio, 2012: 26). With the larger agenda of stimulating and shaping discourse around \u201cforward-looking\u201d or prospective behavior in strategy literature, I pursued the theoretically and pragmatically important questions: How do firms organize for the future? Specifically, by what processes might firms shape or influence the future? Given limited literature on prospection, and the inadequacy of the prevalent cognitive paradigm to explain the phenomenon, I employed a grounded theory approach (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) to empirically investigate the thought and action of a pioneering handloom retail organization that, over five decades, has shaped and transformed the landscape of its industry. \n\nThe primary contribution of this study is an empirically grounded theoretical model of prospective sensemaking in a pioneering firm. The model serves to make three theoretical contributions. First, it makes a fundamental contribution to the sensemaking literature by making an empirically grounded case for \u201cProspective Sensemaking\u201d, thereby extending extant sensemaking perspective\u2014that is typically rooted in retrospective processes\u2014to account for prospection or forward-looking activities. Second, it contributes to the strategic management and strategy-making literature by extending the dominant narrative of strategic behavior of firms beyond \u201cadapting\u201d to environments \u2014to \u201cshaping\u201d environments. Third, by illuminating the central role of imagination and the \u201cconstructive\u201d capabilities of the managerial mind, this study makes a fundamental contribution to the literature on the microfoundations of strategic management by making a case that managerial cognition is not only marked by \u201cbounded rationality\u201d, but also by \u201ccreative rationality\u201d.  These findings also inform literature on entrepreneurship.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9781], "author_name_tesi": "Patvardhan, Shubha Divakar", "last_name_ssi": "Patvardhan", "middle_name_ssi": "Divakar", "first_name_ssi": "Shubha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Management - Business Adminstration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Arnold Gioia", "Dennis Arnold Gioia", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi", "Donald C Hambrick", "Susan G Strauss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Arnold Gioia, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis Arnold Gioia, Committee Chair", "Vilmos Fosnocht Misangyi, Committee Chair", "Donald C Hambrick, Committee Member", "Susan G Strauss, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["forward-looking", "prospecting", "future", "sensemaking", "prospective sensemaking", "creative enactment", "imagination", "bounded rationality"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Thermal Sensing Using Micromachined Y-cut Quartz Resonators\n", "id": "8746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a process for the fabrication of miniature Y-cut Quartz resonators is presented.

We examined the independent and interactive effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) seed treatment on tomato fruit worm (Helicoverpa zea) larval growth and the activity of the defensive protein, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), in leaves of tomato plants at three different plant stages. Additionally, we measured the dosage effects of MeJA seed treatment on several vegetative and reproductive traits. To assess the effectiveness against different insects, we tested MeJA seed treatment against the tomato leaf miner (Tuta absoluta) and tobacco caterpillar (Spodoptera litura), in Brazil and Bangladesh, respectively. Results suggest that seed treatment with defense elicitors will induce defenses in plants, which is correlated with increased PPO activity in leaves and reduction in larval growth. However, fitness costs in plants were observed with higher dosage of MeJA.\nThe magnitude of the increase in chemical pesticide use in recent times in developing countries like Bangladesh is alarming, threatening to human health and the environment. We investigated level of pesticide use and status of non-chemical integrated management approaches presently among the small holder farmers, and interpreted the result to suggest how small integrated pest management (IPM) technology such as \u2018seed treatment\u2019 could be efficiently exploited in Bangladesh context. Key reforms recommended include screening of the technology under different conditions, making the seed treating elicitors easily available with proper label and formulation and government providing farmers with proper subsidies and training of know-how to encourage farmers who are interested toward non-chemical based pest management. If successfully integrated with other facets of an integrated pest management program, the use of MeJA as elicitors of plant defense could be an important tool in managing insect pests and contribute to a reduction in applications of chemical pesticides. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9071], "author_name_tesi": "Paudel, Sulav ", "last_name_ssi": "Paudel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sulav", "degree_name_ssi": "M AGR", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Agriculture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edwin George Rajotte", "Gary Felton", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edwin George Rajotte, Thesis Advisor", "Gary Felton, Thesis Advisor", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plant defense elicitors", "Methyl Jasmonate", "Integrated pest management"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Musical Expressions of Death in Renaissance Spain: A Comparative Study of Selected Requiem Masses\n", "id": "10771", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2203", "abstract_tesi": "The Catholic Church served as an institution of unparalleled importance in late fifteenth-century Spain.  The Spanish monarchs endorsed a program to enforce uniformity of belief, skillfully extending their authority over the Spanish Church.  Spain had a fascination with death evident among writers, including mystics, theologians, and monarchs unseen elsewhere in Europe. \n \nThe Spanish composers Crist\u00f3bal de Morales and Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria both wrote two Requiem Masses: one that is quintessentially Spanish in style and one that is a hybrid of both Roman and Spanish stylistic practices.  The analysis of musical elements within these Masses shows how the emotion of Spanish polyphonic Requiem Masses was controlled and how it conformed to a distinctly Spanish obsession with death. \n \nSpanish Requiem Masses are characterized by the contrasts inherent in chant performance, as well as a chant-bearing cantus.  These procedures attest to the composers\u2019 introspective nature.  Eschewing displays of ingenuity or virtuosity, Morales and Victoria approached the theme of death in the most restrained and reverential way because the Spanish believed that music had a dangerous power.\n\nWith emphasis from the Spanish Church on doctrinal purity and proper decorum, the understanding of music and its powers in late medieval and early modern Spain became intertwined with attempts to cleanse the Church of inappropriate behavior.  The aesthetic of purity that occurred in Spain was abandoned in the New World colonies in an effort to incorporate indigenous practices and thus to convert the natives more easily.  However, nearly a century after contact, polyphonic singing schools had been established and Morales\u2019s Requiem Masses became a standard in Mexico.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2184], "author_name_tesi": "Paudler, Heather Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Paudler", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marica Susan Tacconi", "Marica Susan Tacconi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marica Susan Tacconi, Thesis Advisor", "Marica Susan Tacconi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cristobal de Morales", "Tomas Luis de Victoria", "Requiem Mass", "Palestrina"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Aeroacoustic computation of tones generated from low Mach number cavity flows, using a preconditioned method", "id": "13384bsp100", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13384", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The hydrodynamically generated noise produced from flow over cavities includes both broadband and tones. The frequency content and amplitude of the resulting noise is a function of the cavity geometry and the approaching boundary layer.  The cavity length to depth ratio (L/D) is an important parameter that governs the characteristics of cavity noise generated. While both of the noise components are important this work will focus on the production of cavity tones. Cavity tones typically have higher sound pressure levels and can propagate over longer distances than the broadband noise.\n\nThe enhancements to the numerical code shown in this work result in the first non-hybrid tool for the prediction of low speed cavity noise. At moderate subsonic Mach numbers the direct calculation of cavity tones has been performed by numerous researchers using highly accurate spatial and time discretization. However, most researchers that are trying to predict the noise from low Mach number flows take a hybrid approach where the fluid dynamics of the simulation are solved with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver and the acoustics are solved separately. The other solver is often based on Lighthill\u2019s Acoustic Analogy or an asympototic method such as the Expansion about Incompressible Flow (EIF). This work calculates the conservative Navier-Stokes variables to directly predict the cavity tones.\n\nThe numerical solver CHOPA (Compressible, High-Order Parallel Acoustics) is extended in this work for the accurate and fast calculation of low Mach number cavity flows. A time-derivative preconditioner equalizes the acoustic wave and turbulence convective speeds to allow for a more efficient time step and shorter calculation times. Because the preconditioner destroys the time accuracy of the solution a dual-time step approach is used for the time integration. Other modifications to the code are required to facilitate the proper implementation of the preconditioner: Matrix-based artificial dissipation, buffer zone, and extrapolation boundary condition. An extension by Buelow of Choi-Merkle\u2019s viscous preconditioner is selected for this work.\n\nThere are several different numerical validations performed on the preconditioned Navier-Stokes solver to ensure high quality solutions. First, the combination buffer zone/extrapolation boundary condition is tested by simulating the propagation of a Gaussian pressure pulse. Then the preconditioner is tested with several different analyses. The convection of a uniform velocity flow field with a random perturbation imposed on the flow field tests if the preconditioned solution is independent of the flow Mach number. Then a time accurate Gaussian pressure pulse tests the ability of the preconditioner to solve a time dependent solution. Lastly, a laminar boundary layer flow is calculated and compared to an exact solution showing that the preconditioner is effective for viscous flows.  \n\nThe prediction of cavity tones from a deep (L/D = 0.78) and shallow (L/D = 2.35) cavity is simulated for comparison against the experimental measurements of Block. The Mach number of the simulations varied from 0.05 to 0.4. The cavity tone frequencies have an acceptable comparison against the measurements for the deep cavity. However, the shallow cavity tones were almost independent of the flow speed, which may be an indication that standing waves in the cavity could be responsible for the tones for this geometry.  \n\nThe other cavity simulations replicated the experiment by Stallings et al.for L/D = 5.42 and L/D = 6.25 for a Mach number of 0.2. The time-averaged wall pressure fluctuations were compared to measurements. While the predicted wall pressures did not match the experiment the discrepancy is because of the existence of a \u201cwake mode\u201d in the numerical results. This is a two-dimensional phenomenon where a large vortex is generated in the cavity and then violently ejected from the cavity, significantly increasing drag. While not matching the experiment the results behave as expected for a cavity resonating in a wake mode.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13388], "author_name_tesi": "Paul, Brent Steven", "last_name_ssi": "Paul", "middle_name_ssi": "Steven", "first_name_ssi": "Brent", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip J.

Though the struggles and successes that sexual minority individuals experience in this process of development have been described, existing literature lacks in-depth information on what it is that actually encourages some persons to transition to more complex or adaptive stages of identity, while others struggle so profoundly with a gay identity that they attempt to ignore it, avoid it, or seek some way to become other-sex attracted.  Qualitative data were collected from 33 men who identified as gay or same-sex attracted and who claimed a religious or spiritual affiliation at some time in their lives.  These men participated in one- to three-hour interviews focused on their experiences of gay identity development and constructive development.  Data were analyzed according to grounded theory methodology.\nA theoretical model of gay identity development as a process of meaning-making development was constructed and is graphically represented through a concept map.  A category entitled \u201cThe Interrelated Processes of Constructive Development and Gay Identity Development\u201d was discovered to be the core category of the grounded theory.  Six other major categories, each related to the core category, emerged from the data.  These included (1) distress and struggle lead to constructive development and gay identity development, (2) attempts to avoid, hide, or change being gay, (3) finding support, (4) disclosure to others, (5) accepting self as gay, and (6) continued struggle in an oppressive context.  Analysis of the data revealed that individuals processed through these categories in a cyclical fashion, with participants describing concerns related to several categories simultaneously.

Collaborative information seeking (CIS) is composed of multiple different activities like seeking, sharing, understanding, and using information together. However, most studies of CIS have focused on how people find and retrieve information collaboratively, while overlooking the important question of how people collaboratively understand the information found by different group members. This thesis focuses on a specific aspect of CIS, namely collaborative sensemaking, which is the question of how people together understand the information found during CIS activities.  \nThe term sensemaking has been used in a variety of disciplines and simply means \u2018understanding the meaning of\u2019. Sensemaking is an important aspect of information seeking tasks. However, most of the sensemaking research has been at the individual level and there is little understanding of how sensemaking takes place in collaborative work, specifically collaborative information seeking. \nIn this thesis, I address two important gaps in current research on sensemaking in CIS activities. First, there is a lack of conceptual understanding about why and how people collaborate to understand the information found during CIS activities. Second, developers of collaborative information retrieval tools have rarely focused on helping users of such tools make sense of the information found. \nTo address these research gaps I undertook a multi-method research approach in which I conducted two studies in two different CIS domains. The first was an ethnographic study of the CIS activities of healthcare providers working in the emergency department of a large teaching hospital. In this study, I used qualitative methods like interviews, observations, shadowing, and artifacts collection to examine how groups collaboratively find, understand, and use information in a highly collaborative and information-intensive environment. The second study was conducted in the domain of collaborative Web search where I examined the search and sensemaking behavior of users of collaborative Web search tools. Through lab studies and the development of a tool, CoSense, I examined how collaborative sensemaking can be supported during Web search tasks. \nThrough these studies, I provide two important contributions to our understanding of sensemaking in CIS activities. First, I expand our conceptual understanding of collaborative sensemaking by highlighting the occasions and characteristics of collaborative sensemaking in CIS activities and by presenting a framework of collaborative sensemaking. Second, I provide insight into the design-features that can support sensemaking in collaborative information retrieval tools and also the challenges in designing such features. \nThe research presented in this thesis helps us extend our conceptual understanding of collaborative sensemaking and also provides insight into how collaborative sensemaking can be supported in collaborative information retrieval tools.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5489], "author_name_tesi": "Paul, Sharoda Aurushi", "last_name_ssi": "Paul", "middle_name_ssi": "Aurushi", "first_name_ssi": "Sharoda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy", "Madhu C Reddy", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Christopher N Sciamanna", "Bernard James Jansen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy, Dissertation Advisor", "Madhu C Reddy, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Christopher N Sciamanna, Committee Member", "Bernard James Jansen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sensemaking", "collaborative information seeking", "collaboration", "healthcare", "emergency department", "collaborative Web search"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Reformulation of the CSSR Algorithm and Application to Optimal Deception Strategy in Two Player Games", "id": "25044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11204", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis we explore a reformulation of the Casual State Splitting and Reconstruction (CSSR) algorithm and an application to optimal strategies for deception in repeated two-player games.

That is, we seek to adapt composite concepts to take advantage of the considerable variance in properties associated with different microstructures.  This new class of composites is called microstructure composites.  Microstructure composites are predominately single phase ceramics that utilize multiple distinct microstructure features in the same composite to obtain unique property combinations.  Spatial control and composite connectivity of the individual microstructure components of a microstructure composite are ultimately the key to developing and controlling useful and unique properties.  Microstructural features can be controlled via the starting location and transport of the dopants, minority second phases, and liquid phases that are used to manipulate microstructure development.  This work focuses on textured-equiaxed microstructure in the Al2O3 system.  Texture is obtained in situ using templated grain growth (TGG).  \nTo control microstructure development locally during microstructure composite fabrication, it is important to use relatively low levels of dopant to mitigate the effects of dopant interdiffusion.  Therefore, the development of texture in &#945;-Al2O3 using TGG was explored under low liquid-phase dopant concentration conditions.  High temperature dilatometry was performed to quantify the effect of template constraint on x-y plane shirinkage and the extent to which this constraint could be mitigated as a function of the dopant concentration.  x-y plane shrinkage was observed to be increasingly constrained with increasing template loadng and decreasing dopant concentration.  Final x-y plane shrinkage was greater for samples with 0.14 wt% dopant than for those without dopant, despite have a much lower peak strain rate.  It was concluded that densification was impeded by the dopant at lower temperatures but enhanced significantly above 1450\u00b0C. Texture is highly developed in samples with no dopant and 0.14 wt% dopant by 1550\u00b0C and in samples with 2 wt% dopant by 1350\u00b0C.\nWe proposed a new class of composites (called microstructure composites) that accesses different component properties not through the use of distinct materials, but rather through the exploitation of the microstructure-property relationship within a single material.

Therefore, the development of texture in &#945;-Al2O3 using low liquid-phase dopant concentrations was explored, with a focus on the effect of template constraint on texture plane shrinkage.  High quality texture was obtained with just 0.14 wt% (SiO2 + CaO) dopant.  Textured Al2O3 exhibited transgranular fracture, as well as lower strength and fracture toughness than the fine-grained equiaxed Al2O3.\nA processing strategy using tape casting was developed for the fabrication of textured-equiaxed Al2O3 microstructure composites with 2-2 connectivity.  Dopants used to promote TGG (SiO2 + CaO) were included in the templated tapes and dopants used to prevent abnormal grain growth (MgO) were included in the non templated tapes, which are subsequently stacked, laminated, and co-sintered.  Appropriate dopant concentrations and sintering conditions that enable the production of well-textured layers and fine-grained equiaxed layers seperated by a sharp interface were identified.  It was found that densification and microstructure development within textured and equiaxed layers is affected by changes in both differential sintering stress and dopant diffusion distance associated with layer thickess and the volume percent of textured layers within the composite.  \nSignificant crack deflection was observed during bend testing of composites with porous textured layers (2-5 vol% porosity), resulting in highly non-catastrophic failure  (with W.O.F. up to 1 kJ/m2).  Crack deflection, often millimeters in length, occurred along the basal faces of templated grains within the textured.  Textured layers that deflect cracks (i.e. those with porosity) had significantly lower interfacial fracture energies than textured layers that do not deflect cracks (i.e. those without porosity).  It was determined that crack deflection is a composite effect and the result of the combination of the anisotropic fracture energy of textured Al2O3 and the residual compressive stresses developed from thermal expansion mismatch.  Other observed fracture phenomena include multiple cracking / crack arrest and preliminary evidence of flaw tolerance.\n\tTextured-equiaxed Al2O3 microstructure composites of additional connectivities, (including 1-3, 0-3, and 3-3) were produced by screen printing and co-casting processes.  Template alignment during the screen printing process was demonstrated, allowing the capability to print complex textured features.  Co-casting was used to produce single tapes with templated and non-templated segments.  A variety of stacking strategies were employed to generate various 1-3 and 3-3 composites (including cross-ply composites).

Such decisions, called the first-best, would be made if the supply chain\nwere centralized so that a single decision-maker could force all firms to take\nrecommended actions. Under decentralized decision-making, in order to\nimplement first-best one needs to impose a proper structure of incentives.\nSupply chain literature, building upon developments in mechanism design,\nproposes various coordination schemes in the applied business contexts. However,\nthe empirical evidence, coming both from the real world and laboratory experiments,\nconfronts many theoretical predictions. In particular, theoretically optimal\ncontracts are notably more complex than those used in the real world. More\nimportantly, in laboratory experiments the theoretically optimal contracts\nnot just fail to coordinate but, ironically, perform very close to the Double\nMarginalization benchmark. Thus, legitimate concerns regarding ability of the\nproposed schemes to coordinate in applied contexts arise. This\ndissertation focuses on some of the factors leading to coordination failures\nand investigates their impact on the performance of a supply chain.\n\n\nChapter \"Contingent contract\" analyzes a scenario when externalities, created by the third parties,\nforce supply chain partners to use contracts contingent on revealed\ninformation. Most of the supply chain literature on coordination deals with\nperfect information models. The assumption of perfect information is usually\njustified by instances of information sharing, observed in practice.\nResearchers conjecture that information sharing ensures perfect information.\nHowever, there exists empirical evidence that even under the ultimate form of\ninformation sharing, when parties implement \"open book accounting\", revealed information may not be true.\nUnfortunately, there is always a possibility to misrepresent information.\nNotably, under perfect information sharing supply chain partners are likely to\nfind themselves in a situation when they essentially have no choice other than\nto use a contract that delivers first-best provided that \"open\nbooks\" contain truth. The model of this chapter analyzes\nperformance of a supplier-buyer supply chain under the assumption that\nquestioning each other's reports is prohibitively costly, while parties are\naware of possible misrepresentation. Therefore, no matter who offers a\ncontract, it cannot be a screening contract or anything else except a\ncontingent contract that delivers \"first-best\", given revealed information. The outcome of the\narising Bayesian game is distribution-specific, and can be very different from\nthe conjectured performance of a \"coordinating\" contract.\n\n\nChapter \"Fairness and coordination failures in supply chain contracts\" addresses a gap between performance of the contracts suggested by\nthe standard theory, which assumes fully rational profit-maximizing players,\nand existing data, obtained in the experimental tests of coordinating\ncontracts. Numerous experimental studies find\nthat human decision-makers are neither perfectly rational nor\nprofit-maximizers. While various behavioral factors, such as risk-\nand loss-aversion, counter-factual payoffs and more general social preferences\ncan greatly affect contracting outcomes, they cannot fully explain the\nexisting data. In the controlled laboratory environment, it is possible to\neither completely eliminate some of these factors, or, at least, to significantly\nmitigate and control for them. What is not possible to eliminate, is the players'\nattitude to contracting outcomes, most commonly called \"fairness concerns\". The existing models, incorporating\nfairness concerns into models, assume fairness concerns of players is common\nknowledge. Realistically, how much a particular person cares about fairness\ncannot be easily observed or measured and, in fact, is not known to anybody\nelse except that person. In other words, fairness concerns are private\ninformation. Therefore, the model presented here takes the next step and\ntreats fairness concerns as private information of players. Given the\nresulting information asymmetry, it is not surprising that coordination of a\ndyadic channel with a contract is, in general, no longer possible. At the same time, \nis possible to coordinate a channel with just a wholesale price\ncontract in case the retailer is sufficiently averse to making higher profit\nthan the supplier. However, we show that when the contract choice is endogenous, the supplier will\nnot choose a wholesale price contract but, instead, a profit-maximizing\ncontract that does not coordinate. The results of the experiment that tests\nthe model's predictions, as well as some underlying assumptions and competing\ntheories, provide strong support for the theory and show that fairness\norganizes the data very well.\n\n\nChapter \"Competition and contracting in supply chains\" presents a simple and, in many respects, robust coordination\nmechanism. Its performance approaches first-best asymptotically in a setting\nwith one supplier and multiple retailers. By introducing horizontal (Bertrand)\ncompetition among the retailers the supplier not only induces retailers to\nmake first-best decisions, but also does it by means of the simplest possible\nlinear pricing scheme. Competition does the entire coordinating job, whereas a\nwholesale price contract suffices to extract all profit of the\ncompeting retailers. Although Bertrand\ncompetition is not a new concept, little has been known about its \nactual performance in the contacting context. It turns out that a competition-based \nmechanism is not only extremely simple, but it is also robust to several\nrelaxations of the standard assumptions, any of which is enough \ndestroy a coordinating contract. First, it survives certain types of\ninformation asymmetry. In the extreme example of\nprivate information used in this chapter, the mechanism coordinates the channel\neven if the supplier is not aware of the very fact of private information.\nSecond, Chapter \"Fairness and coordination failures in supply chain contracts\" shows how fairness concerns generally make coordination of a\ndyadic channel impossible. However, for the competition-based mechanism\nfairness concerns is not an obstacle. Turning to the methodological aspects, \nwe would like to note that the mainstream literature\nsuggests coordinating contracts resulting from models that assume the\nsupplier's ability to make a \"take-it-or-leave-it\" offer. Credibility of such models has\nbeen long debated in the literature. Critics insist that the \"take-it-or-leave-it\" offer is either not a credible threat in the\nbilateral monopoly or it is a shortcut, implicitly implying perfect competition on the retailers' side. \nAllowing for competition explicitly not only avoids this criticism but also brings fuller insights, non-available otherwise.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6433], "author_name_tesi": "Pavlov, Valery ", "last_name_ssi": "Pavlov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Valery", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Elena Katok", "Elena Katok", "V Daniel R Guide Jr.", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Jenny Xiaoe Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Elena Katok, Dissertation Advisor", "Elena Katok, Committee Chair", "V Daniel R Guide Jr., Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member", "Jenny Xiaoe Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supply chain", "coordination mechanisms", "coordinating contracts"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "LUNG DEVELOPMENT AND NEONATAL LUNG DISEASE:\nSURFACTANT PROTEINS AS STUDY MODEL\n\n", "id": "7661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3208", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are approximately 400, 000 infants born prematurely each year in the United States alone.  Recent technological advances in perinatal and neonatal medicine have decreased morbidity and increased survival rates of prematurely born infants.  Modern therapies, such as surfactant, steroids and gentler ventilation have lead to a drastically decreased age and weight of surviving newborns.  As a result, there has been a change in incidence of neonatal pulmonary disease and its pathophysiology.  Although  current neonatal therapies have many advantages, they can cause long-term changes in lung physiology.  Even though ventilatory support of premature neonates is essential, ventilation of the anatomically and biochemically immature lung structure results in alveolar simplification and damage.  Neonatal steroid therapy, although beneficial for surfactant production, leads to the arrest of alveolarization that results in decreased number of alveoli.  These changes have been proposed to have long term consequences that may extend into adulthood.  Furthermore, the underlying genetic background appears to affect the outcome of premature birth and the differential response to therapy, such as steroids.\n\tThere is a compelling need to study normal lung development, lung pathogenesis due to premature birth, and the effects of current and novel therapeutic treatments on both states.  In order to shed light on these processes, a multifaceted but integrated approach is needed.  Such approach should incorporate knowledge gained from models of lung development and lung disease, as well as knowledge derived from clinical and translational studies of neonatal pulmonary disease.   \n\tThe work presented in this thesis describes;  1) development of an in vivo model of human fetal lung development and;  2) a study of the genetic background of neonatal pulmonary lung disease.  Specifically, this in vivo model allows for the study of human lung developmental processes and could be used to study the effects of current and novel therapeutic modalities on lung development and pathogenesis.  In addition, the specific effects of these modalities can be studied by choosing fetal lungs with the genetic background of interest.  Clinical and translational studies as the one presented in this thesis provide the starting point for further exploration of these processes.  \nThe focus of the studies presented here has been on the role of surfactant proteins in lung development and neonatal lung disease.  These proteins are good candidate genes for these studies due to their essential role in lung development, lung maturation, and host defense.  Development of a functional alveolar epithelium capable of gas exchange and surfactant secretion is essential for successful adaptation of the fetus to extra-uterine life. Premature birth is commonly characterized by a deficiency and perturbation of the surfactant system.  Pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein complex produced by type II pneumocytes that acts to reduce surface tension at the air-liquid interface in the alveolus and, thereby, prevents atelectasis. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D have multiple important roles within the alveolus and are subject to developmentally and hormonally regulated expression.  \nSpecific aim I of this thesis describes an in vivo xenograft model of human fetal lung development.  In this model, human fetal lung tissues were grafted either beneath the renal capsule or the skin of athymic mice (NCr-nu). Tissues were analyzed from 3 to 42 days post-grafting for morphological alterations by light and electron microscopy (EM), and for mRNA and protein content of surfactant proteins by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry (ICC), respectively.  The changes observed mimic those of human lung development in utero in many respects, including the differentiation of epithelium to the saccular stage. However, each stage of development occurred over approximately one week in the graft in contrast to the eight weeks of in utero development.  At all time points examined, all four surfactant proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D) were detected in the epithelium by ICC.  Lamellar bodies were first identified by EM in 14 day xenografts.  By day 21, significant increase was observed in both the number of lamellar bodies per cell and lamellar body positive cells.  Cellular proliferation, as marked by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ICC and elastic fiber deposition resembled those of canalicular and saccular in utero development. Tissues that were grafted longer than 28 days, started to undergo distention of alveoli, presumably due to the accumulation of fluid.  These findings indicate that the fetal lung xenograft model can serve as a valuable tool in the study of human fetal lung development.  This model can provide the means to study the impact of various pharmacological agents on the development of human fetal lungs in general, and on the surfactant proteins in particular. \nIn order to be able to better study the role of surfactant protein genetic variants in neonatal respiratory disease, rapid and accurate methods of genotyping are necessary.  In this respect, Specific aim IIa of this thesis describes the development of a novel pyrosequencing based method for genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms of SP-A, SP-B, and SP-D.  This primer extension sequencing method has been used to develop the following assays: 1) simplex and multiplex pyrosequencing assays for SP-A1 and SP-A2; 2) molecular haplotype assay for AA19(C/T) and AA50(C/G) SNPs of SP-A1; 3) simplex pyrosequencing assays for SP-B SNP B1580(C/T); 4) simplex and multiplex pyrosequencing assays for SP-D SNPs DA11(C/T) and DA160(A/G); and 5) assays for allele frequency determination in genomic DNA pools for DA11(C/T) and DA160(A/G) SNPs of SP-D.  These assays greatly accelerate individual genotype analysis of surfactant proteins thus enabling efficient and reliable genotyping of SPs in samples from individuals with various pulmonary diseases.\nThis high-throughput method of genotyping was applied to the study of surfactant protein genetic variants in Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in Specific aim IIb.  BPD is a chronic lung disease of light weight prematurely born infants that are mechanically ventilated from birth.  It has been suggested that genetic factors contribute to BPD pathogenesis.  We hypothesized that genetic variants of surfactant proteins are differentially responsive to disruption of surfactant homeostasis in premature birth and are either protection or susceptibility factors for BPD.  \nIn order to determine the role of surfactant protein (SP) genetic variants and microsatellite markers linked to SP-B, a family based association study was conducted using the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) and Family Based Association Test (FBAT).  The study group consisted of 61 families with 71 BPD affected infants.  SNP B-18_C of the SP-B gene was identified as susceptibility factor in BPD at 36 weeks (by TDT p=0.001 and by FBAT p=0.018).  Allele 6 of SP-B linked microsatellite marker AAGG was found to be a susceptibility factor in BPD (by TDT p=0.004 and by FBAT p= 0.014).  Haplotype analysis revealed two SP-A-SP-D susceptibility haplotypes, and eight susceptibility and three protective haplotypes for SP-B. \nThese genetic association data identify variants of SP and SP-linked loci to be linked to BPD.  Functional analysis of these variants should be investigated to better understand their role in BPD pathogenesis.\nTaken together, these studies provide insight into the mechanisms of lung development, dysregulation of lung development and perturbation of the surfactant system seen in premature birth, and the impact of surfactant protein genetic variants on neonatal respiratory disease.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3196], "author_name_tesi": "Pavlovic, Jelena ", "last_name_ssi": "Pavlovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jelena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joanna Floros", "David Spencer Phelps", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Mary Howett", "Hung Yu Lin", "Judith Weisz", "Brian Wigdahl"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joanna Floros, Committee Chair", "David Spencer Phelps, Committee Chair", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Mary Howett, Committee Member", "Hung Yu Lin, Committee Member", "Judith Weisz, Committee Member", "Brian Wigdahl, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["BPD", "lung development", "surfactant", "RDS", "xenograft"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Minimal Representations of U-duality Groups\n", "id": "6822", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4835", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Equations of motion of eleven dimensional supergravity compactified to $d$ dimensions on\n$(11-d)$-torus have a hidden non-compact global symmetry group\n$mathrm{E}_{11-d(11-d)}$, being examples of U-duality groups.

The method is then extended to classify CPM signals with differing pulse shapes which include raised cosine and Gaussian pulses with varying roll-off factors and bandwidth-time products respectively. The extracted features result in high classification accuracies for a variety of signals and performs robustly even in the presence of synchronization errors and carrier phase offsets.

By weighting k-distributions by the solar source  function, the FSCK method eliminates the requirement that the Planck function be constant over a spectral interval.  Consequently, integration may be carried out across the full spectrum as long as the assumption of correlation from one atmospheric level to the next remains valid. Errors resulting from the lack of correlation across the full spectrum are removed by partitioning the spectrum at a wavelength of 0.68 microns into two bands.  The resulting two-band approach in the FSCK formalism requires only 15 quadrature points per atmospheric layer. This represents a 40 -90% reduction in computation time relative to existing correlated k-distribution models.\n\nThe two-band FSCK approach is developed for general atmospheric conditions through the use of tabulated gas k-values, with nongray cloud absorption coefficients added on-the-fly. A two-part evaluation of the FSCK calculations is presented. First, the two-band FSCK results are compared with line-by-line (LBL) benchmarks alongside results from an earlier radiative transfer model intercomparison study. The median of 24 1-D models included in the intercomparison has a clear-sky mean bias error of -0.27 K/day relative to LBL benchmark heating rates, while the operational FSCK model has a mean bias error of +0.04 K/day. In a second set of calculations, two-band FSCK results are compared with those from six popular state-of-the-art operational and research radiative transfer models.  The clear-sky RMS heating rate errors for three empirically-based models range from 0.78 to 6.28 K/day, while RMS errors for three correlated k-distribution models range from 0.85 to 2.83 K/day.  For the same clear-sky case the FSCK RMS error is 0.57 K/day. Cloudy-sky cases show that the correlated k-distribution models overestimate in-cloud heating, while the FSCK approach with nongray cloud absorption is closer to the benchmark.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1565], "author_name_tesi": "Pawlak, Daniel Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Pawlak", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "David R Stauffer", "Jerry Y Harrington", "Michael F Modest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Chair", "David R Stauffer, Committee Member", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "Michael F Modest, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shortwave", "Correlated k-distribution", "FSCK", "radiative transfer", "numerical weather prediction"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Post-Fire Forest Succession, Group-Gap Dynamics, and Implications for Fire Resilience in an Old-Growth Pinus ponderosa Forest", "id": "15175ncp6", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15175", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research quantifies forest structure and examines how post-fire succession alters pine-oak composition, group-gap spatial structure, and wildfire resilience in an old-growth ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest that was resilient to recent wildfires and exhibits a heterogeneous forest structure thought to be similar to forests before fire exclusion. To quantify forest structure and spatial patterns, trees were aged, mapped, and measured in the year 2000 \u2013 six-years after a wildfire \u2013 and in 2016 \u2013 22-years post-fire \u2013 in six, 1-hectare, stem map plots in the Beaver Creek Pinery, located in the Ishi Wilderness, Southern Cascades, California. Regeneration \u2013 seedlings and saplings \u2013 were tallied in 10x10m cells. Rates of tree recruitment, mortality, and growth for the site\u2019s two co-dominant species \u2013 ponderosa pine and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) were estimated using demographic models. Local patterns in group structure was quantified using spatial clump algorithms and gap area was quantified using the empty space function. Potential fire behavior and effects were modeled for a range of fuel and weather conditions.\nStand density and basal area in both 2000 and 2016 were within the historical range of variability for pre-fire exclusion ponderosa pine forests. Initially, wildfire promoted California black oak; however, oak abundance and regeneration has declined while pine abundance and regeneration has increased in the subsequent 22 years without fire. In 2000, ~15% of trees were classified as individuals and tree group sizes ranged from 2 to 75 trees. Small tree groups (2-4 trees) consist of similar-aged trees while larger groups are multi-aged. In 2016, the percent of trees classified as individuals decreased by ~30%, and the scale and intensity of clustering increased. The greatest change in spatial patterns occurred in plots with the highest rates of post-fire recruitment. The size and frequency of canopy gaps was similar in 2000 and 2016; however, higher densities of seedlings and saplings were associated with canopy gaps in 2016 which suggests, without future fire, canopy gaps will be infilled. Fire behavior models indicate the Beaver Creek Pinery is still resilient to high severity wildfire. Overall, this research broadens our understanding on the persistent effects of fire on spatial heterogeneity and demonstrates that wildfires can be used to restore resiliency to forests where wildfires have been suppressed for nearly a century.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16808], "author_name_tesi": "Pawlikowski, Natalie Carmen", "last_name_ssi": "Pawlikowski", "middle_name_ssi": "Carmen", "first_name_ssi": "Natalie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Robert P Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor, Thesis Advisor", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Robert P Brooks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Forest structure", "Group-Gap", "Forest Development", "Wildfire Resilience", "Pinus ponderosa", "Quercus kelloggii"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Autonomous Motion of Catalytic Nanoparticles\n", "id": "7188", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6504", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, I explore and discuss a system that uses the platinum catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to induce interfacial effects that result in the autonomous motion of micro-/nanosized particles.

With the increasing concerns over environmental degradation, legislative compliance, diminishing supply of raw materials, and consumer demands for eco-friendly products, companies have begun designing the traditional supply chain paths to form a closed loop to facilitate recycling and reuse of product returns. The integration of forward and reverse supply chains is termed as Closed Loop Supply Chains (CLSC). Largely driven by its profitable business propositions, CLSC practices help to achieve both financial success and environmental benefits. Given that the annual estimate of commercial returns in the US is in excess of $100 billion and huge potential for using the value in the returned products, this dissertation develops optimization models for the design of a CLSC network for commercial returns by explicitly considering the various aspects of product returns, refurbishing costs, and customer acceptance of refurbished products.\nWe first consider a four stage CLSC network for a single product incorporating customer acceptance rate for refurbished products. We develop an optimization model, called the Base model, to determine the optimal locations of the facilities and the distribution of flows between the facilities in the CLSC to maximize the total profit and illustrate it using a realistic example. The results from the sensitivity analysis show that the total supply chain profit increases with the increase in refurbishing activity. The changes in product return parameters lead to changes in the optimal network design, implying the need to explicitly consider the uncertainty in these return parameters. We also observe that the refurbishing cost has an effect on the network design decisions implying the need to include it in the model. \nQuality of product returns vary depending upon how long the product has been in use, nature of defects, shipping damages etc. In this research, we consider four tiers of product returns, based on the quality of returned products and their refurbishing costs. Buying behaviour of the quality-sensitive high-end customers and price-sensitive low-end customers vary with respect to the price of the refurbished products. We extend our Base model considering the four tiers of product returns, their quality and the customer behaviour towards buying refurbished products. It is called the Extended Base model. We show that the inclusion of the tiers of product returns and customer behaviour towards buying refurbished product increase the supply chain profit. Using sensitivity analysis, we show that the quality of the returned products is an important factor in determining the optimal discount rates for the refurbished products. We also show that the network design varies with the customer acceptance rates of the refurbished products. \nNetwork design models are intrinsically multi-objective in nature. The Extended Base model is reformulated with two objectives: maximize profit and minimize energy usage in the warehousing facilities and transportation. We develop a bi-criteria MILP model for the problem and illustrate it using a realistic example. An interactive optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the bi-criteria problem. The algorithm poses less cognitive burden on the decision maker and converges faster to the best compromise solution. \nProduct return parameters, customer demands, and customer acceptance of the refurbished products, are unpredictable. We model these uncertainties using a set of discrete scenarios with associated probabilities. A scenario-based robust optimization model is then developed to maximize the expected profit of the supply chain along with minimizing the variability of the profit across the scenarios. Minimizing the variability is necessary to mitigate the risk associated with the uncertain input parameters in the supply chain. The model is illustrated with an example. We provide a comparison between the robust optimal solution and the deterministic design solution. We show that the expected profit and the customer responsiveness are higher in the robust design compared to its deterministic counterpart.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9801], "author_name_tesi": "Pazhani, Subramanian ", "last_name_ssi": "Pazhani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Subramanian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Akhil Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Dissertation Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Akhil Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["closed loop supply chains", "refurbishing", "recycling", "network design", "mathematical modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Well-Being of Children Living with Ethnically Heterogamous Parents\n", "id": "9435", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3092", "abstract_tesi": "The percentage of children living with parents of differing ethnicities has risen considerably within recent few decades.

The research found that learning, as informed by the field of adult education, was present across various levels of the experience of these volunteers.  The role of learning was evident in the desire of the adults to ensure learning among the youth enrolled in the program, learning was identified in the outdoor aspects of the Scouting program, and learning was discussed by the participants regarding the social aspects as these adults served in their volunteer capacity.\n     The study concluded through an analysis of the responses of the participants that these volunteers expressed the need to be proficient in their volunteer role.  The Boy Scouts of America provides their volunteers the opportunity for learning through training, meetings, publications, and an on-line learning center.

Surprisingly, there is a substantial lack of research into both the factors that shape student loan debt accumulation and the consequences of that debt throughout the life course.  This dissertation provides insight into these questions by presenting three related chapters on student loan debt, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY-97). Results from the first study indicate that financial contributions from family for educational expenses have the power to shape student loan usage.  The effect of family aid is complex, and the direction and strength of the effect vary depending on several factors.  In general, family gifts can serve to reduce the likelihood that students will take out student loans, provided that the family gifts received are large enough.  The second study explores this relationship further, finding that the extent to which family gifts are able to prevent student loan usage varies depending on socioeconomic status, with wealthier students receiving greater benefits from family gifts.  Family gifts do not explain much of the effect of parental socioeconomic status on the likelihood of taking out student loans, however, indicating that parental resources work in both direct and indirect ways to shape student loan debt. The third study turns to an examination of the consequences of student loan debt for young adults, finding that high levels of student loan debt increase the likelihood that young adults will live with roommates at age 25 rather than living independently; increase the likelihood that young adults will return to live with parents after initially moving out; and decrease the likelihood of early homeownership.  Overall, these results underscore the potential for student loan debt to negatively affect students as they transition to adulthood and emphasize the importance of socioeconomic status and direct family aid as determinants of those who carry the cost of their college education beyond graduation and into adulthood, and those who do not.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10877], "author_name_tesi": "Pearson, Katherine E", "last_name_ssi": "Pearson", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Hardy", "Molly Martin", "Marylee Carmel Taylor", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Hardy, Dissertation Advisor", "Molly Martin, Committee Member", "Marylee Carmel Taylor, Committee Member", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Student loan debt", "family aid", "transition to adulthood", "NLSY", "young adults"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Parent Ratings of Youth Behavior in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago on the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents: Parent Edition\n", "id": "7845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3333", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined parent ratings of youth behavior in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago using the Adjustment Scales for Children and Adolescents: Parent Edition (ASCA: P).

Compared to European-American women, African-American women have a substantially greater risk of preterm birth, low birth weight neonates, and infant mortality.  A variety of factors have been hypothesized to contribute to disparities in these complex pregnancy phenotypes including environment, lifestyle, and genetics.  This dissertation investigates genetic ancestry and the role of genes in contributing to risk of poor pregnancy outcomes among African-American women.\n\tIn the first portion of this research the association between West African genomic ancestry and birth weight and the association between genomic ancestry, skin pigmentation, and serum vitamin D level were investigated.  Increasing West African ancestry was found to be significantly associated with lower birth weight in female neonates and was inversely correlated with serum vitamin D level.  \n\tFor the next phase of this project, admixture mapping was used to identify novel regions of the genome that are associated with preterm birth due to preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).  In this case-control analysis of African-American neonates, regions on five chromosomes (5, 8, 11, 19, and 21) were identified to be associated with increased risk. These regions provide areas for future research into the genetic contributions to risk of preterm birth due to PPROM.\n\tIn the final portion of this research, 90 previously reported preterm birth candidate genes were tested for signatures of accelerated evolution.  Using three test statistics in the parental populations that contribute to African-American admixture, European and West African, forty-four of the preterm birth candidate genes had evidence of non-neutral evolution.  This analysis helped prioritize genes that are more likely to contribute to the increased risk of preterm birth in African-American women compared to European-American women. \n\tFuture work will include a replication of the admixture mapping study to refine the chromosomal regions found to be associated with risk of preterm birth due to PPROM.  Additionally, genotyping of the forty-four preterm birth candidate genes nominated by the three tests for accelerated evolution is planned to look for risk alleles that contribute to the disparity in preterm birth among African-American women. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7428], "author_name_tesi": "Pearson, Laurel ", "last_name_ssi": "Pearson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Laurel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Shriver", "David John Vandenbergh", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Nina G Jablonski", "Jerome Strauss Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Shriver, Dissertation Advisor", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Member", "Jerome Strauss Iii, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Preterm Birth", "Admixture Mapping", "Accelerated Evolution", "African American", "PPROM", "Health Disparities"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Why Bother?: The Nature of Women\u2019s Implicit Theories About the Malleability of Men\u2019s Attitudes", "id": "7193", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4628", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Four studies are presented that examine the influence of women\u2019s beliefs about the changeability of men\u2019s sexist attitudes.

This project initiates the bridging of the two lines of\nresearch by representing mediation and external support in the same agent-based computational\nmodel. Two questions motivate my dissertation. First, I explore the effect of external\nsupport on war duration by simulating the underlying bargaining process in the conflictual\nand peaceful interactions of a multi-player international system. The empirical research on\nexternal support in conflict has had inconsistent results. I follow previous research in assuming that third parties choose to reinforce either side when it can make a difference in the outcome, which means support is never given to those belligerents that can win regardless. Given that third parties in my model observe the behavior of supporters for the opposing side, I also derive that support is more likely to be given when one's protege's opponent receives support. This in turn implies that support\non average makes wars longer because it is meant to alter the outcome of the conflict. In\ndeparture from previous research, my model also accounts for the presence of power mediators\nwho may impose prohibitive costs on the belligerents and may make the provided support\nirrelevant. Finally, my model also yields that support may alter the calculus of belligerents\nduring the conflict of interests stage, preventing the conflict from escalating to violence in\nthe first place. Therefore, the effect of support on conflict duration is bimodal: preventing\nthe onset and prolonging those armed conflicts that have started.\n\nSecond, I focus on the effect of power mediation (i.e., a mediation style that exerts\npressure on the belligerents) on peace duration. Power mediation is the most effective mediation\nstyle at achieving ceasefires. This finding may have important policy implications: the\nmore pressure mediators put on the belligerents the more likely they are to precipitate peace.\nHowever, power mediation may also reduce the duration of cease\fre that follows, which implies that third parties may sacrifice long-term peace stability for the sake of short-term benefits of an unstable ceasefire. I demonstrate that the actual effect of power mediation\non ceasefire survival is more nuanced and should be analyzed in concert with the actions\nof support-providing third parties. First, if powerful mediators stop inflating the costs of fighting the conflict of interest and armed conflict may indeed recur in my model, as previous\nscholarship argues. However, this dynamic takes place in those cases that receive no external\nsupport. When reinforcement is large enough to eliminate uncertainty over who is going to\nwin the war, my model yields that a peaceful transfer of resources to the dissatisfied belligerent\nwill take place. In contrast, in those cases when reinforcements are only large enough\nto recreate conflicts of interests but do not remove uncertainty, an initially fragile ceasefire\nmay become even more prone to conflict recurrence than previously argued. Therefore, the\neffect of power mediation on ceasefire duration depends heavily on the behavior of support\nproviding third-parties.\n\nThe flexibility of computer programming to accommodate a finite number of heterogeneous\nactors and my focus on individual-level decisions make agent-based modeling a suitable\ntool for hypotheses development in this project. I build a benchmark agent-based model of\nintra-war and post-war bargaining in the world without third parties in chapter 2 and an\nextended model with mediating and support-providing third parties in chapter 4. One of the disadvantages of computational models is that parameter spaces are often prohibitively large\nto generate and analyze exhaustively. This results in scholars often ignoring the boundary\nconditions for a model's parameters and non-systematically derived conclusions. I introduce\na systematic way to interpret agent-based models by interfacing a genetic algorithm search\nprogram with simulation models, conceptualizing numerical output from a simulation model\nas a fitness function of the genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms do not need to create an\nexhaustive parameter space to find global solutions, and therefore users are able to explore\ntheir models more quickly, yet systematically. The software program SimGA is presented in\nchapter 3 and verified by recreating the logic underlying the benchmark model of chapter 2.\nI also use this program to analyze the extended model in chapter 4.\n\nFinally, I use observational data to test empirically some of the extended model's\nimplications in chapter 5. I test for effect of external support on war duration against a\nsample of civil wars and find support for my model's implications. With respect to external\nsupport shaping peace duration, in the sample of interstate ceasefires, external support\nprecipitates conflict when it recreates uncertainty and stabilizes peace when it eliminates\nuncertainty.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9140], "author_name_tesi": "Pechenkina, Anna O", "last_name_ssi": "Pechenkina", "middle_name_ssi": "O", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Douglas William Lemke", "Philip A Schrodt", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Bennett Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "Philip A Schrodt, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mediation", "reinforcement", "agent-based model", "conflict management", "genetic algorithms", "parameter space", "third-party intervention."]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Neurobiology of Violence and Trauma: Understanding the Consequences of Early Life Adversity Through the Study of Sex Differences in Environment and Perception", "id": "19908", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9454", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The neurobiology of violence and trauma was studied to provide support for a context-sex differences model of maltreated and nonmaltreated youth. Specifically, the three reports presented in this dissertation examine the short- and long-term effects of exposure to violent and traumatic experiences and perception of abuse on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and internalizing and externalizing behavior problems during childhood and adolescence.  Sex differences were considered as males and females are thought to differ in their biobehavioral response to stress (Taylor et al., 2000) and in the manifestation of health and behavior problems related to severe and chronic stress exposure (Klein & Corwin, 2002).  The first study is a critical review of the stress literature pertaining to HPA axis function in children and adolescents, with the purpose of highlighting differences in HPA axis function between males and females in the context (e.g., community violence, maltreatment) in which children and adolescents develop.  The second report assessed adaptation and calibration of the stress response system by examining the association between recent exposure to violent and traumatic experiences and cortisol reactivity over time in maltreated and nonmaltreated youth.  The third report tested hypotheses regarding whether maltreated children's perception of abuse as their most upsetting experience was associated with the development of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems and HPA axis function in males and females, separately.  The aims of these studies are to consider exogenous (e.g., environmental) and endogenous (e.g., sex, perception) factors that may explain inconsistencies in the stress literature and why some children and adolescents are resilient in the face of adversity.  Data for the second and third reports were provided by the Young Adolescent Project (YAP), a longitudinal study that followed an ethnically diverse sample of maltreated (n=303) and nonmaltreated (n=151) children and adolescents over four waves of measurement.  The studies that provided data for Reports 1 and 2 were funded by the National Institute of Child Health (NICHD) and the National Institute of Drug Abuse (Penelope K. Trickett, PI).

The high-resolution backbone structure of the WW domain from human\npeptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (hPin1) was used as input into an algorithm\ndeveloped previously for the generation of amino acid sequences compatible with a given\nbackbone geometry (Sequence Prediction Algorithm, or SPA). Various weights of\nprotein folding parameters such as hydrophobic burial, hydrophilic exposure, electrostatic\ninteractions, Lennard-Jones potential and side chain torsional energy were applied for the\nselection of a sequence of amino acids which, when placed on the target experimental\nbackbone in the predicted conformations, resulted in a native-like protein model in terms\nof packing, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic and hydrophilic patterning, and other\nnecessary criteria. One protein sequence was chosen for experimental characterization to\nassess the usefulness of SPA in selecting a primary structure compatible with the wildtype\nWW fold. A synthetic gene for this protein was cloned into a previously developed\nplasmid using standard molecular biology techniques. Although expression was achieved\nto a high level as a fusion system with the N-terminus of calmodulin, difficulties in\npurifying the protein product using a variety of modern techniques prevented the\nstructural analysis of the material, and a different approach to the design was adopted.\nTo avoid the summary rejection of sequences on the basis of a few minor steric\nclashes during the process of computational design, backbone flexibility was\nimplemented to relieve potential strains. Flexibility was mimicked through the\napplication of a Monte Carlo algorithm, which allowed for random movements in the\n(?,?) space of the wild-type backbone. These manipulations produced an ensemble of\nbackbones, all of which had a root mean squared deviation <0.3 \u00c5 to the wild-type\nbackbone. Each of these backbones in the ensemble was used as input into SPA; the\nresult was a free energy matrix of each allowed amino acid and its rotamers, which was\nused to determine the probability of occurrence of an amino acid and rotamer\ncombination in the lowest-energy sequence. This new method was referred to as SPANS\nfor Sequence Prediction Algorithm on Numerous States. Three promising sequences of\n36 amino acids were chosen to test the power of the improved algorithm. The\ncorresponding proteins were prepared with standard molecular biology methods, again as\nfusion systems with the N-terminus of calmodulin. Circular dichroism (CD) data\nindicated the presence of a WW-like target fold in one of the designed proteins (referred\nto as SPANS-WW2) via positive ellipticity centered on ~230 nm. Others have identified\nthis feature as a characteristic of the CD spectrum of wild-type WW domains, although in\nthe instance of the WW domain from hPin1, the wild-type protein utilized in this study,\nthe signal is stronger. The positive ellipticity of SPANS-WW2 increased in intensity\ntwo-fold after the sample was heated to 95 \u00b0C for five minutes at pH 7 and subsequently\ncooled ? a process referred to as annealing. Additionally, a single mutation in the wildtype\nWW domain (W29A) yielded a protein with a positive ellipticity comparable to that\nof the SPANS-WW2 designed protein. These observations suggested that the reduction\nin CD signal was due to interactions between the solvent-exposed tryptophan and the\naromatic amino acids located near this residue, rather than backbone conformation. The\nspecificity of the SPANS-WW2 fold was confirmed by initial 1D and 2D proton NMR\nspectroscopy, which indicated the presence of the target WW-like fold. However, the\nthermal stability of the designed protein was decreased compared to that of the wild-type\nWW, as shown by CD thermal denaturation and 1D variable temperature NMR\nspectroscopy. Efforts towards the characterization of the other two proteins designed by\nthe SPANS method yielded a limited amount of success according to CD data. SPANS\nhighlighted several potentially useful point mutations in these two designed proteins;\nonly one of the mutations increased the presence of a WW-type fold as evidenced by\nslight changes in the CD signature. The ability to identify interesting or useful point\nmutations increased the efficacy of the SPANS algorithm in the design of a protein that\nhas high specificity for a target fold.\nThis work provides strong experimental evidence of the success of the algorithm\nin selecting for a sequence that adopted and maintained a ?-sheet fold with marginal\nstability. As most previous attempts at protein design have focused on proteins that were\nentirely or primarily ?-helical, this success is especially noteworthy.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1067], "author_name_tesi": "Pecore, Christina M.

There are numerous examples of studies that have investigated the influence of local and regional climates, intra- and interspecific competition for limiting resources as well as predation. Recently, increased attention has been devoted to the effects of climate change on species distributions, abundance and community composition. Plants have been shown to respond to climate change in various ways. For instance, primary production, phenological progression, reproduction as well as plant community composition have all been shown to respond to a changing climate. However, herbivory has also been shown to have strong impact on plants and plant communities. But, the influence of herbivory has been excluded from the majority of published studies on climate change and the effects on ecosystem properties. This may have led to inaccurate predictions about how ecosystems respond to climate change. The Arctic is expected to experience the earliest and most pronounced changes due to increasing global temperatures. My research was conducted in a low-arctic ungulate grazing system in West-Greenland occupied by large ungulate grazers like caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). The goal of this research was to investigate the influence of herbivory on how arctic vegetation responds to a warmer climate.\n\tTwelve pairs of permanent vegetation plots were randomly selected inside and outside of herbivore exclosures in 2003. An open top chamber (OTC) was randomly assigned to each pair of permanent plots, to simulate climate warming. I investigated the influence of ungulate herbivory on the biomass production of arctic vegetation to simulated climate warming. By the use of the non-destructive point-intercept method (PIM) I acquired a biomass index that was converted to biomass values. By monitoring changes in aboveground biomass from 2003 until 2006 I investigated the potential effect of climate warming on plant biomass production in an arctic grazing system. I did not find any strong evidence of climate warming effects on the aboveground plant biomass production. Neither did I find any strong effects of ungulate herbivory on plant production although there was indications that large herbivores could mitigate the predicted increase in shrub biomass over graminoids and forbs. However, the effect of my treatments was probably concealed by intense caterpillar foraging during a population outbreak of the moth Eurois occulta in 2004 and 2005 that severely affected above ground biomass in the study area.\n\tIn a related study, I investigated the effects of climate warming and ungulate herbivory on plant community composition and the abundance of shrubs, graminoids and forbs. By converting plant intercepts from the PIM to vegetation cover values, I monitored changes in abundance from 2003 until 2006. The intent was to investigate if ungulate herbivores could mitigate the predicted increasing dominance of shrubs in the Arctic as a response to a warmer climate.  I did not detect any significant changes in the abundance of shrubs, graminoids or forbs to either the warming treatment or exclosure treatment. But, there appeared to be higher abundance of shrubs where ungulate herbivores were excluded and higher abundance of graminoids in grazed areas, suggesting potential negative effect of ungulates on shrub dominance. However, the lack of responses observed in plant abundance to the treatments was most likely affected by the caterpillar outbreak during 2004 and 2005.\n\tClimate warming has been shown to affect plant reproduction. Also, theory suggests that if herbivory is predictable in time and space, plants have the ability to compensate for tissue lost. Several plant species have been shown to compensate for tissue lost to herbivory. I investigated the possible influence of ungulate herbivory and climate warming on the flower and fruit production of two co-occurring forb species, Cerastium alpinum and Draba cana. The objective was to investigate potential compensatory responses in these two forbs species to grazing exposure and climate warming that could lead to changes in interspecific competition. Forty eight ramets from each species were permanently marked in the vegetation plots. Biometric measurements were performed on each ramet throughout the growth season. Results indicate a reduced reproductive success in D. cana to climate warming when exposed to herbivory while C. alpinum experienced increased reproductive success when compared to ramets in plots excluded from herbivory. This suggests that climate warming could affect the competitive outcome between plant species and hence affect future community composition.\n\tFinally, I investigated the effects of climate warming and ungulate herbivory on plant emergence and phenological progression of arctic plants during the 2004 and 2005 growth seasons. Higher air and soil temperatures have been shown to advance plant emergence and the phenological progression of arctic and alpine plants. It has also been shown that plants have the ability to compensate loss of tissue to herbivores by compensatory growth. However, such allocation of resources to compensatory growth responses has been suggested to delay phenological progression. By monitoring plant emergence and phenological progression of plants in the permanent vegetation plots in 2004 and 2005, I investigated if herbivory could mitigate an advanced phenological progression of arctic plants as a response to climate warming. In 2004, the results indicated that a warmer climate advances the emergence of arctic plants. Furthermore, ungulate herbivory delayed plant emergence, but it appeared that the plants compensated a later emergence with a faster phenological progression. However, during the caterpillar outbreak in 2005, the relationships found in 2004 were offset by severe plant defoliation that caused fewer plant species to emerge during that year.\n\tThe results found in this study did not find sufficient evidence that climate warming and the effects of herbivory have strong influence on aboveground plant production or plant community composition. However, the outbreak of the moth E. occulta severely affected aboveground biomass and plant cover and most likely concealed any treatment effects from the experiment. However, effects of both climate warming simulations and ungulate herbivory significantly affected plant reproduction, plant emergence and phenological progression. Based on the findings in this study, it is strongly advised that the influence of herbivory should be taken into account when effort is made to make prediction about how plants respond to a changing climate.\n\tThroughout the development of my dissertation work, I have been involved in and contributed to research closely related to the issues investigated in this thesis.

This included coordinate transformations of model geometries to coincide with crystallographic orientations known to generate Surface Skimming Bulk Waves (SSBW) and various Rayleigh wave types of propagation in ST Quartz, 900 rotated ST Quartz, and 770 Y rotated Lithium Tantalate.

Rayleigh damping properties were extended to develop a Finite element model capable of predicting Layered SAW response to glass transition in a polymer film.  \n\n\tThe ability to monitor localized mechanical behavior in a PMMA film was explored with Love Waves generated by 900 rotated ST Quartz and Shear Vertical (SV)-SAWs generated by 770 Y rotated Lithium Tantalate.  Similar trends were found experimentally as compared to the Finite element models.  The capability of Love Wave devices for monitoring polymer film curing behavior was investigated.  The ability to qualitatively asses the bond quality between film and substrate was also demonstrated based on the characteristics of the transmitted frequency response.  The results of these developments have laid the ground work for developing diagnostic tools to better characterize film behavior in practical applications\n\n\tSeveral sensor applications for Layered SAW devices were discussed.  The Shear Horizontal displacement of the Love Wave device was exploited to demonstrate the capability of such a sensor for ice detection.  A clear distinction between air, water, and ice loading was found with Love Waves whereas SV-SAWs were unable to distinguish between liquid and ice loading.  The concept of a Layered SAW radiation sensor based on ion modification of a polymer film was presented for the first time.  A Finite element model based on published experimental modification data was presented and validated experimentally with the UV cross-linking of an SU-8 photoresist film.

In this study, an amine functionalized solid sorbent has been developed based on commercially available fumed silica as a support. The fumed silica based sorbent was estimated to be ~30 times cheaper than the MBS2 while it displayed properties similar in terms of gravimetric capacity and adsorption rates, and an improved volumetric capacity. A lower stability over multiple regeneration cycles was observed. A preliminary study of the heat requirements for regeneration also showed a significant improvement of the MBS2 and fumed silica supported sorbents over conventional amine scrubbing. \nThis study also addresses the kinetic behavior of the two sorbents evaluating the Avrami and the Lagergren models to fit the experimental data and determine the characteristic kinetic parameters. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1907], "author_name_tesi": "Peduzzi, Emanuela ", "last_name_ssi": "Peduzzi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Emanuela", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Thesis Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CO2 capture", "solid sorbent"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Design of a Shape Selective Platinum-carbon Catalyst with High Effectiveness  ", "id": "20116", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9627", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polyfurfuryl alcohol forms an amorphous non-graphitizing carbon upon pyrolysis at temperatures higher than 600 \u00b0C. This carbon is inherently microporous with the average pore size of 0.5 nm. The mean pore size and total porosity of PFA-derived carbon can be shifted and enhanced using different techniques either during polymerization (adding pore forming agents) or after carbonization (oxidation using CO2). The narrow pore size distribution which is a unique characteristic of this carbon, provides selective adsorptive properties and hence size and shape selectivity. Mass transport of bulky and non-planar molecules is significantly hindered within the slit-like ultra micropores of PFA-derived carbon. Because of having large surface area and high thermal and chemical stability, PFA-derived carbon can be utilized in a wide variety of applications such as gas separation, catalysis and energy storage.\nHeterogeneous catalysis is one of the most promising areas in which carbon offers several advantages. High hydrothermal stability and inert surface chemistry of PFA-derived carbon grant its long active life under harsh reaction conditions such as extremely high or low pH. On the other hand, shape selective catalysts with much higher sintering resistance compared to conventional impregnated catalysts, could be synthesized by embedding active metal nanoparticles within the carbon microstructure. These catalysts selectively convert those molecules that are able to diffuse into the pores, or promote the reaction in specific pathways that lead to the formation of molecules which are able to diffuse out. Due to the clean surface of the carbon pores, undesired side reactions, which are the main reason for decreased selectivity on zeolite-based catalysts, are avoided. However, engineering the textural and morphological properties of PFA-derived carbon (catalyst support) is the main challenge on the way to commercialization of these types of shape selective catalysts. In this study, based on the well-known fundamentals of heterogeneous catalysis, practical approaches are developed and utilized in order to design the optimum catalyst for liquid phase hydrogenation reactions. \nAn emulsion polymerization approach using pluronic F-127 as the structure-directing agent and furfuryl alcohol as the monomer was utilized to prepare poly(furfuryl alcohol) spheres. Upon pyrolysis at 800 \u00b0C, the spheres transform to microporous carbon. By controlling the polymerization conditions, the diameter of the spheres, hence the diffusion length could be varied. Carbon spheres with the average size of a few microns all the way down to 50 nm were synthesized.  In next step, platinum nanoparticles were embedded within the microstructure of the carbon spheres through emulsion polymerization of furfuryl alcohol in the presence of pre-formed Pt nanoparticles.  The synthesized embedded catalyst was evaluated in liquid phase hydrogenation of linear and branched alkenes and showed high selectivity towards hydrogenation of smaller linear alkenes compared to larger and more branched ones. To improve the embedded catalyst activity, diffusion length, total porosity and average pore size were varied by varying the emulsion polymerization parameters, using pore forming agents and selective oxidation of carbon in CO2 stream. Catalyst activity was improved by more than one order of magnitude by optimizing the morphological and textural properties of the carbon support.\nThe experimental catalysis data were analyzed and modeled with a transient reaction-diffusion equation within the ultramicropores, in order to obtain kinetic, adsorption and diffusion parameters. The results showed that those reactions that are happening within the confined spaces of the pores are significantly different from the reactions occurring on the outer surface of a supported conventional catalyst. The force field of the pore walls and the steric hindrance imposed by micropores, stabilize the molecules and increase the adsorption equilibrium constants and reaction rate constants. As the molecule size and bulkiness increases, the effect of confinement becomes more pronounced. It was shown that intrinsic forward reaction rate constant for 2-methyl-1-pentene hydrogenation within the micropores is almost one order of magnitude larger than it is for the same reaction over the supported catalyst. \nIn order to tailor carbon-based catalysts for reactions that involve bulkier molecules, such as poly-aromatic hydrocarbons or biomass-derived chemicals, the presence of mesoporosity is essential to lower the mass transfer limitation imposed by the microporous nature of the carbons. In this study, a simple one step method that can be used to synthesize a carbon with a bimodal pore size distribution is presented. Simultaneous polymerization of furfuryl alcohol and phloroglucinol-formaldehyde in the presence of a structure directing agent (Pluronic F-127) was carried out and the resultant polymer was pyrolyzed to yield the bimodal carbon. The mean micro and mesopore size in this carbon could be varied by varying the surfactant and acid concentrations and monomer composition.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9388], "author_name_tesi": "Peer Lachegurabi, Maryam ", "last_name_ssi": "Peer Lachegurabi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maryam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Professpr Henry C Foley", "Professpr Henry C Foley", "Darrell Velegol", "Andrew Zydney", "Chunshan Song"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Professpr Henry C Foley, Dissertation Advisor", "Professpr Henry C Foley, Committee Chair", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoporous carbon", "heterogeneous catalysis", "Emulsion polymerization", "Platinum nanoparticles", "liquid phase hydrogenation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Three Essays In International Trade and Industrial Organization", "id": "12299", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "323", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three chapters. Chapter 1: International Trade and Supply Function Competition: Model and Non-\nparametric Identi&#133;cation (with Quang H.Vuong)\nThis chapter introduces a novel model of international trade in which exporters\ncompete in supply functions/schedules and studies the nonparametric identi&#133;ca-\ntion of the underlying structure, namely productivity distributions and marginal\ncosts. In recent Ricardian and heterogeneous &#133;rm models of international trade,\nprobabilistic representations of technologies have been very popular. Using a\nsimilar setup, we propose a model in which exporters compete in supply func-\ntions/schedules. Our model reconciles the existence of multiple sellers, multiple\nprices, and variable markups while also incorporating features such as strategic\npricing and incomplete information. Moreover, the probabilistic structure in trade\nmodels usually comes with strong parametric assumptions on the productivity dis-\ntributions (usually assumed to be Fr\u00e9chet or Pareto) of countries/&#133;rms. Recent\nstudies have shown that gains from trade predictions are very sensitive to these\nparametrizations. In view of this, our model maintains a flexible structure for\nproductivity distributions and marginal costs. We recover the productivity distri-\nbutions and the marginal cost functions nonparametrically. Our methodology also\ncontributes to the empirical share auction literature by showing that the underly-\ning structure is identi&#133;ed nonparametrically even if we do not observe the entire\nschedules, but only the transaction point instead. Chapter 2: International Trade and Supply Function Competition: An Empirical\nApplication (with Quang H.Vuong)\nThis chapter provides an empirical application of the supply function compe-\ntition model of international trade that was introduced in the previous chapter.\nBased on the identi&#133;cation results of the previous chapter, we propose a non-\nparametric estimation procedure and obtain nonparametric estimates of the pro-\nductivity distributions and marginal costs. We apply the model to the German\nmarket for manufacturing imports for 1990. Our empirical results do not support\nthe distributional assumptions that are commonly made in the international trade\nliterature such as Fr\u00e9chet and Pareto. In particular, we &#133;nd that the productivity\ndistributions are not unimodal. Low productivities are more likely to occur as ex-\npected, but there is not a single mode. In addition, our results show that markups\nare not constant across exporters.

In contrast to the generally modest findings in the absence of child risk, findings in the presence of risk were notably more powerful.  Although maternal anxiety during early childhood appeared associated with later child anxious symptoms regardless of risk status, only in the presence of risk was a mechanism of effect able to be identified.  More specifically, a lack of positive parenting behaviors mediated the relations between maternal anxiety in early childhood and later child anxiety in the presence of child risk.

The ability to manipulate materials at the nanometer scale through lithographic techniques such as electron-beam lithography has made it possible to generate higher density integrated circuits.  Nanoscale wires, known as nanowires, have also been created using template-assisted synthesis and vapor-liquid-solid growth techniques.  In order to design devices using these nanoscale structures, methods for analyzing these structures need to be developed.  The methods developed for device analysis must also incorporate the behavior of materials at the infrared and optical frequencies.  This thesis will develop models for analyzing nanowires in the infrared and optical spectrum by examining scattering from semiconducting nanowires and developing surface impedance models for inclusion to the method of moments.\n\n\nThe dispersive nature of metals and semiconductors at infrared and optical wavelengths is introduced into our modeling approaches using oscillator models.  The oscillator model that was used in this work is the Lorentz-Drude oscillator model.  The Lorentz-Drude oscillator model was used to represent the dielectric properties of metals such as gold and silver in the infrared and optical spectrum.  Oscillator models do not exist for all materials.  Particle swarm optimization was applied to parameter fit a Lorentzian oscillator model for Gallium Phosphide material.  The particle swarm optimization approach is general so that other materials may be parameterized to the Lorentzian model and incorporated into time-domain modeling methods such as the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD).\n\n\nLord Rayleigh first investigated scattering from infinitely long dielectric cylinders in 1918.  The analytical solution technique developed by Rayleigh was used to determine the electric fields inside and outside a long nanowire.  A numeric code was developed to calculate the electric field magnitude inside and outside the wire for a Gallium Phosphide nanowire excited at normal incidence by a transverse magnetic and transverse electric wave.  The intensity integral was introduced for cylindrical geometry and applied to lossless and lossy dielectric nanowires for both transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations.  It was determined that the transverse magnetic polarization is dominant for diameters below 125 nm.  The polarization dependence at normal incidence was also investigated by deriving the internal electric intensity as a function the transverse magnetic and electric polarization intensities and the angle theta.  For diameters where the transverse magnetic intensity dominates, it was determined the intensity has a dipole-like pattern.  These properties agree with experimental data and discrete-dipole approximation calculations.\n\newline\n\newline\nSurface impedance models are of great utility in electromagnetics because they provide an efficient method for representing the material and geometrical properties of a structure without the need for fine meshing.  Surface impedance models for nanoslabs, nanowires and tubular nanowires were studied in this work.  A surface impedance for a variable thickness slab surrounded by free-space was derived.  It was shown that for slabs of large thickness, the surface impedance agrees with the surface impedance of a half-space.  A vanishingly small slab was shown to have the surface impedance of free-space as expected.  The surface impedance expression for a nanowire was examined and it was shown that for larger radii nanowires the surface impedance approaches that of a half-space.  For the tubular nanowire, the surface impedance was derived using modal analysis and compared to an expression developed by King.  It was determined that King's expression yields different results that predict different surface impedance values for small thickness tubular nanowires.  Finally, a method of moments formulation for thin-wire dipole antennas was modified to incorporate a surface impedance model.  Results comparing a perfectly conducting, gold, and silver nano-dipole show the importance of incorporating material properties at infrared and optical frequencies into the electromagnetic analysis of nanostructures.  By developing modeling tools for nanowires, devices may be designed for optical detection and bio-sensing.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4079], "author_name_tesi": "Pellen, Michael Emile", "last_name_ssi": "Pellen", "middle_name_ssi": "Emile", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Pingjuan Li Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Thesis Advisor", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["particle swarm optimization", "electromagnetics", "scattering", "nanowires", "nanotechnology", "method of moments", "material models"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE POWER OF DISCOURSE: \nSILENCING DISSENT THROUGH DEBATE ABOUT\u2026DISSENT\n\n\n", "id": "7256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2540", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reactions to events of the past several years, including the attack on the World Trade Center and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, have reawakened public and academic concern with emancipatory politics, political freedom, and transformative or revolutionary change.  In particular, the anti-war demonstrations raise the question of whether contemporary forms of cultural politics are capable of disruption, or simply reaction.  I use this manifestation of political dissent to engage contemporary and critical theoretical claims about agency and structure, the proper location and shape of politics, and the production of meaning.  \n\nNewspaper coverage of dissent between 2001-03 provides the empirical basis of these case studies, with individual investigations focusing on newspaper articles about dissent, reports on protest events, and letters to the editor about dissent.  Discourse analysis is used to study news media frames about dissent: I reconstruct the discourse about dissent in the context of the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, outlining the major themes used to frame discussion of the political debate between pro-war and peace activists.  Like other studies of protest coverage, this investigation substantiates the conclusion that news coverage tends to focus on event characteristics (violence, arrests, numbers of protesters), radical or fringe elements, features of events (mobilization and logistics) and frequent crowd actions (\u201cwaved signs and chanted\u201d) rather than the substantive claims being made.  I explore the effects and power of these frames, illustrating how the discourse of dissent established certain subject positions (the dissident) as deviant and interacted with powerful post-9/11 rhetoric to reinforce notions of patriotism and unity.  This discursive construction of dissent effectively restricted the space in which debate over war could occur.  Genuine, critical discussions were sidetracked by raising the phantom of dissent as the issue in need of debate.\n\n\u201cLetters\u201d sections of newspapers and magazines served as a valuable link between \u201cofficial\u201d discourse and individual understanding and use of the language of news; they provide a vantage point (though not a perfect one) from which to observe the contentious interactions that take place among individuals (and between individuals and institutions like the newsmedia) throughout the process of discourse formation.  Letters challenged the ultimate primacy and power typically granted to news text.  Although a dominant discourse about dissent was evident in official journalistic accounts, the same is not true of letters: vigorous debate was ongoing.  Nonetheless, letter writers were rarely able to reorient the debate once the parameters were established: readers were not substantially able to critique the discourse about dissent that served as a distraction from real debate over the march to war.\n\nFinally, I examine the representation of protest activities and dissident individuals in reports on protest events in order to understand how the increasing emphasis on \u201cthe visual\u201d and \u201ccultural politics\u201d (including parody, culture jamming, etc.) \u2013 in social theory and in our everyday lives \u2013 impacts the possibility for social transformation.  Through the aestheticization of dissent, political opposition is increasingly trivialized, individualized, rendered ineffective and emptied of meaning in newspaper coverage.  The language and actions of a cultural politics were easily manipulated by journalists, resulting in the cooptation of oppositional messages.

Operating conditions were similar to realistic gas turbine conditions with the exception of mean combustor pressure. Flame response was characterized across a range of frequencies and velocity oscillation magnitudes during self-excited and forced flame investigations.\n\nThe variable-length combustor was used to determine the range of preferred instability frequencies for a given operating condition. Flame stability was classified based on combustor pressure oscillation measurements. Velocity oscillations in the injector barrel were calculated from additional pressure measurements using the two-microphone method. CH* chemiluminescence emission was used to quantify heat release rate. A filtered photomultiplier tube measured global emission and flame structure was characterized using an intensified CCD camera.\n\nSelf-excited and forced global flame responses were compared in the linear and transition into the nonlinear regimes. For cases in this study, the gain and phase between velocity and heat release rate oscillations agreed across a range of velocity oscillation magnitudes, validating the use of forcing measurements to measure flame response to velocity oscillations. Analysis of the self-excited flame response indicated the saturation mechanism responsible for limit-cycle behavior can result from nonlinear driving or damping processes in the combustor.\n\nGlobal flame response to forced velocity oscillations between 100 and 440 Hz was measured over a wide range of operating conditions. Nearly all measurements showed similar qualitative behavior; gain decreased with increasing frequency until reaching a minimum value at a frequency fmin. After reaching a local minimum, gain increased with frequency. The frequency of minimum response fmin varied with operating condition and was found to be related to the mean velocity in the injector and a characteristic flame length determined from stable flame imaging. In addition, the phase between velocity oscillations and heat release rate oscillations scaled with mean velocity and flame length.\n\nThe global response of the flame was separated into acoustic and convective components by modeling the response of the flame to a purely acoustic wavelength velocity oscillation. The phase of the reconstructed convective response was characteristic of a response to a flow disturbance originating from the end of the injector centerbody, the anchoring point of the flame. Phase-synchronized imaging of select flames over a range of frequencies showed global flame response was controlled by the interaction between axial velocity oscillations and vortical disturbances shed from the injector centerbody throughout the flame brush.

This study was grounded in two interconnected theoretical frameworks: critical feminism (also with attention to embodied learning) and women\u2019s emancipatory learning in relation to breastfeeding and activism. \nThere were 11 participants in the study, chosen according to purposeful criteria related to the study\u2019s purpose; they represent diversity in age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, and educational background.  Data collection included narrative semi-structured interviews, which were co-constructed between the researcher and the participants, and researcher-generated artifacts.  Both narrative and constant-comparative analysis were used to analyze the data.  \nThere were three sets of findings that emerged from the data.  First, those related to the marginalization of breastfeeding mothers indicate that their marginalization is manifested in: negative views of breastfeeding in public; lack of breastfeeding support of some health professionals; the commercial formula industry; and returning to employment.  Second, the findings regarding how they learned to be activists indicate they did so: by becoming conscious of marginalization; through mentoring, networking, and collaboration; through sometimes leveraging men\u2019s power and support; and through social media and technology.  Third, the findings regarding what they learned from being activists center on: seeing activism as a continuum; perspective-taking; learning leadership skills; and claiming their own empowerment.    \nThe findings from this study have implications for both theory and practice.  Related to adult learning theory, this study offers new insight into the role of embodied learning as part of women\u2019s activist learning.  The public health field can glean from this study how to better educate women not only on breastfeeding, but also on public health issues in general by fostering collaboration and connection, and adopting insights from feminist pedagogy.  Further, integrating activism and emancipatory learning into the curriculum for health care professionals can help them not only in their efforts at patient education, but in their own activist efforts for healthcare.

The inverted classroom has emerged as an unconventional approach to structuring a classroom environment to enhance active learning. This model allows instructors to provide engaging content but also to cater to different learning styles by reserving significant amounts of classroom time for student interaction and problem solving. Many learning responsibilities are correspondingly shifted to the student, which leads to a sense of autonomy. \nThe implementation of the inverted classroom pedagogy varies depending on the instructor, learning objectives, activities, content, and available teaching resources. Instructors use whatever technologies are provided to enable and complement this pedagogy; however, there has been no effort to analyze or design technologies that would be most appropriate for this teaching method. Instead, instructors turn towards a mix of external technologies, the learning and integration of which detracts from accomplishing other teaching tasks. \nIn my first study, I used qualitative methods to study the practices of instructors using the inverted model, guided by Activity Theory as my theoretical lens. I found a number of themes pointing to a need for more flexibility and customization of the support tools. These early findings have led me to argue for the design of a system that could aid \u201cinverted instructors\u201d with their tasks and as a result help to transform the activity of teaching in this context. \nMy second study was guided by my previous findings and used Scenario-Based Design (SBD) to create low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios that would allow me to explore my preliminary design ideas through participatory design sessions. I shared these design ideas with instructors, and use their feedback to refine my high-level design ideas that in the future will enable me to design and build a concrete artifact. \nIn this thesis I describe the activity analysis and iterative design process that I have followed, drawing from Activity Theory as a lens, and producing design recommendations for technology that can support inverted teaching practices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11145], "author_name_tesi": "Pena, Joslenne ", "last_name_ssi": "Pena", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joslenne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Inverted Classroom", "Flipped Classroom", "Education Technology", "Scenario-based Design"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "TANDEM REPEAT PROTEINS INSPIRED BY SQUID RING TEETH", "id": "14739aup244", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14739", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Proteins are large biomolecules consisting of long chains of amino acids that hierarchically assemble into complex structures, and provide a variety of building blocks for biological materials. The repetition of structural building blocks is a natural evolutionary strategy for increasing the complexity and stability of protein structures. However, the relationship between amino acid sequence, structure, and material properties of protein systems remains unclear due to the lack of control over the protein sequence and the intricacies of the assembly process.\nIn order to investigate the repetition of protein building blocks, a recently discovered protein from squids is examined as an ideal protein system. Squid ring teeth are predatory appendages located inside the suction cups that provide a strong grasp of prey, and are solely composed of a group of proteins with tandem repetition of building blocks. The objective of this thesis is the understanding of sequence, structure and property relationship in repetitive protein materials inspired in squid ring teeth for the first time. Specifically, this work focuses on squid-inspired structural proteins with tandem repeat units in their sequence that are physically cross-linked via \u03b2-sheet structures. The work presented here tests the hypothesis that increasing the number of building blocks in the polypeptide chain decreases the protein network defects and improves the material properties.\nSpectroscopic structural analysis, advanced materials characterization, and entropic elasticity theory are combined to elucidate the structure and properties of these repetitive proteins. This approach is applied not only to native squid proteins but also to squid-inspired synthetic polypeptides that allow for a fine control of the sequence and network morphology. The results provided in this work establish a clear dependence between the repetitive building blocks, the network morphology, and the properties of squid-inspired repetitive protein materials. Increasing the number of tandem repeat units in SRT-inspired proteins led to more effective protein networks with superior properties. These findings introduce new design rules in the engineering of proteins based on tandem repetition and morphology control, and provide a novel framework for optimizing the properties of protein-based materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15837], "author_name_tesi": "Pena Francesch, Abdon ", "last_name_ssi": "Pena Francesch", "first_name_ssi": "Abdon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melik C Demirel", "Melik C Demirel", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melik C Demirel, Dissertation Advisor", "Melik C Demirel, Committee Chair", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["structural proteins", "squid ring teeth", "protein materials", "stretchable conductors", "biomimetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Factor Structure Of Scores from the Conner\u2019 Parent and Teacher Rating Scales \u2013 Revised Among Children In Nepal\n\n", "id": "12379", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3794", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disorder, which is marked by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and has been identified in children throughout the world (Polanczyk & Rohdes, 2007).

Ratings were provided by 1,387 teachers and 1,835 parents of children living in the Sarlahi district of Nepal.  To test the stability of scores and identify competing models, the overall teacher and parent samples were randomly divided into subsamples, which were used for exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, respectively.  Exploratory factor analyses were used to identify competing factor solutions: several reduced, two-factor solutions for both scales.  Ten models (five CTRS-R models and five CPRS-R models) were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and the findings indicated that the reduced two-factor models of CTRS-R and CPRS-R scores were a better fit to the Nepalese data than the original models based on a US sample that was  identified by Conners.  Inattention and Hyperactivity factors were identified for CTRS-R scores, and Inattention and Oppositional factors were identified for CPRS-R scores.

A general procedure for the fabrication of nano-dimensional channels and their use as templates for the formation of nanomaterial arrays is presented in this thesis. The approach developed uses nanodimensional channels as permanent templates for the formation of nanomaterial arrays with precise dimensional, positional, and orientational control as well as with built-in electrical access, when appropriate. The procedure is general, allowing the synthesis of different materials inside the nanochannels, and opens the door to \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d manufacturing.\nTwo versions of nanochannels for the nanomaterial growth were fabricated, and different nanomaterials grown in the nanochannels were demonstrated. The first version of the template is a nanochannel without the built-in electrodes. The nanochannel template can be completely open and allows nanowire growth, alignment, precise positioning, and geometrical confinement. In the case of polymers this template approach allows different kinds of chain-growth polymerization, such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by radical polymerization, polythiophene (PT) by photopolymerization. It was also shown that polymer nanofilaments can even be released without breaking. The oxygen plasma etching and atomic force microscope tip cutting were used to verify the presence of polymer material. We also demonstrated the carbon nanofiber growth in this first version of the nanochannels using a catalyst metal in the middle in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. Carbon nanofibers can grow inside and even grow out of the nanochannels, and the dimension, location and orientation of carbon nanofibers followed the pre-designed nanochannels which establish that the nanochannel is also an effective growth template for carbon nanofibers.\n\tFully enclosed horizontal nanochannels, in a pre-arranged array with built-in electrical contacts and chemical access regions, were used as the second version of templates for electrochemical synthesis of conducting polymer nanoribbons. In this \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach, the nanochannel templates are part of the final array structure and remain after fabrication of the nanoribbons. The built-in electrical contacts, which provide the electrical potential for electrochemical polymerization, also remain and become contacts/interconnects to the array components. The \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d architecture and methodology removes the need for template dissolution, any post-synthesis nanoribbon \u201cgrow-and-then-place\u201d manipulation, and any post-synthesis electrical contacting. The fact that the templates are fully enclosed prohibits dendrite formation during growth, ensures precise dimensionality, and provides the encapsulation needed in any real device application. Polyaniline nanostructures electrochemically polymerized in the nanochannels were found to be fibrils that grow from the central region of the growth-template cross-section. Two-point and four-point electrical characterization of these polyaniline nanoribbons, obtained using the built-in electrodes, was employed to yield the true polyaniline conductivity and to assess the ohmicity of the contacting approach. Conductivity studies show conductivity increases as the width decreases. We also show that electrochemical polymerization is superior to the chemical polymerization using nanochannel growth template.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1174], "author_name_tesi": "Peng, Chih-Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Peng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chih-Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "S Ashok", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Jian Xu", "Sanjay B Joshi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanochannel", "nanowire", "nanoribbon", "template", "polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Quantization of affine coadjoint orbits", "id": "27431", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11847", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using twisted equivariant K-homology, E.

Tumor cells have been shown to exploit leukocyte function to enhance their metastatic properties under certain circumstances. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemotactic cytokine that regulates polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) mobilization and activity, and we hypothesize this cytokine influences tumor behavior. We have demonstrated that IL-8 is crucial for PMN-mediated melanoma extravasation under flow conditions. In addition, IL-8 is up-regulated in PMNs upon co-culturing with melanoma cells. Melanoma cells induce I\u0192\u00dbB-\u0192\u00d1 degradation in PMNs indicating that nuclear factor \u0192\u00dbB (NF-\u0192\u00dbB) signaling is active in PMNs. Furthermore, the production of IL-8 in PMNs is NF-\u0192\u00dbB dependent. We have further identified that IL-6 and IL-1\u0192\u00d2 from PMN-melanoma co-cultures synergistically contribute to I\u0192\u00dbB-\u0192\u00d1 degradation and IL-8 synthesis in PMNs. \nAttachment of tumor cells to the endothelium has been shown to be critical for tumor metastasis. We have shown a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated mechanism for the redistribution of interendothelial adherens junctions in response to melanoma cell contacts with the endothelium. We demonstrate that contact of melanoma cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells trigger rapid endothelial [Ca2+]i response through PLC-IP3 pathway. In addition, alternation of endothelial adherens junctions following contact of melanoma cells have been evidenced by the changes in immunological staining patterns of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin. A PLC inhibitor, U73122 is shown to significantly diminish [Ca2+]i response and reduce the occurrence of melanoma cell\u00a1Vinduced VE-cadherin reorganization. Moreover, inhibition of PLC attenuates melanoma cell transendothelial migration. However, melanoma cell-associated VE-cadherin breakdown is not sensitive to Ly294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol- 3-kinase (PI3K), whereas inhibition of PI3K resulted in a reduction of melanoma cell transmigration. \nTaken together, we have shown that melanoma cells induce PMNs to secrete IL-8 through activation of NF-\u0192\u00dbB and suggest a model in which this interaction promotes a microenvironment that is favorable for metastasis. Moreover, by inducing the PLC-Ca2+ signaling pathway, melanoma cells disrupt endothelial junctions to breach the endothelium and promote transvascular homing of tumor cells. In addition to experimental approaches, a mathematic model has been established for studying the intracellular dynamics, such as Ca2+ signaling. The tool is beneficial for signaling pathway analysis and discovery.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2344], "author_name_tesi": "Peng, Hsin-Hsin ", "last_name_ssi": "Peng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hsin-Hsin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheng Dong", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Peter J Butler", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheng Dong, Committee Chair", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cancer", "signaling", "adherens junction", "chemokine", "extravasation", "cytokine"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "MULTI-ECHELON SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK DESIGN FOR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IN AGILE MANUFACTURING", "id": "19083", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9128", "abstract_tesi": "Multi-echelon supply chain network design is widely discussed in the literature. Most studies in this area focus on mathematical model building and heuristic method to solve these models. Few of them have discussed a hybrid model method to solve this complex problem, especially with large customer demand with uncertainties. For innovative products, the biggest characteristics are the unpredictable customer demand and a focus on customer service level (CSL). In this thesis, a hybrid model is proposed combining a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and Monte Carlo simulation to solve a four-echelon supply chain network design problem for innovative products in a stochastic environment with three potential partners in each echelon. The objective is to get the maximum CSL at the lowest supply chain total cost. Compared to the deterministic model, the hybrid model results showed a 0.8% improvement in CSL when the demand variability is low and a 4.6% improvement when the demand variability is high. Then a trade off analysis between CSL and total supply chain cost is carried out to provide useful suggestions to decision makers. A 2^4 factorial experimental design is also conducted taking demand variability, capacity variability for selected partners, transportation capacity variability, and whether or not using the hybrid method as factors of interests. Among these factors, demand variability, whether or not using the hybrid model and their interaction proved to be significant. Finally, an efficiency test proved that the hybrid model can improve the CSL significantly compared with the MILP model.

Biological N fixation by free-living cyanobacteria has been utilized extensively in flooded rice paddy systems, but rarely in agriculture of temperate regions like the United States. The objective of this dissertation research was to develop a renewable means of delivering N to soils that will be environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial through reducing the need for commercial fertilizer and increasing soil stability. The approach involves the establishment of renewable biological soil crusts (BSCs) using filamentous N2-fixing cyanobacteria, which takes advantage of their capabilities to photosynthesize, fix atmospheric N2, and stabilize soil surfaces. The overarching hypothesis of this research is that cyanobacteria will survive and promote BSC succession after being applied to agricultural soils, as they increase soil carbon and N content.\nCyanobacteria were enriched from naturally formed BSCs on agricultural soils and their growth was compared to commercial strains in soil microcosm tests under N-limited conditions. Selected cyanobacteria were further evaluated for potential N2 fixation and soil N retention at different N concentrations, using 15N2 isotope labeling of cells and simulated rainfall experiments, respectively. A succession model was developed to simulate the microbial dynamics and N contributions of BSCs following the artificial application of N2-fixing cyanobacteria to soil. The model simulation results were compared with one year of observations of naturally occurring BSCs in agricultural fields. Additional cyanobacterial properties, including cyanotoxin content, drought resistance and large-scale biomass production in photobioreactors (PBRs) were also evaluated in consideration of future field applications. \nFirst, these results showed that artificial BSCs formed by DG1 - a cyanobacterial enrichment obtained from local agricultural soil - exhibit high biomass density and stability on N-limited soils (both sandy soil and silt loam soil). Second, DG1 could fix 0.1 mg N g-1 dry biomass day-1 from atmospheric N2 in N-free medium, but fixed less N2 in the presence of inorganic N. In addition, when soil nitrate was at adequate levels, application to soils of a small amount of living DG1 biomass (0.88 g dry biomass m-2) resulted in more soil nitrate retention under simulated rainfall than non-inoculated controls. Thus DG1 has potential to reduce N loss from soil. Third, based on the dynamics of cyanobacteria, green algae, and moss compartments of BSCs in model simulations and field observations, application of cyanobacteria (i.e. DG1) could accelerate the growth and succession of BSCs, and improve N retention in soil, especially when the inoculum is added to soils with high available inorganic N. Finally, DG1 has several additional properties that are favorable for field application, including negative cyanotoxin test results, rapid recovery after eight weeks under air-dry conditions, preliminary evidence of UV protection, and capability for growth in large-scale PBRs. \nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of developing high-performance cyanobacterial enrichments for future applications in temperate agriculture. The results showed that the selected cyanobacterial enrichment DG1 has potential to be used as an agricultural soil amendment to accelerate BSC formation, improve soil stability and reduce application rates of synthetic N fertilizer.

Using the number of articles covering a client firm (a proxy for visibility) I find multiple forms of evidence that auditors do respond to the visibility of their clients.

These increased fees are consistent with predicted increases in auditor effort and perceived auditor business risk. The audit fee evidence is corroborated using other proxies for auditor decisions: audit report modifications, the level of accruals, and auditor turnover. The evidence suggests that auditors respond to risks driven by press coverage. Additionally, I find evidence of costs of media coverage to auditors. First, I find that the propensity for a client firm to receive an AAER from the SEC is increasing in the prior year\u2019s visibility. Second, I find that the total revenue an auditor receives from its entire client portfolio is decreasing with the absolute dollar value of restatements by high visibility client firms. These findings indicate that auditors must consider both reputation and monetary concerns in audits of clients subject to high media visibility. I conclude that the press not only participates in the external monitoring of financial reporting, but that through its influence on official external monitors the press actually also affects financial reporting.

This study focused on one of three school districts to receive $4.2 million in funding over two years. It is intended that each school district will serve as resource and demonstration center for the state, providing examples of how technology can change public school education, achieve cost savings, and deliver education in ways currently not imagined.\n\nSuch meaningful educational change that leads to improved teaching and learning is demanding and difficult, even for the best teachers.  Overall the story of educational reform in the United States is a story of nervous movement from one fad to another, with little ensuring affect on teaching practice (Tyack & Cuban, 1995). Hargreaves (2001) agrees that the overwhelming majority of literature on educational reform is a catalog of teacher failures and shortcomings as they repeatedly fall short of the ever rising and changing expectations. Nolan and Meister (2000) state that a major reason for this lack of success is the neglect of the phenomenology of change. The failure to understand how individuals experience change in contrast to how it was intended is at the heart of the spectacular failure of reform efforts (Fullan, 2001). \n\nLiterally hundreds of books focusing on the topic of educational change have been published within the past few years, but most neglect the human side of change (Nolan & Meister, 2000). Fullan (2001) writes, too few studies of educational change are written from the perspective of teachers who are simultaneously the subjects and objects of change. \n\nThe purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of seven public-school teachers engaged in a school restructuring effort intended to transform a Pennsylvania School District into a Digital School District. This research provides a basis for analyzing how teachers experience and understand change. The research questions driving this study were: What are the teachers experiencing as they engage in district wide reform? How do these teachers understand and make sense of their lived experience of being a teacher during this change process? In what ways does a financial windfall to a school district inform the experiences it has in relation to school reform? \n\nThis study employed qualitative methodology in which I spent prolonged amounts of time engaged with these teachers. The goal was to capture and portray as vividly as possible the teachers\u2019 experiences during the restructuring initiative and their attempts to make sense of their experience. A phenomenological case study research design framed and guided the study. Phenomenological inquiry allowed me to uncover the common structure underlying the teachers\u2019 experience of district wide-reform. The data consisted of in-depth interviews, participant observation, document analysis, and descriptive field notes. Through a prolonged and iterative process of data analysis using the constant comparison method provided by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and the operational refinements cited in Lincoln and Guba (1985) I documented the lived experience of being an educator during this change process from the teachers\u2019 perspective. As a tool for describing, analyzing, and interpreting the data, I utilized NVIVO, a computer software program for the purposes of organizing, coding, analyzing and interpreting qualitative data (Richards & Richards, 1994). The techniques of prolonged engagement, persistent observation, triangulation, member checks, thick description, reflexive journals, and audit trail were employed to establish trustworthiness.\n\nFive overlapping themes emerged from this study as these seven teachers experienced change intended to transform the school district where they teach into a Digital School District: uncertainty and frustration, learning to change, barriers to change, craft pride, and potential. Within this research the themes are presented individually although a compartmentalized approach that may prove to be inadequate. As Sikes (1992) states, \u201ca holistic approach is essential to what is, after all, a holistic situation\u201d(p.39). But following the lead of Sikes, somewhat contradictorily, the themes are identified separately. Interpretation of the teacher\u2019s voices reveal assertions that attempt to make sense of their collective experience. Implications of these assertions are discussed in addition to further questions and opportunities for further research. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1191], "author_name_tesi": "Penny, Christian Vincent", "last_name_ssi": "Penny", "middle_name_ssi": "Vincent", "first_name_ssi": "Christian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Iris M Striedieck", "John Daniel Marshall", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Debra M Feedman", "Kyle Leonard Peck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Iris M Striedieck, Committee Chair", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Debra M Feedman, Committee Member", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["digital", "lived experience", "teachers", "phenomenology"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Exploring RNA Flexibility Using Molecular Dynamics", "id": "14168kap335", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14168", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as powerful regulators of gene expression. Approximately 22 nucleotides in length, these RNAs are found in most eukaryotes, including humans. Through a process called RNA interference (RNAi), mature miRNA binds target mRNA molecules to accomplish gene silencing. Recently, miRNA has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for various disease states that have been linked to changes in miRNA expression.\n\nIn humans, miRNA is produced in the form of a stem-loop pri-miRNA structure containing approximately 100 nucleotides. Through a series of binding and cleavage events collectively referred to as the miRNA maturation pathway, this primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) is converted to the single-stranded mature miRNA that participates in RNAi. The underlying molecular processes of the miRNA maturation pathway are not completely understood. Structural characterization of the proteins and nucleic acids along this pathway will contribute to a deeper understanding of miRNA that would be particularly beneficial in the pharmaceutical industry. \n\nFive proteins along the miRNA maturation pathway possess at least one double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) responsible for facilitating protein-RNA interactions. These evolutionarily-conserved domains form non-bonded interactions with the phosphodiester backbone and 2\u2032-hydroxyl groups within the minor groove of dsRNA. Although the precise mechanism remains unclear, dsRBDs generally recognize their substrates in a shape-dependent and non sequence-specific manner.\n\nThe TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) is responsible for binding precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) and presenting it to Dicer for cleavage. In a previous study, binding by TRBP was demonstrated to exclude sites of helical imperfections. The ubiquity of such imperfections in miRNA suggests that dsRBDs can sense these structural features in order ensure the proper orientation of their substrates for cleavage. \nThe overarching aim of this work was to characterize the binding events along the miRNA maturation pathway with respect to RNA flexibility. Initially, we use circular dichroism (CD), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate a simplified system containing TRBP-dsRBD2 and a perfect WC duplex of 20 GC base pairs. Strong protein-RNA contacts were observed in expected regions of the complex, supporting the previous notion that TRBP preferentially binds to perfect WC duplexes. Although cocrystal structures suggest that binding by TRBP and Xlrbpa-2 induces strong bends in coaxially-stacked GC10-mers, no large-scale conformational changes were detected in the TRBP / GC20 complex. We conclude that the bending observed in the cocrystal structures is most likely a result of the artificial double-stranded break between the oligomers. \n\nHaving established a suitable method for performing and analyzing MD simulations of a simple dsRBD / dsRNA complex, we designed a more realistic system. We selected pri-mir-16-1 for this study based on the SHAPE-constrained MC-Pipeline structures previously determined by our laboratory. The three-dimensional structure model of pri-mir-16-1 reveals two deformable \u201chot spots.\u201d The deformable region adjacent to the Drosha cut site was observed in other pri-miRNAs and was demonstrated to influence processing efficiency. A second region was identified for pri-mir-16-1 in the vicinity of its A37 / A76 mismatch and nearby U79 bulge. It has been suggested that structural distortions of this type promote DGCR8 binding by allowing the formation of strong axial bends. Toward complete characterization of this binding event, unbound pri-mir-16-1 was simulated using the same protocol as above. Preliminary results indicate that the procedures for trajectory analysis require modification to accommodate structural imperfections. Further investigation of this system will illuminate the effect of structural imperfections on the conformational flexibility of dsRNA and provide a reliable means of investigating similar interactions along the miRNA maturation pathway.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14699], "author_name_tesi": "Penrod, Katheryn Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Penrod", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Katheryn", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Scott A.

Visible pump\u2013infrared probe spectroscopy is used to generate excitons within organic photovoltaic blend films and the photochemical sequence of events that follows is monitored with an infrared probe pulse tuned to a vibrational mode specific to the electron acceptor. A gradient of vibrational frequencies exists in blend films such that the motion of electrons away from sites where electron transfer occurs can be measured. This gradient of vibrational frequencies arises from a gradient of solvent environments present in the blend film. Using two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy and other IR third-order techniques, we characterize the dynamics of the vibrational mode in the ground-state electronic potential and demonstrate that these dynamics do not interfere with the interpretation of the frequency shift observed in the visible pump\u2013infrared probe experiment in terms of electron motion.\n\nWe have used this technique to measure the barrier to charge separation at low excitation densities in thin blend films consisting of device-relevant organic photovoltaic materials. For example, we have measured the barrier to charge separation in organic photovoltaic blend films consisting of the \u03c0-conjugated polymer RR-P3HT as electron donor blended with either the functionalized fullerene PCBM or soluble perylene diimide derivative BTBP as electron acceptor. We observe barrierless charge separation in the blend with PCBM while we find charge separation is activated in the blend with BTBP. In combination with X-ray scattering measurements performed by our collaborators, we argue that fullerenes are capable of barrierless charge separation in the presence of structural disorder while perylenes may require structural order to effect barrierless charge separation. Lastly, we find that separated charge carriers can be generated without a donor/acceptor heterojunction in films consisting exclusively of PCBM via the dissociation of charge transfer excitons.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7045], "author_name_tesi": "Pensack, Ryan ", "last_name_ssi": "Pensack", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John B Asbury", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Mark Maroncelli", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John B Asbury, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy", "charge transfer state", "organic photovoltaics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Utilization of ICR Kinematics in Estimation, Control, and Energy-Aware Mission Planning for Skid-Steer Vehicles", "id": "23458", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation provides details of work completed in the areas of skid-steer robot modeling, trajectory control, power modeling, and energy use prediction.

Experiments utilizing the photoelectron imaging technique are performed on the negative ions of the group 10 noble metal block (i.e. Ni&#8722;, Pd&#8722;, and Pt&#8722;) of the periodic table.  The accessible transitions, term energies and orbital angular momentum components of the bound electronic states in the atom are then compared with photoelectron images collected for isoelectronic early transition metal heterogeneous diatomic molecules, M-X (M = Ti, Zr, W; X = O or C).  A superposition principle connecting the spectroscopy between the atomic and molecular species is found to exist wherein the electronic structure of the diatomic is observed to mimic that present in the isoelectronic atom.  The molecular ions studied in this work, TiO&#8722;, ZrO&#8722;, and WC&#8722; can then be interpreted as superatomic manifestations of the respective isoelectronic elements appearing on the periodic table.  The superposition principle, in the context of the unified atom picture from molecular orbital theory, allows for the assignment of molecular electronic transitions to be referenced to the atomic frame.  This approach represents a novel method of determining the electronic state origins of transitions appearing in the photoelectron spectra of molecular anions by directly comparing the known spectroscopy for the isoelectronic element.    \nDuring course of these investigations, a technique is devised, termed here the &#946;-wave approach, to interpret the photoelectron angular distributions (PAD) produced from partial wave emission of molecular orbitals constructed of varying combinations of atomic orbital angular momentum.  At the single photon energy employed, the geometrical information describing the continuum state partial wave symmetries is observed to be in good agreement with the anisotropy ascertained directly from the measured PAD.  The spectroscopic implications arising from the &#946;-wave approach are that the exact molecular orbital associated with an assigned electronic transition can be determined, thus providing unambiguous electronic state term designation.  \nFollowing an overview in chapter 2 of the employed experimental methods and data analysis routines, chapters 3 \u2013 5 presents the results of the photoelectron imaging experiments of the isoelectronic systems, TiO&#8722;/Ni&#8722;, ZrO&#8722;/Pd&#8722;, and WC&#8722;/Pt&#8722; all obtained at a photon energy of 2.33 eV (532 nm).  In chapter 3, a remarkable correspondence is observed between the separate PADs produced independently by TiO&#8722; and Ni&#8722;, suggesting the bound ionic state of the diatomic is mimicking that present in the negative atomic ion.  Application of the &#946;-wave approach provides supporting evidence that the dominant photodetachment channel in TiO&#8722; arises from electron emission of the highest ocuupied 9&#963; molecular orbital.  This provides an immediate assignment of the ground electronic state of TiO&#8722; as the doublet 2&#916;3/2 configuration.  Similarly, the ground electronic state of Ni&#8722; is 2D5/2 with 4s orbital ejection describing the ground state electron affinity transition.    \nObtained in chapter 4 is an improved measurement of the electron affinity of ZrO&#8722;, determined to be 1.29(1) eV.  This energy arises from the assigned anion to neutral ground state, 1&#931;+ &#8592; 2&#931;&#8722;, electronic transition.  Further indentified are features assigned to the 2&#916;3/2 and 2&#916;5/2 electronically excited states of the anion, with the 2&#916;3/2 spin orbit component is measured to lie ~ 0.10 eV above the 2&#931;&#8722; ground state.  A fine structure splitting of the 2&#916;5/2-2&#916;3/2 is subsequently ascertained to be ~ 0.42 eV (3428.5 cm-1).  The electronic level structure and relative energy spacing of ZrO&#8722; is shown to be virtually identical to the isoelectronic atom, Pd&#8722;.  \nThe first measurement of the photoelectron binding energy spectrum of Pt&#8722;, at a fixed frequency photon energy of 2.33 eV is presented in chapter 5.  Intense signatures in the PAD were observed from the electron affinity transition, 3D3 &#8592; 2D5/2.  Other observed electronic transitions accessed the closely coupled first and second excited states, 1D2 and 3F4, of neutral Pt.  Several weak intensity features were assigned to excitations stemming from the electronically excited states, 2D3/2 and 2S1/2, of metastable Pt&#8722; ions.  Anisotropy &#946; parameters were measured from the PAD of Pt&#8722; and for partial wave emission proceeding from the 6s atomic orbital were found to deviate substantially from expected behavior based on the dipole selection rule. \nChapter 5 also presents the photoelectron image of the isoelectronic diatomic molecule, WC&#8722;, acquired at a photon energy of 2.33 eV (532 nm).  Several electronic transitions originating from the 2&#916;3/2 electronic ground state were observed, and the evaluated electron affinity, defined by the transition 3&#916;1 &#8592; 2&#916;3/2, was found to be in good agreement with a previous measurement.  However, new assignments were made for transitions stemming from the fine structure 2&#916;5/2 component and higher energy 4&#931;&#8722; metastable electronic state of the anion.  These spectroscopic designations were found to mirror those in the isoelectronic element, Pt&#8722; both in energetic term level ordering and total angular momentum symmetry of the occupied molecular orbitals.  The reassignments were further supported from an applied &#946;-wave analysis, which was found to reproduce the experimental PAD accurately.  Connections were made regarding the similar catalytic activity observed between the isoelectronic systems, Pt and WC.  The bonding overlap region of the highest occupied 16&#963; molecular orbital of WC is argued to replicate the relativistic radial collapse of the 6s atomic orbital of Pt, an effect commonly attributed to the heavy Z elements.   \nDiscussed in chapter 6 are the photoelectron imaging experiments conducted on small silicon cluster anions, Sin&#8722; (n = 2 \u2013 7), acquired at a photon energy of 3.49 eV (355 nm).  Electronic transitions arising from the anion ground states are assigned, and the evaluated vertical detachment energies are observed to agree well with previous measurements.  The anisotropy &#946; parameters have also been determined for each unique feature appearing in the PADs at the photon energy employed.  Theoretical calculations performed at the (U)B3LYP//6-311++G(3df, 3pd) level are undertaken to determine the relative atomic orbital contributions constructing the interrogated highest occupied and low-lying molecular orbitals of a specific cluster.  Highlighted in the &#946;-wave analysis is the possibility of discriminating between disparate molecular orbitals of opposing point group symmetry from two nearly isoenergetic structural isomers of the Si4&#8722; and Si6&#8722; cluster ions.  \nPresented in chapter 7 are the results of a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometric study on large silicon hydride cluster anions, SinHx&#8722; (where n = 8 \u2013 12,  .  The clusters were produced via the laser-induced plasma reactions between a dilute silane mixture and a transition metal plasma.  Extensive degrees of hydrogenation were observed for larger Sin&#8722; clusters, with an onset appearing around Si8&#8722; and continuing on into the Si12&#8722; series.  The relative abundances of the majority isotopes constituting a precise mass were completely analyzed allowing quantitative assessments of the relative stability for a particular SinHx&#8722; cluster to be ascertained.  The SinHx&#8722; clusters are observed to possess varying stabilities depending on the extent of hydrogenation and the number of silicon atoms constituting the cluster.  Specific clusters, which exhibited enhanced stability in the molecular beam, are Si8H6&#8722;, Si8H8&#8722;, Si9H5&#8722;, Si11H2&#8722; and Si12H2&#8722;, respectively.  In general, the lighter Si8-10Hx&#8722; clusters were dominated by high relative abundances of the pure silicon cluster parent, Si8-10&#8722;, and the singly hydrogenated cluster, Si8-10H&#8722;.  A pronounce decrease in relative stability was then noted with one additional H adsorption, forming the di-hydride Si8-10H2&#8722; species.  The exact converse was observed in the heavier silicon hydride series, Si11-12Hx&#8722;, where the pure silicon cluster parent, Si11-12&#8722;, and single hydride, Si11-12H&#8722; are suppressed by a substantial production of an especially stable Si11-12H2&#8722; di-hydride moiety.  These trends, and several others, are interpreted with the aid of available theoretical density functional calculations, suggesting geometrical distortions create energetic stabilizations by removing the degeneracy associated with partially filled electronic states.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5618], "author_name_tesi": "Peppernick, Samuel John", "last_name_ssi": "Peppernick", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "James Hansell Adair", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alchemy", "Photoelectron Imaging", "Superatoms", "Isoelectronic", "Superposition Principle"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "COLLECTIVE EFFICACY AND FEAR OF CRIME IN THE CONTEXT OF NATURAL GAS DEVELOPMENT", "id": "13775jcp283", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13775", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In previous studies natural resource development has been linked to social disruption and increased fear of crime (Freudenburg & Jones, 1991; Covey & Menard, 1983). Outside of the realm of natural resource development, social researchers have identified perceptions of collective efficacy as a social combatant to fear of crime and violence. Sampson et al. (1997: 919) defined collective efficacy as \u201csocial cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene on behalf of the common good.\u201d This work seeks to investigate the amounts and interactions of both collective efficacy and fear of crime within the context of natural gas development in Pennsylvania. There is an overarching belief held by many local rural Pennsylvanians that the out of state workers that have come to Pennsylvania are ne\u2019er-do-wells or even potential criminals (Filteau, 2012). Due to the relatively short length of time the natural gas industry has been in Pennsylvania, little social research has been done in this area, with even less investigation into fear of crime. This work measures survey respondents\u2019 perceived collective efficacy, its effects on fear of crime, and any mediating effects that natural gas well density (thus possible interactions with workers) may have on that interaction. The study finds that increased collective efficacy is associated with decreased feelings of fear of crime; it does not find any influence on this correlation by the number of gas wells around respondents. This study contributes to the collective efficacy literature as well as natural resource development literature by bringing the two together within the context of natural gas in Pennsylvania. Specifically, this work improves the discussion of social disruption by hypothesizing a more concrete measurement of social cohesion.

This work focuses on the poorly studied role that blood-vessel branching and growth (angiogenesis) plays during craniofacial bone formation and mineralization (osteogenesis).  We hypothesized that angiogenesis dysregulation can produce evolutionary relevant variation of the craniofacial complex.  Measurements of bone volume and relative density, derived from high resolution computed tomography images of an Fgfr2+/P253R mouse model of Apert syndrome, defined the \u201cnormal\u201d pattern of craniofacial bone growth and maturation across the late embryonic period and suggested several hypotheses about the cellular basis of skeletal dysmorphology associated with the Fgfr2 P253R mutation.  3D images of blood vessels and other soft tissue layers  associated with the initial intramembranous mineralization of the frontal bone of these mice were generated with a hybrid optical coherence tomography and photoacoustic microscopy system in order to investigate the relationship between invading blood vessels and mineralizing bone.  Although the resulting images did not resolve microvasculature or mineralizing frontal bone as we had expected, the results of this work provide the foundation for future studies and suggest that the Fgfr2 P253R mutation may reduce the length of large superficial embryonic blood vessels of the head.  Finally, the craniofacial skeletal phenotypes of mice that conditionally express this mutation in endothelial cells were quantified in order to determine if endothelial expression is associated with the craniofacial dysmorphology noted in the Fgfr2+/P253R mice.  A combination of landmark based and volume/relative density based analyses suggested that endothelial expression of the mutation is associated with overall reduced scale of the skull.  We hypothesized that this reduction is based on reduced endothelial sprouting during the angiogenesis associated with initial mineralization of craniofacial bones.  In total, this work introduces refined methods to quantify important phenotypic aspects of the craniofacial complex and provides evidence that dysregulation of angiogenesis can serve as the indirect basis of craniofacial skeletal dysmorphology.  This, in turn, suggests the importance of angiogenesis regulation in producing evolutionarily relevant skeletal variation found in our evolutionary past.

Since 2010, Sri Lankan universities have been the site of turbulent events, including a state-initiated military-led undergraduate orientation programme; appointments of allegedly unsuitable individuals to higher administrative positions in universities; infringements of student rights and unions. In parallel, a dynamic trade union campaign has generated discussions on the role of state universities and the functions of higher education. I study the discourses of academics on militarisation in this environment, in its public and individual aspects. The research questions are: a) What are the discourses of militarisation in Sri Lankan academia, as formulated publicly and individually? b) What changes are evident in individual discourses of militarisation amongst Sri Lankan academia over a long duration of time? The study uses a methodological framework that includes an ethnographic approach and discourse analysis. It uses interviews as instances of individual voice, and texts produced by FUTA, the academic trade union, as the public (and collective) voice of academics. These texts include policy documents and press releases by FUTA as well as posters and pamphlets. Conversation analytic methods are adapted for transcription of the interviews, and discursive strategies of stance, narrative and voice for analysis. Even though literature on militarisation of higher education continues to grow, few locally specific studies exist outside North America and Europe. In addition, research from a person-oriented or discourse analytic approach is rare, as is research focusing on academic institutions.

PCC 7002 has been extensively developed as a platform for biotechnological applications, with much emphasis in biofuel-related research. A significant limitation to this strain is its obligate requirement for exogenous vitamin B12 (cobalamin). This study demonstrated that the limitation in methionine biosynthesis occurs because cobalamin is a coenzyme for conversion of L-homocysteine to L-methionine via the methionine synthase enzyme MetH. Complementation of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 with a cobalamin-independent methionine synthase isozyme, MetE, from Synechococcus sp. PCC 73109 was eliminated the cobalamin auxotrophy. This new strain will enable large-scale growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 without the addition of cobalamin, which will reduce the cost of cultivation. Additionally, the MetE enzyme can be employed as a selective marker by auxotrophic complementation that is useful as a non-antibiotic selection marker.\n\nThe leader sequence of MetE contains a putative cobalamin riboswitch that was utilized to develop a cobalamin-repressible system as an addition to the expanding genetic toolbox of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Since this organism does not produce the essential cobalamin coenzyme de novo, it must be taken up from an exogenous source. An active transport ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter system for cobalamin uptake was identified in silico and verified in vivo by knock-out mutagenesis. The MetE riboswitch fused to the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) protein served as a fluorescence reporter to assess intracellular uptake of cobalamin in the ABC transporter deletion mutants. This work corrected a previous misannotation of the genome, in which the genes for cobalamin uptake were previously assigned to uptake of an iron siderophore.. In addition, it was discovered that this operon is under the control of the sole cobalamin riboswitch in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002\n\nTo expand the genetic toolbox for industrial application of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, a Zn++-inducible expression system was developed utilizing the methallothionein (smtA) promoter of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and co-expressing its native repressor StmB. When combined with a zurA mutant background in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, this system provides a tightly regulated induction system that utilizes \uf06dM concentrations of Zn++ as a low-cost inducer in comparison to more traditional agents such as isopropyl \uf062-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) utilized in the lac operon. These tools and strains were designed to assist in the genetic manipulation of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and further increase its value as a versatile cyanobacterial model.\n\nThis study also focused on in vivo implementation of photosystem I (PS I) as a light-driven module for activating exogenous redox-active catalysts (e.g., hydrogenase for H2 production). A strain capable of producing PS I complexes with a variant stromal PsaC subunit poised to tether thiolated compounds was constructed. The strain harboring the variant PS I complexes was still capable of photoautotrophic growth, despite the observation that a novel iron-sulfur cluster resides in the FB site of PsaC, and acts as the terminal electron acceptor in the PS I electron transfer chain.

However, mixed results regarding the effective use of cognitive reappraisal within certain cultural contexts and in response to racial discrimination have begun to call into question the inherent utility of using this strategy.  Specifically, several studies have now shown cognitive reappraisal to be ineffective at down-regulating negative affect in response to racial discrimination or to be associated with worse psychological functioning within contexts characterized by multiple levels of oppression.  Studies have yet to determine if cognitive reappraisal is inherently maladaptive in the face of discrimination and what specific characteristics of cognitive reappraisal (e.g., perspective) or aspects of the stressor (e.g., level of personal salience) alter its effectiveness.  Research has shown that successful self-reflection requires one take a self-distanced perspective in order to understand why an event occurred; yet it remains to be seen if such an approach retains the positive effects of reappraisal in the face of discrimination.  Similarly, it stands to reason that certain individuals may find racial discrimination to be more or less personally salient and, therefore, more or less difficult to reappraise.  The present study examined the effectiveness of positive reappraisal, self-distancing reappraisal, and rumination in down-regulating self-reported negative affect (anxiety and anger) and physiological arousal (using preejection period and respiratory sinus arrhythmia as indicators of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively) in response to racism.

Reduced bulk permeability due to grain size reduction, porosity loss, and cementation in shear bands can lead to decreased reservoir quality and compartmentalization. Previous studies have mainly focused on characterization of band geometry, grain size, structure, and origin. Permeability measurements for shear bands are rare, and have generally been limited to shear bands created in a laboratory or to field measurements under atmospheric pressure conditions. The purpose of this study is to quantify permeability reduction in shear bands, and investigate links between permeability and other physical properties. I present a comprehensive suite of data obtained for naturally occurring shear bands from an outcrop of unlithified sand in the footwall of the McKinleyville thrust fault in northern California. These data include laboratory permeability, porosity, and grain size measurements, as well as SEM and XRD analyses. I measured shear band and host sand permeability under isostatic stress conditions, for confining pressures ranging from 0.05 - 5 MPa. At each confining pressure, I applied a constant flow rate across the sample, measured the resulting pressure gradient using a differential pressure transducer, and determined permeability by Darcy\u2019s Law. \n\nI find that the mean grain size for host sand is 208 \u00b5m, whereas the mean grain size for shear bands ranges from 31 \u2013 185 \u00b5m, with the mean grain size decreasing as a function of increasing band thickness. Host sand porosity ranges from 42 - 45%, and shear band porosity ranges from 32 - 39%. SEM images indicate that shear bands have higher abundance of phyllosilicates but the there is no evidence of phyllosilicates clogging pore space or coating grains in the host sand. Host sand permeability decreases from ~1x10-14 m2 (10 mD) to ~2x10-15 m2 (2 mD) as effective stress is increased from 0.4 to 5 MPa. Results for five shear bands illustrate a decrease from ~8x10-15 m2 to ~1x10-17 m2 over a similar stress range (0.05 to 5 MPa). Results suggest a clear, systematic relationship between larger shear band thickness and decreased grain size, decreased porosity, increased phyllosilicate content, and decreased permeability.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1870], "author_name_tesi": "Perez, Enrique ", "last_name_ssi": "Perez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Enrique", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cataclasis", "Permeability", "Shear bands", "Deformation bands"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION ON THE CONTROLLED AUTOIGNITION OF HYDROCARBON FUELS\n\n", "id": "11447", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4923", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents the results from the studies on the e&#64256;ects of the chemical structure and the relative concentration of the components on the autoignition behavior of hydrocarbon mixtures.

Strong e&#64256;ects of the fuel chemistry were also evident in the HCCI experiments in the Ricardo Hydra engine, where the performance was measured in terms of thermal e&#64259;ciency (&#951;f), combustion phasing as crank angle for 50 % heat release (CA50), burning rate as maximum pressure rise rate (MPRR), indicated mean e&#64256;ective pressure (IMEP) and its coe&#64259;cient of variation (COV) and brake-speci&#64257;c unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. The blends rich in isooctane (60 % isooctane, 10 % n-heptane, 10 % methylcyclohexane, 10 % toluene, 10 % 1-hexene) and rich in methylcyclohexane (60 % methylcyclohexane, 10 % n-heptane, 10 % isooctane, 10 % toluene, 10 % 1-hexene) showed the best performance as measured by the performance parameters. The sensitivity analysis showed that fuel e&#64256;ects are as important as the changes in operational conditions (engine speed, intake air temperature) on thermal e&#64259;ciency, combustion phasing and burning rate, but IMEP was mostly a&#64256;ected by the operational parameters. The results showed the best performance for the blends with 60 % volume of methylcyclohexane or 60 % of 1-hexene, for which the thermal e&#64259;ciency,\ncombustion phasing and burning rates changed the least as engine speed (900 - 1200 RPM) and intake air temperature (90 \u2013 180 ) were changed. \nThe main oxidation routes identi&#64257;ed for n-heptane and isooctane involved the formation of the corresponding alkylperoxy radicals and 1,6 H-atom isomerization to produce cyclic ethers as main products. However, the main products from the\nlow-temperature reactions of methylcyclohexane were the conjugate ole&#64257;ns, while the main products from 1-hexene (pentanal, butyraldehyde) resulted from the addition of OH and HO2 radicals to the double bond. Toluene did not react at all\nin the low-temperature regime, either as a pure component or in blends, which is against the hypotheses of co-oxidation of toluene during the cool-&#64258;ame reactions of more reactive components. The distribution of stable intermediates also supports the hypothesis of independence of mechanisms during the low-temperature oxida-\ntion of hydrocarbon mixtures. For example, there are no signi&#64257;cant di&#64256;erences in the relative distribution of products from the binary mixtures of isooctane with n-heptane, methylcyclohexane, toluene or 1-hexene.\nThe &#64257;ndings from this dissertation also have implications for the operations of petroleum re&#64257;neries if they embrace the large-scale production of hydrocarbon fuels for HCCI engines. The requirement for high content of methylcyclohexane (naphthenes) that was found to be bene&#64257;cial for HCCI combustion is probably the most signi&#64257;cant change with respect to current gasolines, where only a limited amount of these components are expected since naphthenes and low-octane para&#64259;ns are converted to high-octane aromatics and isopara&#64259;ns through catalytic reforming. However, the processing of unconventional oil sources (e.g., oil sands) may lead to an increased production of a naphthene-rich stream, among others, that might &#64257;nd a suitable use in the production of HCCI fuels and other specialty chemicals. At the end, the quality of the crude oils, the complexity of the re&#64257;nery and the actual demand for HCCI fuels will de&#64257;ne the best way to accomplish the changes in operations.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4900], "author_name_tesi": "Perez, Peter Larry", "last_name_ssi": "Perez", "middle_name_ssi": "Larry", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Chunshan Song", "Yaw D Yeboah", "Thomas Litzinger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Yaw D Yeboah, Committee Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Design of Experiments", "HCCI", "Fuel Chemistry", "Autoignition", "Statistical Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ALKYNYLIODONIUM SALTS IN ORGANIC SYNTHESIS.

In one example, reaction of an alkynyliodonium salt with soft nucleophiles via conjugate addition, followed by loss of iodobenzene, generates alkylidenecarbenes.   Alkylidenecarbenes are divalent, short lived intermediates capable of participating in a various bond-forming processes depending upon the functionality present within the molecule.   Due to the wide variety of possible reactions, alkylidenecarbenes are useful reactive intermediates in natural product synthesis.  \nThe application of alkynyliodonium salts to generate alkylidenecarbenes is described in the first part of this thesis.  Chapter 1 discusses the formation of alkynyliodonium salts and their application towards the generation of alkylidenecarbenes.  The total synthesis of radermachol, a natural product target, was examined utilizing an alkylidenecarbene addition to a double bond as a key step.  However, preliminary results shifted the focus away from this synthesis.  Instead, aryl C-H insertion was examined by the reaction of phenoxide anions of naphthol derivatives with an alkynyliodonium salt.  A variety of naphthol derivatives were used to study the preference for C-H insertion in these aromatic systems. \n\nHalichlorine is a natural product target to which alkynyliodonium chemistry was applied in chapter 2.   Halichlorine is a structurally unique marine alkaloid, which has interesting biological activity, in that it is a selective inhibitor of VCAM-1.  The focus of the synthesis of halichlorine centers on the formation of a key quaternary center of the spirocyclic ring system.  This bond can be formed using an alkynyliodonium salt to generate an alkylidenecarbene, which can undergo a 1,5-C-H insertion to generate the quaternary center with retention of stereochemistry.  This synthesis highlights the use of alkynyliodonium salt chemistry for increasing molecular complexity in a single operation.  \n\nThe final project discussed in this thesis is the progress made towards the total synthesis of kinamycin F.  Kinamycin F is a compound in a class of potent antibiotics, whose members have also exhibited interesting cytotoxicity to a variety of tumor cell lines via cleavage of double stranded DNA.  The proposed mechanism of action of these kinamycin compounds is thought to be through a bio-reductive process, generating a radical species which interacts with DNA leading to strand scission.  Completion of the total synthesis of kinamycin F will permit a more thorough evaluation of the hypothesized biological mechanism of action.     \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [232], "author_name_tesi": "Perkins, Angela L", "last_name_ssi": "Perkins", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Angela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ken S Feldman", "Blake R Peterson", "RAYMOND LEE FUNK", "Squire J Booker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ken S Feldman, Committee Chair", "Blake R Peterson, Committee Member", "RAYMOND LEE FUNK, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["halichlorine", "alkynyliodonium salts", "alkylidenecarbene", "kinamycin", "nazarov cyclization"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Experimental and Computational Study of Choline Chloride-based Deep Eutectic Solvents", "id": "18824", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Deep eutectic solvents (DES), considered readily available and relatively inexpensive ionic liquid (IL) analogues, show potential for many material science applications over conventional ILs.  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed on four different DES to provide atomistic insight into the hydrogen bonding interactions of these systems.  The simulations showed excellent agreement with the available experimental values for the density, volume expansion coefficients, and heat capacities showing proper validation for the modified force field used.  Atom-atom and center of mass (COM) radial distribution functions (RDF) are discussed showing contact distances for possible hydrogen bonding interactions.  A thorough hydrogen bond analysis was performed on each system to determine the relative \u201cmobility\u201d of the moieties in the system and relative fraction of hydrogen bonding types in the system.  The four systems showed either dominant anion-HBD and HBD-HBD interactions or anion-HBD and cation-anion interactions.  Experimental infrared (IR) spectra are also reported for choline chloride-urea and choline chloride-malonic acid mixtures with a discussion on band assignments.  The spectra of the mixtures are compared to the spectra of the pure constituents in order to see changes in the hydrogen bonding interactions.  For the OH stretching region of the IR spectra of both systems (between 3500 cm-1 and 3000 cm-1), possible hydrogen bond interactions are compared to molecular simulation results in order to determine the most probable interactions.  IR bands in the carbonyl stretching (and NH2 bending for the case of choline chloride-urea) region are curve-resolved and compared to interactions observed in the molecular simulations.  For choline chloride-urea systems, it is suggested that there is a strong interaction between the NH2 of urea and the chlorine anion where the system wants to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds to the anion.  Additionally, the disappearance of \u201cfree\u201d carbonyl groups upon increasing concentrations of urea suggests that as this concentration increases, the anion-urea complex remains but with additional interactions that remove the \u201cfree\u201d carbonyl band from the spectra.  For choline chloride-malonic acid interactions, two main peaks assigned in the carbonyl stretching region in the pure malonic acid spectrum as a transition dipole coupling, now become two peaks at slightly different frequencies.  In the spectra of the mixture, the higher frequency band in this region is assigned to the \u201cfree\u201d carbonyl stretching mode where the OH of this carboxylic group interacts with a different moiety. The second band at a lower frequency is a hydrogen bonded carbonyl group. These two types of carbonyl interactions are consistent with interactions observed in the molecular simulations.  Now that these systems have been simulated and analyzed through a detailed molecular simulations and vibrational study, the conclusions and knowledge of the interactions can be implemented towards finding new DES from the vast number of possible combinations and/or towards the design of DESs for different applications, e.g., the phase separation of oil and sand.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8881], "author_name_tesi": "Perkins, Sasha Lianna", "last_name_ssi": "Perkins", "middle_name_ssi": "Lianna", "first_name_ssi": "Sasha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Coray M Colina", "Paul C Painter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Coray M Colina, Thesis Advisor", "Paul C Painter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Deep eutectic solvents", "ionic liquids", "choline chloride", "fourier transform infrared spectroscopy", "hydrogen bonding"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Mathematical Reasoning of Teachers During the Design and Delivery of Instruction", "id": "24937", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11133", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Much attention in recent years has been given to the nature of the mathematical knowledge of teachers.

The fauna of the middle Upper Ordovician Salona and Coburn Formations of the Trenton group carbonates were investigated to quantitatively study community compositions along a deep subtidal to offshore gradient.  The deep subtidal through offshore biofacies have previously been under-sampled, so detailed examination of these strata provides much needed quantitative community data.  High resolution (5 cm scale) stratigraphic analysis, coupled with extensive fossil collection from several exposures in central Pennsylvania, allows for identification of biofacies through cluster analysis, and faunal depth preferences through detrended correspondence analysis (DCA).  These biofacies, and the ecologic preferences of their taxa, were then compared with previously reported collections from the Trenton Falls area of New York, and central Kentucky near Frankfort. While several comparable biofacies were identified, most did not have obvious counterparts in other collections.  Those that were comparable varied greatly between locales, despite a high degree of taxonomic overlap.  Ecological parameters of individual taxa were similarly not highly conserved, and all three locales contained numerous endemic taxa.

Results of the most recent studies have suggested that previously accepted idea about cognitive abilities for individuals with autism may be inaccurate.  One reason for these mixed finding may be that the levels of communication and social skills vary greatly for individuals with ASD, and these variations can have powerful effects on the scores obtained on measures of intellectual abilities.  One method of controlling for these specific variables may be through computerized testing, which research findings have demonstrated to be associated with higher scores on tests of executive functioning and working memory for individuals with autism but not for neurotypical individuals.  Computer-based testing controls for the social and verbal aspects of the testing process, which are factors that may be affecting scores for individuals with autism, but not for others. \nThe current study used three measures to discriminate the causes of score discrepancies: a verbal measure, a nonverbal measure that incorporates a social component, and a computerized test that has no social component and only a minimal verbal component. The scores were analyzed to find which one best predicts academic achievement and is the optimal measure of cognitive ability. \nThe results indicated that no significant difference exists between scores obtained from each IQ test or in each test\u2019s ability to predict either math or reading achievement; however, qualitative analysis indicated that differences may exists between scores of students with IQ scores below 70, but not for those with IQ scores above this level.

Fiscal data was collected from the Pennsylvania Department of Education web site for all five hundred public school districts in the state.  Secondary sources were also utilized to determine the impact of policy, legislative actions, and overall economic variables on fiscal elements specific to the public school finance landscape during the period of study.  Analysis of key fiscal elements and secondary information was completed for all public school districts and further examined by average district wealth through decile information.\n\tThis study found that between 2008-2013, fiscal responses and patterns changed due to revenue and expenditure variables for the aggregate group of Pennsylvania districts and differed for these districts based on average wealth.  Key findings of this study included:\n1.  State policy decisions and legislative actions, specifically the reduction of state funding and lack of full restoration that coincided with the infusion and elimination of federal ARRA funding, had adverse effects on total school district revenues, especially 2011-12.\n\n2.  The recession of 2007-2009, along with limitations on local real estate tax increases imposed by Act 1 of 2006, restricted the ability for school districts to raise local revenue in order to counterbalance state revenue decreases, especially in 2011-12 when the Act 1 base index reached a five year low of 1.4%.\n\n3.  Increased benefit expenditures, due primarily to increased mandatory payments to PSERS, constrained the ability for school districts to meet overall obligations and forced challenging decisions, especially from 2011-13, when employer contribution rates increased from 5.54% to 12.36%.\n\n4.  State policy decisions and legislative actions, with regards to the interaction of state and federal revenues, adversely affected poorer districts to a greater degree than wealthy districts, counter to the intent of how those revenues were designed to be allocated.\n\n5.  The decrease of total revenue and increase of mandatory expenditures, specific to benefits, adversely affected poorer districts to a greater degree than wealthy districts, in the ability to meet rising costs associated with staff, more often forcing decisions fiscally necessary, but not educationally sound.\n\n6.  With mandatory expenditures projected to rise, as employer contribution rates to PSERS continues to rise, school districts will face further challenges in the future in an Act 1 environment, unless future policy and legislative actions provide relief in the form of increased state funding, equitable allocation and overall pension reform.  \n\nFindings assert that long-range fiscal planning is paramount when addressing school district fiscal needs and that managing costs such as collective bargaining agreements and competing in a choice environment, given Charter School Costs, are important in managing the balance between revenues and expenditures.  Future research aligned to further exploration of legislative impacts on school funding along with possible reform efforts specific to the state pension system and revenue generated through local real estate taxes will emerge in the coming years as key focus areas for understanding and practice.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11606], "author_name_tesi": "Perrin, Jason Christom", "last_name_ssi": "Perrin", "middle_name_ssi": "Christom", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Hartman", "William Hartman", "Edward J Fuller", "Ronald Robert Musoleno", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "William Hartman, Committee Chair", "Edward J Fuller, Committee Member", "Ronald Robert Musoleno, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pennsylvania Public School Finance", "Revenues", "Expenditures", "Fund Balance", "Average District Wealth"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "From the McCarthy Era to \"Gangsta Rap\": The Rhetoric of Popular Music and Moral Panic in America", "id": "19541", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9345", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Popular music has been under attack since the formation of the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1938, and the mobilization of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) in the 1980s marked a transformative moment in the on-going cultural struggle over popular music in America.  For this study, I analyze how it was that popular music became the target of cultural crusaders who claimed that it threatened Americans, especially young people.  In order to do this, I evaluate the actual music that, at four points in history, has been criticized as a threat to the moral foundation of America: the music of Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger during the Red Scare; Elvis Presley and the introduction of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll during the 1950s; the \u201cporn rock\u201d criticized by the PMRC in the 1980s; and finally, the controversy about \u201cgangsta rap\u201d in the 1990s.

While opinions of wine professionals can be influential on a wine\u2019s prestige, of equal importance are opinions of wine consumers, who are the driving force behind sales. For these reasons, preferences for these compounds were assessed by both non-expert wine consumers and wine experts.\nThe first objective of this work was to determine the hypothesized matrix effects on detection thresholds for MA and 2AAP in water, model wine, and wine. A group of untrained participants who reported consuming white wine were used to determine the detection thresholds for MA and 2AAP, in each of the three matrices. Additionally, threshold values for MA and 2AAP, previously cited in the literature, were evaluated using the same participants to investigate their reported 2-log difference.\nThe second objective of my work was to determine how the concentration levels of MA and 2AAP affect consumer and wine expert preferences by assessing rejection thresholds for each of the two compounds in an unoaked Chardonnay. I hypothesized that wine experts would have a lower rejection threshold than non-expert wine consumers. Additionally, I investigated how regional location may affect rejection threshold by comparing the results acquired from California wine experts and non-expert wine consumers to Pennsylvania non-expert wine consumers. I expected that the rejection threshold for the two compounds would be lower among CA residents, who are unfamiliar with wines of a grapy nature, compared to PA residents, who are likely familiar with labrusca wine. \nThe results of this research provide critical information about the detection of the potentially undesirable odors of methyl anthranilate and 2-aminoacetophenone in wine. The proven matrix effects suggest that at low levels, the detection of these compounds may be dependent on grape variety. With the knowledge of which levels of MA and 2AAP in their wines are detectable, but not necessarily of consequence to purchase decisions, PA winemakers can save time and money and propel the PA wine industry forward, well past the bad press that equates PA wines with \u2018alcoholic grape juice.\u2019 ", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11724], "author_name_tesi": "Perry, Demetra M", "last_name_ssi": "Perry", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Demetra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John E Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John E Hayes, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["labrusca", "methyl anthranilate", "2-aminoacetophenone", "detection threshold", "rejection threshold", "alternative forced-choice"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Discovery and Characterization of the BMP4-mediated Stress Erythroid Response to Acute Anemia", "id": "6806", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acute anemia results in the rapid mobilization and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the adult spleen.  flexed-tail (f) mice exhibit normal steady state erythropoiesis but are unable to rapidly respond to acute erythropoietic stress.  Analysis of the f locus shows that the mechanisms that regulate expansive erythropoiesis are distinct from the mechanisms that regulate steady state erythropoiesis.  We show that f/f mice have a mutation in Madh5, which impairs signaling downstream of the BMP4 receptor.  Further analysis of mutant and control mice demonstrates that during the recovery from acute anemia, BMP4 expression is induced in the spleen, which drives the differentiation of a BMP4 responsive progenitor into an Epo responsive stress BFU-E.  Stress BFU-E rapidly form large colonies in the presence of Epo alone, which distinguishes them from steady state bone marrow BFU-E.  These findings suggest a new model where stress BFU-E in the spleen are poised to respond to changes in the microenvironment induced by acute anemia. \n\tAnalysis of the stress erythroid response has also demonstrated the importance of SCF/Kit signaling, which we show to be necessary for the normal stress BFU-E response.  BMP4 responsive cells express Kit on their surface and previous work in the field has shown that mice mutant for the Kit receptor (W/WV) are slow to recover from acute anemia.  Although W/WV mice are chronically anemic, they do not constitutively express BMP4; however, they rapidly up-regulate BMP4 expression in response to phenylhydrazine treatment.  Despite rapid induction of BMP4, the expansion of stress BFU-E is significantly delayed.  Unlike control mice, W/WV mice do not maintain a pool of BMP4 responsive cells in the spleen.  In vitro analysis reveals that BMP4 and SCF play distinct roles in the response to acute anemia.  BMP4 treatment increased the number of stress BFU-E, while SCF affected the size of the stress BFU-E-derived colonies.  These results demonstrate that, while BMP4 regulates the differentiation of stress BFU-E, SCF/Kit signaling regulates the expansion of stress BFU-E progeny.  Furthermore, we found that hypoxia increases both colony number and size, and hypoxia synergizes with SCF in order to further increase colony number.  In vitro treatment of spleen cells with hypoxia, SCF and BMP4 recapitulate the stress BFU-E expansion observed in vivo in response to acute anemia. \n\tFurther characterization of the stress erythroid response demonstrates that BMP4 responsive cells and stress BFU-E do not self-renew in the spleen but must be replenished by bone marrow progenitors.  Bone marrow-derived progenitors are found to give rise to BMP4 responsive cells and stress BFU-E upon exposure to the splenic microenvironment.  Desert hedgehog is highly expressed in the spleen and is a potential candidate signal for converting bone marrow progenitors into BMP4 responsive cells.  We show that exposure of bone marrow cells to Sonic hedgehog protein induces BMP4 expression as well as the expansion of stress BFU-E.  Also, unlike controls, Smoothened mutant bone marrow cells, which are unable to transmit hedgehog signals, are incapable of giving rise to BMP4 responsive cells in the spleen.  Together, our data demonstrate that certain bone marrow progenitors differentiate into BMP4 responsive cells upon exposure to hedgehog signals in the spleen and serve to replenish BMP4 responsive cells which have been exhausted during the recovery from acute anemia.  \n\tThe discovery and characterization of stress BFU-E provides a new model for the response to acute anemia.  Induction of BMP4 in the spleen following acute anemia results in the differentiation of BMP4 responsive cells into stress BFU-E.  Hypoxia and SCF serve to increase the number and size of stress BFU-E and together with BMP4 are responsible for the stress BFU-E response to acute anemia.  This stress BFU-E response is then replenished by bone marrow progenitors which become BMP4 responsive cells upon exposure to hedgehog signals in the spleen.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2877], "author_name_tesi": "Perry, John Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Perry", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Pamela J Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stress erythropoiesis", "erythropoisis", "acute anemia", "BMP4"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Toward a Learning Model of Information Technology Implementation", "id": "7348", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3041", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study focuses on the mutual adaptation process that occurs when a new technology is implemented in a team environment and how learning during the adaptation process affects a team\u2019s technology usage.

Research implies the chilly classroom climate is especially a problem for female students in engineering.  This research project focused on the classroom climate for female engineering students in the hopes to identify strategies to recruit, enroll and retain more women in this field.\nThis study examined the relationships between women\u2019s level of gender identity, learning styles preference, and perceptions of the classroom environment and how these factors affected each other as well as their collective influence on women\u2019s self-reported level of classroom involvement in core engineering courses.  Participants were 146 undergraduate female engineering students from the University Park campus, of The Pennsylvania State University.\nThe study included four assessment instruments and one demographic information sheet.  The demographic information sheet obtained relevant background information, including race/ethnicity, age, major, class standing, cumulative GPA, and socioeconomic status.  The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Form M assessed students\u2019 learning style preference.  The Salter Environmental Type Assessment (SETA) Experimental Form B was used to assess students\u2019 perceptions of the classroom environment.  The Gender Interconnection Scale (GIS) measured the students\u2019 gender connection to men and women.  The Classroom Involvement Survey (CIS) was designed to assess the level of students\u2019 participation in classroom environments focusing on their self-reported behaviors pertaining to involvement.  Classroom involvement included aspects of student participation in and out of class.\nStepwise regression analysis was used to determine whether the independent variables (learning style, classroom environment and gender connection) explained a statistically significant amount of variance in the dependent variable (students\u2019 level of classroom involvement).  The initial, fully saturated regression model was a significant model, which accounted for 48% of the variance in the dependent variable, level of student classroom involvement.  However, because all independent variables that were entered into the initial regression equation were not significant, a reduced or more parsimonious model was developed.  Three factors were significant variables in explaining variance in the level of classroom involvement.  The SETA-TF, GIS Male and SETA-EI dimensions explained 45% of the variance as indicated by the R2 value of .448 and an F-value of 38.40 (p < .001).\nThe regression results were consistent with previous findings that indicate higher SETA-TF values were associated with higher perceived classroom involvement values.  The SETA-TF variable explained 40% of the variance in the dependent variable, classroom involvement.  In other words, the more \u201cfeeling\u201d oriented classrooms resulted in statistically significantly more self-reported student involvement.  The GIS variable explained 3.3% of the variance in the dependent variable and was significant at the .007 level.  The regression results indicated that higher GIS male interconnection values were associated with higher perceived classroom involvement values.  Women who identified more with men had higher classroom involvement values than women who identified more with women.  The SETA-EI variable approached statistical significance and explained .3% (p = .051) of the variance in the dependent variable, classroom involvement.  The regression results indicate that as SETA\u2013EI values increased, classroom environment values decreased.  In other words, students participated more in extraverted classes.  \nBased on the results of this study, strategies for creating warmer, more extraverted and feeling oriented classroom environments that are more open and encouraging to student involvement are discussed.  Such environments can make a significant difference in the recruitment, enrollment and retention of engineering students and especially for women engineering students.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [525], "author_name_tesi": "Persaud, Anita ", "last_name_ssi": "Persaud", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anita", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counselor Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel W Salter", "James B Stewart", "Catharina Johanna Cunning", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Robert B Slaney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel W Salter, Committee Chair", "James B Stewart, Committee Member", "Catharina Johanna Cunning, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Robert B Slaney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["classroom involvement", "chilly classroom climate", "classroom environment", "gender identity", "gender interconnection", "learning styles"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Expanding the Moral Domain:\nEnvironmental Moral Reasoning \nin Outdoor Recreation Contexts\n", "id": "6944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2983", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main purpose of this study was to determine what types of environmental moral reasoning (i.e., egocentric/anthropocentric or biocentric) are regarded as most salient among young adults in making a decision to act in an environmentally-sensitive manner while engaged in four separate outdoor recreation activities (i.e., hiking, picnicking, fishing, lake swimming).

Like symptoms of anxiety, obsessive compulsive symptoms are also present to some degree in most people. Epidemiologic studies have consistently shown that .7-19% of the general population, world-wide, meet diagnostic criteria for obsessions and/or compulsions (Apter et al., 1996; Valleni-Basile et al., 1994; 1996; Zohar et al., 1992). Yet, there has been little systematic investigation of the presentation of adolescent OC behavior in the school settings and very little is known about how varying degrees of obsessive compulsive traits affect psychosocial functioning of school-aged youth. In addition, research has also suggested that people who experience obsessions and compulsions and that young people in general, rarely seek professional mental health services to relieve their obsessive compulsive symptoms. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the influence of OC behaviors on school functioning and help seeking practices in a general population of high school students. Participants included 1,098 high school students, ranging in age 13-20 years. The findings from these data suggest that a majority of adolescents in a large suburban high school experience obsessive compulsive behaviors. The results of this investigation parallel clinical observations in that obsessive compulsiveness is associated with significant and relatively pervasive impairments in functioning and influence help seeking behaviors of non-referred youth (Goodwin, Koenen, Hellman, Guardino, & Struening, 2002; Placentini, Bergman, Keller, & Mc Cracken, 2003; Valderhaug, & Ivansson, 2005).

Nevertheless, understanding the relationship between fractures\u2019 void structure and the associated macroscopic transport properties remains limited. The objective of this study is to examine both single-phase flow and capillary-dominated displacement in a rough-walled fracture. A commercially available computational fluid dynamics software was used to investigate single-phase flow. A physically-based percolation model was developed to study capillary-dominated displacement, and validated by using previous experimental data as a modeling reference. \n\nKnowledge of detailed descriptions of a fracture from Computed Tomography (CT) measurement was used for generating a realistic fracture replica. Single-phase flow simulations were carried out on the CT-scanned fracture by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. The effects of fracture roughness and path tortuosity were explored by visualizations of pressure contours and vector velocity profiles of flows thorough the realistic fracture. The results of CFD simulations were compared against predictions using idealized smooth fractures or parallel plate models. Noticeable discrepancies showed that the cubic law was inadequate in describing flows in fractures because of lack of a valid physical representation of a real fracture. The deviations of the cubic law predicting flow in a real fracture can be corrected by applying a scaling factor to its hydraulic conductivity.\n\nA modified invasion percolation (MIP) approach was developed to model primary drainage.  A detailed fracture structure and fluid distribution maps were obtained from previous experiments using X-ray computed tomography; these results were used as reference for validating the proposed model. Parameters representing fracture characteristics are mean aperture, standard deviation and spatial correlation length. The effect of these three parameters on fracture capillary pressure curves were quantified relative to the entry pressure and the irreducible water saturation. The results show that the geostatistical parameters are strongly related to the magnitudes of the entry pressure and the irreducible water saturation. Geostatistical analysis elaborates on the correspondence between structure characteristics of fractures, preferential flow channeling and fracture capillary pressure curves, thus providing a methodology to predict fracture capillary pressure from fracture aperture parameterization. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6340], "author_name_tesi": "Petchsingto, Tawatchai ", "last_name_ssi": "Petchsingto", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tawatchai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Turgay Ertekin", "Abraham S Grader", "Derek Elsworth", "Maira Lopez De Murphy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Abraham S Grader, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Maira Lopez De Murphy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Young-Laplace equation", "aperture distribution", "geostatistical parameter", "fractured rock", "invasion percolation theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "FERROELECTRIC TERPOLYMERS, BASED ON SEMICRYSTALLINE VDF/TRFE/CHLORO-CONTAINING TERMONOMERS: SYNTHESIS, ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES, AND FUNCTIONALIZATION REACTIONS\n", "id": "6091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "529", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past decades, many researches have devoted their efforts related to PVDF and VDF/TrFE copolymers to the general goal of reducing the Curie temperature, narrowing the polarization hysteresis loop, and generating a large electromechanical response at ambient temperature. The direct correlation between reduced polar domain size and lower energy barrier, shown in ferroelectric ceramic materials, led to many attempts to alter copolymer morphology. The methods include mechanical deformation, electron irradiation, uniaxial drawing, and crystallization under high pressure or high electric field. By using these physical methods, many shortfalls have been addressed such as the limitation of the processability of the material, the instability of the crystal phase, the extremely high electric field in the strain measurement. \nIn this thesis, a new chemical method is performs, by incorporating the small amount (~7 mol %) of the chloro-containing termonomers, including chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), 1,1 and 1,2-chloro-fluoroethylene (CFE), 1-chloro-2,2-difluoro ethylene (CDFE), into VDF/TrFE copolymer chains. Along with this study, we also synthesize a functional fluoropolymer that contains the functional group on either one end or both ends, and their diblock or triblock copolymers. The long term objective is to utilize these reactive functional groups to connect fluoropolymer with other materials to further improve the electrical properties of the terpolymers.   \nA novel polymerization method involves a combination of a low temperature borane/oxygen initiator and a bulk polymerization process. This process allows the thorough mixing of all monomers during the terpolymerization reaction, resulting in the homogeneous distribution of the termonomer units in the polymer chain.  A chloro-containing termonomers, especially CDFE and CTFE, having comparative reactivity ratios with VDF and TrFE, lead to terpolymers with relatively narrow molecular weight and composition distributions. The homogeneous incorporation of the chloro-containing termonomers in the VDF/TrFE copolymer chain is crucial in modifying its polymer chain conformation and crystal structure. With ~7 mol% of the termonomer units, the copolymer alters its crystalline phase from the  ferroelectric \u0192\u00d2 phase (all-trans conformation) toward another ferroelectric \u0192\u00d7 phase (tttg+tttg- conformation), without significant reduction of the overall crystallinity. The new ferroelectric \u0192\u00d7 phase of the terpolymer, with shorter trans-sequence and smaller crystalline domains, reduces the Curie phase transition temperature since it has a much smaller energy barrier for phase transition. The unique combination in this new ferroelectric \u0192\u00d7 phase, with a small energy barrier and the large unit expansion or contraction during the crystal phase transition, results in high electromechanical response and behaves like a ferroelectric relaxor. The terpolymer shows high dielectric constant, as high as 100, with narrow hysteresis and high field-induced longitudinal strain (up to 4-5% at 150 MV/m) at ambient temperature.\nFor the functionalization of fluoropolymer, the telechelic VDF/TrFE/chloro-containing terpolymers having functional (polar and reactive) terminal groups, and triblock copolymers containing a VDF/TrFE/chloro-containing terpolymer and functional polymers was developed. These telechelic and block polymers not only provide interactive properties but also preserve the existing desirable properties due to the undisturbed polymer backbone.  Two chemical methods have been studied, including (i) the use of functional borane/oxygen initiators that carry functional groups and exhibit living radical polymerization mechanism, and (ii) the investigation of an improved iodine transfer polymerization (ITP) method to prepare telechelic fluoropolymers containing two terminal iodine groups. The former method although has some advantages in terms of ease and high purity of the polymer with the desirable reactive functional groups such as acetyl (can be converted to hydroxy group), silane and bromine groups, the polymerization yield is not very high due to the intramolecular interaction between the boron atom and the functional groups. The latter method, the iodine transfer polymerization (ITP), provides a very effective method with high yield, good catalyst efficiency, and well-defined telechelic polymer structure with two reactive terminal iodine functional groups on both chain ends. The chemistry involved an improved iodine transfer polymerization process using the combination of the AIBN imitator and a diiodo-compound chain transfer agent. Both initiation systems also show a living radical polymerization characteristic leading to the well-defined polymer with narrow molecular weight and composition distribution. The living characteristic was demonstrated by the block copolymerization of the terpolymer with the non-fluoropolymer (such as the PMMA homopolymer), or the fluoropolymer (including the PVDF homopolymer and the VDF/TrFE copolymer). The material from the latter case is very useful in terms of the improvement of the mechanical strength of the terpolymer.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [526], "author_name_tesi": "Petchsuk, Atitsa ", "last_name_ssi": "Petchsuk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atitsa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tze Chiang Chung", "Ian Roland Harrison", "James Patrick Runt", "Kenji Uchino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tze Chiang Chung, Committee Chair", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chloro-containing termonomers", "Fluoropolymer", "Functionalization", "Ferroelectrics", "VDF", "TrFE", "synthesis and electrical properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Experiencing the Transition from Classroom Teacher Leader to the Designated Leadership Role of Instructional Coach\n", "id": "27569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12201", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a multiple case study, with phenomenological underpinnings, of a group of teachers moving from their role as classroom teachers to the designated teacher leadership role of instructional coach.

Using a framework adopted from the literature on teacher leadership, this study illuminates the conditions and factors that impacted the development of the instructional coaches as they began to function as teacher leaders in new schools and in the classrooms of other teachers. Previous studies examined coaching relationships with student achievement and professional development, but few studies have looked at the growth and change that takes place in the instructional coaches themselves.  \nSeveral claims were made through this study.  One claim shown is that classroom teachers moving into a designated teacher leader role experienced many feelings and thoughts that were similar to those they had experienced as novice teachers, including an initially strong focus on self-concerns.  This claim is justified through the dialogue from logs and interviews shared by the participants in the study.  A second claim centered upon the context in which transitioning teacher leaders were placed.  It was highlighted in this study that navigating school cultures and building productive relationships with principals and other supervisors who had different leadership styles were some of the most challenging aspects for the participants in learning a new professional position.  Another claim made is that teacher leaders moving from the classroom experience challenges to their initial assumptions about teachers.  This initial assumption held by those experiencing this type of transition is that all teachers are reflective, inquiry oriented and agents of change.\n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11594], "author_name_tesi": "Peters, Brian Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Peters", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr.", "Bernard Joel Badiali", "Stephanie L Knight", "Jacqueline Edmondson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Bernard Joel Badiali, Committee Member", "Stephanie L Knight, Committee Member", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher leadership", "instructional coaching"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "NOVEL MODEL FOR LOADING BRAIN IRON IN MICE: IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDYING AGING AND AMYLOID PATHOLOGY", "id": "14665dzp146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14665", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Brain iron accumulation occurs normally in the aging brain to facilitate myelination of white matter (WM); neurotransmitter synthesis; and ATP production.  However, mishandling of iron may lead to early senescence and apoptosis because of impaired waste clearance, decreased cellular energy supply and increased oxidative stress.  During the aging process, iron accumulates in regionally specific brain areas: basal ganglia, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum that are clinically associated with the manifestations of brain dysfunction in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).  Both conditions are linked to iron imbalance. Recent work illustrates that amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein that is cleaved to form amyloid beta (A\u03b2), is important for iron clearance.  Dysfunction of APP may impair normal iron balance, and iron imbalance may increase A\u03b2 plaque genesis associated with AD.\nThis dissertation has explored the effect of dietary iron overload and deficiency in a wildtype control (C57BL6) and humanized APP knock-in mouse models (NL-F and NL-G-F), by using a small lipophilic iron molecule, TMHF.  We found TMHF in both the blood and brain of mice after dietary exposure.  Chronic TMHF exposure significantly increased brain iron in all animals by 15-35% within the hippocampus, cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.  Iron deficiency was only associated with decreased brain iron in the APP mutant mice.  In vivo MRI analysis and immunohistological findings support the notion that MRI relaxation (R2) is driven by iron deposition.  TMHF sustained the MRI WM volume fraction that decreased over time in the normal brain iron condition.  \nWM loss with aging may propagate free iron increases, contributing to AD A\u03b2 deposition.  APP synthesis is a common marker for WM damage and is found to be elevated in AD. This work found A\u03b240 clustering and dense A\u03b242 deposition near WM tracts. Although A\u03b242 saturation is not altered by brain iron load, A\u03b242 plaques was denser.  In contrast, A\u03b240 plaque load was shown to decrease over time with increasing brain iron accumulation.  Increased A\u03b242/40 ratio drives the proliferation of more hydrophobic oligomers that are believed to be more neurotoxic. The altered A\u03b242/40 ratio found in the setting of iron accumulation may differentiate a primitive/diffuse plaque from a senile cored plaque. This altered ratio may also explain the accelerated process of iron accumulation and subsequent amyloid plaque deposition noted in AD, when compared to the normal aging process. \nELISA analysis illustrates that TMHF iron linearly increases the iron storage protein, L-ferritin, to facilitate normal handling of elevated iron.  Despite the normative response to sequester toxic free iron, TMHF also elevated the protein markers for oxidative stress, inflammation and gliosis associated with AD pathology.  TMHF fed animals also developed impaired spatial learning as shown by Barnes maze testing. \nWith respect to iron dyshomeostasis, iron overload with TMHF increased A\u03b2 plaque iron and iron-rich microglia.  These iron inclusions may increase neurodegenerative processes during normal aging and disease.  Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and Perl\u2019s iron stain, we found regional heterogeneity of these iron deposits.  The content of iron-rich plaques had a higher A\u03b242/40 ratio and presented with more densely packed senile core-like features.  IBA1+ microglia were also found to have shorter branches, rounder bodies, and intense iron staining in the TMHF group. An increased phagocytic profile during amyloid deposition with increased brain iron may perturb microglial housekeeping functions in the brain. \nTaken together, we found that iron overload with TMHF increases brain iron in a physiologically normal and regionally specific manner.  Brain iron elevation increases WM volume, but it may also increase inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity of A\u03b2 plaques, all of which are linked to memory impairment in normal aging and AD. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15596], "author_name_tesi": "Peters, Douglas Gordon", "last_name_ssi": "Peters", "middle_name_ssi": "Gordon", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark David Meadowcroft", "James Robert Connor", "Qing X Yang", "Paul Eslinger", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark David Meadowcroft, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Qing X Yang, Committee Member", "Paul Eslinger, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Iron", "Aging", "MRI", "Histology", "Neurodegeneration"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Switching Language Dominance: What The Plasticity Of Language Change Within Bilinguals Tells Us About Language Processing And Cognition\n", "id": "14116", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7413", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "After extended immersion in a second language (L2) environment, some bilinguals become more proficient in the L2 than in the native language. This switch of language dominance can be observed under a variety of circumstances and at different points in the lifespan, e.g., following immigration or after growing up with a minority language and then entering school in which instruction is delivered in the majority language. Although there has been previous research on immersion experience, very little attention has been paid to switches of language dominance, either for language processing or for its cognitive consequences. The present study examined native Spanish speakers living in the US who have become proficient in English as the L2. Immersed in a largely monolingual environment, some bilinguals have become dominant in English, thereby switching language dominance. Spanish-English bilinguals who have switched language dominance in this context were compared to Spanish-English bilinguals who maintained dominance in Spanish and also to native English speakers with Spanish as the L2, and to monolingual speakers of English. Participants were given a set of language processing tasks and also cognitive measures to assess working memory and inhibitory control. Critically, the language processing tasks were those used in past research on immersion showing that at the lexical level, immersed L2 speakers inhibit their L1 (Linck et al., 2009) and at the sentential level, immersed L2 speakers adopt L2 parsing preferences when processing sentences in the L1 (Dussias & Sagarra, 2007). In the current study, participants named drawings of common objects, and performed a verbal fluency task, in which they produced as many exemplars of a specified category within 30 seconds (e.g., name fruits, animals, etc.). In addition, participants performed a self-paced reading task in English and Spanish, as a measure of syntactic processing. Gender-specific information within relative clauses were manipulated to force either high or low attachment. The use of specific gender information typically overrides other preferences but when a reader is forced to ignore the normally preferred strategy, there is a processing cost. The results reveal distinct consequences of language dominance for the lexicon and grammar. During the verbal fluency task, all bilingual groups produced more exemplars in their dominant language. That is, Spanish-English bilinguals who have become dominant in English name more exemplars of categories in English than their native language Spanish, unlike Spanish-English bilinguals, who remain dominant in Spanish, who show the opposite pattern, producing more exemplars in the native language. The findings of this study have implications for claims about the plasticity of the language system across an individual\u2019s life experience.

In particular, the molar concentration of H2O is found to be a significant factor for absorption predictions in the atmosphere. Using the Sutherland and Bass algorithm, the relative contribution of separate physical absorption mechanisms, including classical thermoviscous effects, rotational relaxation, and vibrational relaxation losses, are compared as a function of frequency and altitude. It is found that vibrational relaxation is the dominant loss mechanism over the frequency range of 125 to 1000 Hz at altitudes of 0 to 10 km. Although vibrational relaxation gives way to classical losses above 10 km, it is shown that carbon dioxide-induced vibrational relaxation contributes up to 14% of the total losses at 15 km altitude. To evaluate the impact of absorption coefficients for a propagating wave, cumulative absorption over a vertical propagation path can be calculated by numerical integration. It is shown that the discretization step sizes should be no greater than 1 km to avoid under sampling the absorption curves from 0 to 18 km altitude. Finally, dispersion is analyzed by calculating the phase speed increment due to O2, N2, CO2, and O3 as a function of altitude. Dispersion due to O2 accounts for approximately 85% of the phase speed increment from 0 to 18 km. At 0 km, the N2-induced phase speed increment accounts for the majority of the remaining 15%, but decreases with increasing altitude.

High sedimentation rates on the Catskill Delta combined with regularly avulsing fluvial systems likely led not only to an excellent taphonomic setting for preserving early tetrapods, large freshwater fish, and a variety of other fossil material, but also created a highly dynamic environment in which these organisms were interacting and evolving.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1312], "author_name_tesi": "Peterson, Daniel Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Peterson", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky, Thesis Advisor", "MARK E PATZKOWSKY, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluvial", "Devonian", "tetrapod", "avulsion", "Acadian orogeny", "Pennsylvania", "Red Hill", "stratigraphy", "floodplain", "paleosol", "sandstone"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF AGE AND SPEED ON COACTIVATION, VARIABILITY, AND JOINT KINETICS DURING WALKING", "id": "8806", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1570", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metabolic cost of walking (Cw), defined as the rate of oxygen consumed during walking per unit distance traveled, has been shown to be greater for the elderly than for young adults across a range of walking speeds (Ortega & Farley, 2007; Mian et al., 2006).  Several potential causes of increased Cw in older adults have been highlighted in current literature, including elevated antagonistic muscle coactivation, a proximal redistribution of lower limb work, and increased step width variability.  The purpose of this study was to investigate age and speed effects on these three variables as well as Cw, and to quantify the relationship between these variables and Cw.  Joint kinematics, joint kinetics, lower extremity electromyography, and Cw were measured for fourteen physically active older adults, and fourteen active young adults at four walking speeds (0.89, 1.12, 1.34, and 1.57 m\u2022s-1).  Older participants exhibited 23% higher Cw than young adults when averaged across walking speeds. Coactivation was significantly higher about the thigh but not the shank in older adults across all speeds tested.  Also, a proximal redistribution of joint work was noted in older adults, as this group exhibited less knee work and more hip work than young.  Ankle work, however, was similar between age groups.  Step width, step width variability, stride length, and stride length variability were all similar for the two age groups.  Cw was positively correlated with coactivation only.  Due to the elevated coactivation in older adults, as well as the positive correlations exhibited between this variable and Cw, it seems as if coactivation may be a factor in the increased Cw seen in older adults.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1554], "author_name_tesi": "Peterson, Daniel S", "last_name_ssi": "Peterson", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Martin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Martin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gait", "metabolic cost", "coactivation", "kinetics"]}]
