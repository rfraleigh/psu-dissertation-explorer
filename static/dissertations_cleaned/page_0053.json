Generation and interpretation of these experiments involve many steps, each of which can potentially affect the quality of the data, which in turn can affect the reliability of scientific interpretation. Several metrics and guidelines have been developed to assess the quality and reproducibility of ChIP-seq experiments. However, these methods apply to binding regions that are punctate and well separated and thus are not necessarily applicable to experiments with broad binding regions, such as histone modifications or DNase sensitivity sites. Visual inspection of the signal still remains the most reliable tool for quality evaluation especially for broad targets. However, visual inspection can be subjective in nature and since only a few loci are scanned it may not represent the global quality of the experiment.  To address these issues, in Chapter 2 of this dissertation we have developed a sampling-based approach to quantitatively evaluate the quality and reproducibility of ChIP-seq experiments. Our method is motivated from the observation that high-quality ChIP-seq data usually have reproducible binding profiles with distinctive contrast between signal and background. It makes use of the fact that sequencing data can be sampled and creates pseudo-replicates by sampling reads from the original samples. Data quality is measured using the consistency across pseudo-replicates and relative reproducibility is measured by comparing the consistency between real samples and pseudo-replicates derived from the real samples.  \nOur results indicate that quality metrics from our method are sensitive to various features affecting ChIP-seq data quality such as noise, sequencing depth and antibody quality. We have computed our quality metrics on over 400 publicly available unique datasets from the mouse ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics project. Evaluation of our quality metrics against the quality metrics from ENCODE consortia as benchmarks revealed that our metric is more sensitive and thus can assess quality more accurately.  In addition, we found that for the majority of datasets (both narrow as well as broad), our quality assessment agreed with the consortia but in cases of discordance our method frequently agreed with the visual inspection of quality. In particular our metrics perform better for non-sequence specific transcription factors (TF) that shows wider signals (example CHD1).  \nChapter 3 of this dissertation investigates biological questions using ChIP-seq datasets evaluated as high quality using the methods developed in Chapter 2. An unsolved question in biology is  how do morphologically and physiologically distinct cells in the human body contain the same blue print of three billion base pairs but still perform widely different functions.  Several recent genome-wide studies have revealed that dynamic changes in the locations and actions of transcription factors drive much of the differential gene expression that determines cell fate, morphology, and function. However, to-date most experiments to examine the dynamics of transcriptional regulation have focused on global mapping of one or more transcription factors, usually under two conditions. These studies do not reveal the kinetics of binding and hence its association with expression is not known at genome-wide level. In Chapter 3 of this dissertation, we have examined the dynamics of GATA1 (an essential erythroid TF) binding by ChIP-seq and the global expression responses by RNA-seq at seven time points in a GATA1-dependent mouse cell line model for erythroid maturation. \nIn the seven progressive stages during differentiation, we have identified 2,994 differentially expressed genes and 28,457 unique GATA1 binding instances. Analysis of binding revealed multiple temporal classes of binding patterns: (1) early binding, (2) late binding and (3) constitutive binding. Assigning GATA1 occupied sites (OSs) to their nearest gene revealed that induced genes tended to be bound later by GATA1 while repressed genes tend to be bound earlier by GATA1. However, the binding kinetics alone did not predict the response for the majority of responsive genes. Correlation of binding and expression revealed 1,765 GATA1 OSs, a majority (84%) of which were positively correlated and bound late in differentiation. Candidate target genes of late bound segments were enriched for induced genes that had erythroid function. The late bound GATA1 OSs were frequently co-occupied by co-factors of transcription activation complex, TAL1, LDB1 and KLF1. These results suggest that GATA1 primarily acts as an activator during erythroid differentiation. Candidate target genes of early bound segments on the other hand, were enriched for repressed genes that had megakaryocytic function. The early bound GATA1 OSs showed a loss of TAL1 and LDB1. These results suggest that early GATA1 binding may have a role in repressing the genes not required for erythroid function such as genes of the megakaryocytic lineage. Taken together, our results suggest that dynamics of GATA1 binding play a role in maintenance of erythroid lineage by repressing the megakaryocytic program and activating the erythroid program during erythroid differentiation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9322], "author_name_tesi": "Jain, Deepti Prakash", "last_name_ssi": "Jain", "middle_name_ssi": "Prakash", "first_name_ssi": "Deepti", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Qunhua Li", "Robert Paulson", "David Scott Gilmour", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Chair", "Qunhua Li, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GATA1", "Next generation sequencing", "Quality control", "reproducibility", "eryhtropoiesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Quality of Service Benefits of Flash in a Storage System\n", "id": "8590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3587", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  Virtualized storage systems can be shared by applications (workloads) with substantially different resource requirements, workload patterns, and levels of importance. In such a system, fairness can be defined as a metric that estimates how well the application throughputs match their assigned level of importance (i.e. relative weights). Furthermore, clients paying for storage as a service may expect a certain minimum level of performance from the virtualized system. In general, for a storage system, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the goal of achieving fairness and the goal of maximizing overall performance. Thus in a virtualized storage system, an important quality of service (QoS) goal is to try to optimize fairness, while also ensuring that the overall performance stays above a minimum acceptable threshold. \n\n  Storage performance is notoriously difficult to estimate in a storage system and varies significantly with workload characteristics. Due to the mechanical nature of a disk, a random workload achieves a lower throughput, and experiences a higher response time, than a sequential workload. As a result of this behavior, an algorithm that aims to achieve the aforesaid QoS goal, results in asymmetric fairness between a random and a sequential stream.\n\n  Flash is a storage device that has the potential of making storage systems independent of the effects of randomness in workloads, and thus of making the performance of virtualized storage systems more predictable. The scope of this thesis is to investigate how flash can be used to augment virtualized storage systems, in order to improve fairness, while also achieving sufficient minimum performance. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3567], "author_name_tesi": "Jain, Kanishk ", "last_name_ssi": "Jain", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kanishk", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["throughput", "fairness", "quality of service", "hybrid store", "flash", "storage system", "response time", "random", "sequential"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF ALTERNATIVE ROAD SALTS ON SOIL LEACHATE QUALITY", "id": "15149krj6", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15149", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In winter, stormwater runoff contains a high amount of salts mainly due to the application of deicing salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl) to melt snow and ice by lowering its freezing point.

This research experiment compared the impact of three alternative road salts to the traditional sodium chloride in terms of the flow rate of water through the soils, plus the retention of copper in soil.

The ligand for a CD8+ T cell receptor consists of a short peptide derived from a viral protein bound to a heterodimeric molecule encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Most MHC molecules are highly polymorphic, a property responsible for the extensive repertoire of peptides available for recognition by T cells; these MHC molecules are designated MHC-Ia. Given the dynamic interplay between a host\u2019s immune system and viruses, viruses often mutate antigenic peptides to prevent binding to MHC-Ia molecules and thereby evade recognition by antiviral CD8+ T cells. Recently, non- and oligo-morphic MHC-Ib molecules have been described as adept presenters of microbial peptides to CD8+ T cells across most outbred members of a given species. Our group recently uncovered a protective MHC-Ib-restricted CD8+ T cell response to mouse polyomavirus (MuPyV), a natural, persistent mouse pathogen; however, this response was only detected in mice lacking MHC-Ia molecules. In this study, we asked whether ablation of the dominant MHC-Ia-restricted viral peptide epitope in MuPyV-infected immunocompetent mice would allow emergence of CD8+ T cells specific for a minor MuPyV capsid protein derived epitope, Q9:VP2.139-147. This restriction element is part of the MHC-Ib family and is shared across inbred mouse strains with varying MHC-Ia alleles. To test the proposed hypothesis, we inoculated C57BL/6 mice intracerebrally (i.c.) with a mutant MuPyV lacking the dominant CD8+ T cell epitope Db:LT359. The i.c. route of inoculation causes robust recruitment of anti-MuPyV T cells to the brain, an organ targeted by the human JC polyomavirus to cause the often-fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Using this LT359null mutant virus and assessing T cell responses by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), we uncovered a strong MHC-Ib-restricted CD8+ T cell response to the Q9:VP2.139 epitope. Notably, VP2.139+ CD8+ T cells were observed in the infected brain, but not the spleen, although virus levels were similar in both organs. In contrast, MuPyV-specific CD8+ T cells recognizing subdominant MHC-Ia epitopes were detected in both the brain and spleen. The compensatory increase by a non-classical MHC-Ib-restricted CD8+ T cell population suggests that MHC-Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells may serve as a backup host defense mechanism for polyomaviruses infecting the CNS that mutate viral peptides presented by MHC-Ia molecules.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13991], "author_name_tesi": "Jaiprakash, Amrita ", "last_name_ssi": "Jaiprakash", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amrita", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aron Lukacher", "Patricia McLaughlin", "Todd Schell", "James Connor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aron Lukacher, Thesis Advisor", "Patricia McLaughlin, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "James Connor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polyomavirus", "MHC", "MHC class Ib", "Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy", "Non-classical MHC", "Mouse Polyomavirus"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION AND MODELING OF CREEP BEHAVIOR IN AMBIENT TEMPERATURE CURED THERMOSET RESIN\n\n\n", "id": "12316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Externally bonding fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites to existing structures as a method of increasing strength is a quick and convenient retrofitting technique for structurally deficient structures. FRP strengthening systems typically utilize an ambient cured epoxy resin as matrix as well as adhesive. Ambient cured epoxies may have a glass transition temperature (Tg) close to the service temperature. The Tg being close to service temperature results in increased rate of physical aging which in turn results in the evolution of material properties. At temperatures close to Tg, creep deformation in the epoxy resin is also magnified. Hence it is important to characterize the Tg and creep behavior in the constantly evolving ambient cured epoxy resin. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were utilized to study the Tg evolution with age of epoxy. For a 7-day-old epoxy the onset of glass transition was around 40\u00b0C. An increase in Tg of almost 15\u00b0C was observed between a 7-day-old resin specimen and a specimen aged 100 days at room temperature, based on the dynamic storage modulus. The differences in various methods of assigning Tg mechanical and thermal testing was also observed. To gain understanding of the increase in Tg with material age, cure kinetics and physical aging kinetics models for the epoxy resin were developed. Physical aging at ambient temperature was identified as the reason for the increase in Tg of the resin. An \u201cextent of aging\u201d parameter was proposed to parameterize the evolution of epoxy resin towards equilibrium at the aging temperature. To characterize the creep response, tensile tests of plain epoxy coupons were done at ages of 7, 30 and 100 days at three different temperatures\u201422\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C. As the specimen aged, it became stiffer and creep compliance and creep rate decreased dramatically for given testing temperatures. The knowledge of physical aging kinetics was utilized to link the mechanically observed creep behavior to \u201cextent of aging\u201d parameter. The novelty of this technique is in the ease with which aging can be characterized for a complex thermal history of polymer which governs its creep behavior. The advantage of using this technique over preceding work to model non-isothermal aging is that creep response is not derived from parameters of a structural recovery model but a more tangible experimentally measured quantity. A MATLAB based code was developed based on this technique to predict the creep behavior of resin aged at 22\u00b0C for a variable time and then subjected to creep loading at different temperatures. The predictions of the analytical model were in good agreement with the experimentally observed creep behavior for most of the cases, particularly in terms of creep rate at times greater than 50 hours.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [504], "author_name_tesi": "Jaipuriar, Anurag ", "last_name_ssi": "Jaipuriar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anurag", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles E Bakis", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor", "Charles E Bakis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glass Transition temperature", "Physical Aging", "Cure kinetics", "Epoxy polymer", "Creep"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Statistically-based Air Blast Load Factors Based on Imprecised Parameter Statistics for Reinforced Concrete Wall", "id": "24042", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The determination of acceptable air blast load factors for Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) is complicated due to highly variable loads and to non-linear and rate dependent material and structural response that can result.

A precise distribution of random variables also has been required for load and resistance factor determination in LRFD. However, in the case where their distributions are uncertain due to insufficient data, such as for blast events, assumptions will be made that overlook uncertainties that should be accounted in the derivation. In this study, a combination of Response Surface Metamodels (RSM), Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS), and Probability Box (P-Box) that incorporate nonlinear finite element models were used to derive statistically-based blast load factors for LRFD. Load factor development centered on a case study involving a reinforced concrete (RC) cantilevered wall subjected to free air blasts.

The complexity of the problem grows quickly with the number of attributes to be matched and also due to multiple semantics of data values used in the real-world. Traditional research has tackled schema matching and value mapping independently, and, mainly, for categorical (discrete-valued) attributes. In this thesis, novel methods that leverage value mappings to enhance schema matching in the presence of opaque column names for schemas consisting of both continuous and discrete-valued attributes are discussed. Additional sources of confounding are that a) a discrete-valued attribute in one schema could in fact be a quantized version of a continuous-valued attribute in the other schema, and b) a continuous-valued attribute in one schema could in fact be a transformed version of a continuous-valued attribute in the other schema. In this approach, the fitness objective for matching a pair of attributes from two schemas exploits the statistical distribution over values within the two attributes. Suitable fitness objectives are based on Euclidean-distance and data log-likelihood, both of which are applied in experimental evaluations. A heuristic local descent optimization strategy that uses two-opt switching to optimize attribute matches, while simultaneously embedding value mappings, is applied for one-to-one or onto matching. A top-K schema matching strategy is developed where a top-K set of schema matches is first generated and statistical hypothesis testing is then applied to identify confident matches. This strategy is further utilized to handle partial schema matchings. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques achieve mixed continuous and discrete-valued schema matching with high accuracy and, thus, should be useful additions to a framework of (semi) automated tools for data alignment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7709], "author_name_tesi": "Jaiswal, Anuj Rattan",

resources and avoiding direct\nnutrient discharge from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to surface waters.\nThe crop fields and forested areas of the Penn State Living Filter (LF) site\nhave been irrigated with MWE from the Penn State University WWTP since 1983.\nThe dynamics of soil test phosphorus (STP) of crop fields irrigated with MWE\nwere studied to: (1) evaluate agronomic availability of P measured by Mehlich-3\nextractable soil P (M3P), and (2) to assess the potential for environmental P\nlosses from the LF site. Depth profiles of M3P were evaluated to estimate the\ntime required to saturate a given depth of the surface soil with respect to P.\nThe Pennsylvania P-Index (PA-PI) scores of the irrigated crop fields were\ndetermined to assess the sustainability of the MWE irrigation under P-based\nnutrient management. </p>\n\n<p class=NormalUndented><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>The\nM3P data of the plow-layer of irrigated crop fields from 1983 to 2009 were\nfitted to a two-phase regression model in order to describe the long-term\ntrends, which were subsequently interpreted on the basis of P application with\nMWE irrigation and soil properties. Soil chemical changes induced by long-term\nirrigation of MWE have altered the P sorbing properties. The surface soil\nequilibrium P concentration at zero sorption (EPC<sub>0</sub>) increased\nmarkedly from <1 to ~5.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> after a total P application of\n2528 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> from 1983 to 2008. The long-term trends exhibit a\nbiphasic behavior of M3P over 26 yr of system operation. After a ~9 yr initial\nbuildup, a marked decrease in the rate of M3P change has occurred. During\ninitial buildup phase, a total 12.4 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> were needed to\nincrease M3P by 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. After the buildup phase, the estimated\nquantity of P applied via MWE irrigation was slightly lower than the amount\nremoved with harvested crops and leached below the plow layer so that a quasi\nsteady-state condition exists with respect to M3P. Speciation modeling using\nVisual MINTEQ indicates complexation of Al by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at\nsoil pH conditions of the site. There appears to be a gradual loss in the P\nsorbing capacity of the surface horizon due to elution of Al, thereby resulting\nin enhanced displacement of applied P below the plow layer rather than\naccumulating in the surface horizon. Despite continuous P application with MWE\nirrigation in excess of fertility recommendations, the plow layer (0-20 cm)\naverage M3P has remained ~110 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for the last 17 yr.</p>\n\n<p class=NormalUndented><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span><span\nstyle='mso-tab-count:1'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>The depth profiles (0-7.5, 7.5-15,\n15-30, and 30-45 cm)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>of M3P from\ndifferent topographic positions (summit, side-slope, and depression) of crop\nfields, which received 14, 24, and 44 yr of MWE irrigation were studied to\nevaluate the spatial-temporal variation of M3P.

Enrichment of a subsoil layer is expected to occur rapidly if\nthe M3PSR of the overlying soil exceeds the threshold value. Using an average\nannual loading of 97 kg P ha<sup>-1</sup> over the site life and soil\nparameters of the unirrigated crop field at the LF site, roughly 16 yr of\ncontinuous MWE irrigation should saturate the top 30 cm of the surface soil.<sup><o:p></o:p></sup></p>\n\n<p class=NormalUndented><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>The\nPA-PI scores of the MWE-irrigated crop fields indicated that only two of the\ncrop fields of the site, which were located within 100 ft of the receiving\ntributaries, needed to have MWE application rates restricted by crop P removal\nin order to meet the Pennsylvania Natural Resources Conservation Service\n(PA-NRCS) nutrient management guidelines.

It is being used to predict cognitive abilities like intelligence, attention and even emotional regulation. Due to its enormous significance, we designed our study, aiming to understand the neural and functional bases of visual-spatial working memory. Visual-spatial working memory tasks are decomposed into encoding, maintenance and retrieval phases. We hypothesize that encoding of visual-spatial information is cognitively more challenging than retrieval of the information. This was tested by combining Electroencephalography (EEG) with a Virtual Reality (VR) paradigm to observe the modulation in EEG activity, alongwith brain areas activated using sLORETA, during encoding and retrieval. EEG power analysis results demonstrated an increase in theta activity during encoding in comparison to retrieval. The increase was predominant in right fronto-central regions of the brain. In contrast alpha activity was significantly higher for retrieval in right parietal, left central and occipital areas in comparison to encoding. This revealed that encoding required more cerebral efforts than retrieval, as past studies have clearly indicated that with increase in task demand theta synchronizes and alpha desynchronizes. Next, source localization results obtained from sLORETA indicated activity in Inferior frontal gyrus which is a part of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during encoding, whereas activation of Inferior Parietal lobule and Precuneus during retrieval. Studies have shown that activation in DLPFC occurs in response to increased cerebral challenge while posterior parietal areas represent a default network of the brain which is activated during tasks similar to conscious resting states. Based on these evidences we conclude that encoding of visual-spatial information is more challenging than retrieval. Also, we witnessed an encoding/retrieval flip i.e. disruption of default network of brain during encoding. Our results exhibited that encoding and retrieval utilized different neural substrates. Lastly, the pattern of brain areas activated during both, encoding and retrieval supported the concept of hemispheric laterality i.e., visual-spatial working memory tasks are localized in the right brain hemisphere. We hope that the results from our study would be extended to the clinical population and improve the understanding of visual-spatial deficits that are a normal occurrence post Head Injury, Stroke and even normal aging. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4701], "author_name_tesi": "Jaiswal, Niharika ", "last_name_ssi": "Jaiswal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Niharika", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov", "Semyon Slobounov", "Karl Maxim Newell", "William Ray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semyon Slobounov, Thesis Advisor", "Semyon Slobounov, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor", "William Ray, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["EEG", "working memory", "visual-spatial sketch pad", "sLORETA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Runtime Monitoring Tool for Monitoring Attack Surfaces in Programs using SELinux\n\n", "id": "10397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2047", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Attacks on computer systems have become quite common and sophisticated. They exploit vulnerabilities present in programs by injecting malicious code, changing program execution sequence by buffer overflow attacks and essentially affecting the program's integrity. These attacks are launched through the attack surface for the program. An attack surface for a program is the set of entry points which an attacker can use to launch attacks against it. The more features and more complex the program is, the greater its attack surface is. Hence a program with a larger attack surface is vulnerable to more threats from outside. Thus understanding and accurately measuring the attack surface is an important barometer for security of any program. This has been a challenging and an open problem in the security research community.  \n\n\tIn this thesis, we build a run time monitoring tool to measure and obtain an accurate assessment of the attack surfaces of the program using its access control policy. Since every entry point for a program could be a potential attack surface, merely identifying it would generate a lot of false positives. We use the integrity wall constructed using the program's access policy to classify MAC policy labels of the program into trusted labels and untrusted labels. This helps in identifying only those entry points  which allows untrusted labeled input to enter the program and hence are part of the attack surface. The run time monitoring tool collects all the interfaces where access happens between trusted and untrusted labels. Using this tool, we identify interfaces that have led to several known vulnerabilities. For the verb!httpd! web server we identified 56 interfaces of which 9 receive untrusted input. These entry points have been associated with a number of vulnerabilities which have been exploited by attackers.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2029], "author_name_tesi": "Jakka, Guruprasad ", "last_name_ssi": "Jakka", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guruprasad", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger", "Trent Ray Jaeger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger, Thesis Advisor", "Trent Ray Jaeger, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["security", "integrity", "attack surface", "program", "selinux", "policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Modeling Heterogeneous Geometry Problems Using New Capabilities of the High-Fidelity Neutron Transport Code PROTEUS", "id": "28819", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12147", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "PROTEUS is the high-fidelity deterministic neutron transport solver integrated in the multi-physics SHARP suite under NEAMS project, which provides heterogeneous geometry neutron transport capability for coupled multi-physics nuclear reactor applications.

Mutation of the Arabidopsis COPINE 1 gene (CPN1) causes a humidity sensitive lesion mimic phenotype with increased resistance to a bacterial and an oomyceteous pathogen, constitutive pathogenesis-related (PR) gene expression, and an accelerated hypersensitive cell death defense response (HR).  Low temperature also induces the lesion-mimic phenotype, increased disease resistance and constitutive PR gene expression in the cpn1-1 mutant.  CPN1 is a constitutively expressed gene in wild-type plants with increased expression under low humidity and low temperature conditions. Strong expression of CPN1 is observed in wild-type plants when infected with avirulent and virulent pathogens and by salicylic acid treatment. Copine proteins consist of a unique combination of two C2 domains at its N terminus and a VWA domain at the C terminus.  Over-expressing VWA domain fragment in wild-type plants resulted in a lesion-mimic phenotype with increased resistance to a bacterial pathogen.  The lesion-mimic phenotype could be due to the inhibition of the function of endogenous full length CPN1 by introduced excess VWA domain.  The npr1-1 mutation in cpn1-1 mutants did not affect the PR gene expression but delayed the lesion development. These results provide evidence that CPN1 in Arabidopsis may act as a suppressor of cell death and defense responses.  These results also show that CPN1 may play a role in the signaling events during plant acclimation to low humidity and low temperature conditions.  Taken together, these data suggest that CPN1 may represent a link between plant biotic and abiotic stress responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4743], "author_name_tesi": "Jambunathan, Niranjani ", "last_name_ssi": "Jambunathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Niranjani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Richard Cyr", "Dr Ramesh Raina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Chair", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Dr Ramesh Raina, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant abiotic response", "HR", "plant defense", "Arabidopsis", "cpn1-1", "copine", "Plant-pathogen"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Feeding Hungry People: An Investigation of US Food Assistance Programs", "id": "23563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10494", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many US households struggle to make sure all members have enough food for an active, healthy life.  The USDA describes such households that do not have enough as \u201cfood insecure,\u201d meaning that they were \u201cat times, unable to acquire adequate food for one or more household members because they had insufficient money and other resources for food\u201d (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2013: 4-8).  In 2012, USDA researchers estimated food insecure households accounted for nearly 20 percent of all US households.  They found that these households included about 33.1 million adults and 15.9 million children (Coleman-Jensen et al., 2013).\n\nTo help food insecure households get food, the US federal government intervenes in the country\u2019s economy.  These interventions are designed to alter the effects of poverty necessarily experienced by some of the people living in an economy that privileges exchange value, profits, and money income over the availability of basic use values, which includes household necessities.  These interventions consist of federally-funded programs that supply households falling below a specified income threshold with agricultural commodities, hot meals, and/or cash values in the form of an electronic benefit, essentially a debit card for food aid. \n \nI employ the exchange value concepts of supply and demand to examine the federal government\u2019s largest and most costly intervention in food security, the Food Stamp Program (FSP) or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  In 2011, the program aided an average of 44.7 million people each month, accounting  for about 75 percent of the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) total expenditures for domestic food assistance programs (approximately  $75 billion dollars).\n  \nThere are serious financial, political, and social limitations to the federal government\u2019s FSP and problems in general with the exchange value approach to people\u2019s food security.  My critique should not be construed as an argument for the discontinuance of food stamps (or SNAP), as this food aid is a vital resource for poor people. Instead, my critique is intended to highlight the need for alternatives to FSP in the long run. In their current form the federal government\u2019s assistance programs are large, expensive to operate, and financially unsustainable. Financial support for these programs varies depending on who is in power in Congress; individuals\u2019 food security should not be held hostage to the vagaries of Congressional politics.  Finally, program participants are caught up in a politics of race and class where frequent claims regarding welfare dependency, entitlement mentality, and poor work ethic disrespect them and rob them of their dignity.\n \nI propose an alternate and complementary use value approach to food security.  Specifically, I argue that household problems of food security may be resolved through the production of basic foods in proximity to poor people, which I refer to as a post-structural intervention.  I use a well-developed theory of bio-intensive farming to show that land, labor, and capital do not limit the ability of the poor to produce nutritious, affordably priced food in the city.

Higher levels of Surgency and Effortful Control were associated with less frequent use of food to soothe, while higher levels of Negativity were associated with greater use. The ECBQ may serve as an acceptable measure of temperament in toddlers as young as 12 months, but additional work is needed to determine its efficacy and developmental appropriateness in diverse samples.

Previous studies of postural coordination have shown phenomena such as bidirectional phase transitions and transfer of learning that are inconsistent with the established parallel effects in bimanual coordination.  The finding of stability in only the in-phase and antiphase patterns in postural coordination may have been confounded by methodological issues, including the analysis of group averaged data.  These issues were investigated by testing the hypothesis that there are different hierarchical control structures for redundant and non-redundant coordination tasks and by analyzing individual rather than group-averaged data.  In 3 Experiments participants performed a redundant and a non-redundant hip-ankle postural task under a range of experimental conditions.  The results showed that transfer between these tasks was negative, transitory and occurred only from the non-redundant task to the redundant.  Different timescales of change were found to operate within and between these hierarchical control structures.  It was also shown that the prior findings of only in-phase and antiphase coordination patterns in hip-ankle coordination were an artifact of the analysis of group-averaged data.  The majority of individuals used more than two coordination patterns in the redundant postural task.  The collective pattern of the findings led to the conclusion that: a) there are different hierarchical control structures for redundant and non-redundant coordination tasks; b) these control structures mediate the inconsistent findings previously found in these two types of coordination tasks, and c) different dynamics occur in each type of movement task which leads to the conclusion that the dynamics of the redundant task are different than those captured by the HKB model.

Several environmental factors play roles in maintaining low IgE levels.  Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to high IgE levels and allergic asthma incidence.  Allergic asthma is a disease of the lung characterized by strong Th2 driven airway inflammation and airway obstruction.  The immune system uses several mechanisms to limit inappropriate IgE responses.  The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in all immune cells.  VDR knockout (KO) mice have abnormally high circulating IgE levels.  Th2 cytokine IL-4 controls B cell class switching to IgE.  Uncontrolled IgE responses often occur after B cells have encountered excess T cell-derived IL-4 in result of IL-4 overproduction or cytokine imbalances.  The intestinal microenvironment harbors host immune cells that interact with commensal microbes to limit IgE levels and promote immune unresponsiveness to environmental antigens.  Other than being regulated by microbial signals, IgE production by B cells is not only self-restricted, but also limited by cytokines in an autocrine manner or from other immune cells.  In this work, we hypothesize that vitamin D regulates IgE levels through B cell intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that involve IL-10 and tolerogenic CD103+ dendritic cells (DC), but not commensal microbes.  The first objective of this research was to determine the major vitamin D targets during the IgE response to T-dependent antigens.  The second was to determine whether a cytokine imbalance occurs in VDR KO mice immunized with OVA in Alum.  Finally we determined whether there is a link between vitamin D and the microbiome in regulating IgE levels.  \nThe work presented here reveals a role for vitamin D in maintaining low IgE levels by regulating B cells.  The VDR is required for B cells to self regulate as they mount IgE responses to T dependent antigens.  Fewer IL-10-producing B (B10) cells respond to OVA during immunization.  VDR KO B cells overproduce IgE and fail to produce IL-10 in a context dependent manner.  VDR KO B10 cells have altered phenotypes suggesting functional defects in immunoregulation.  IL-10 mitigates the effects of VDR deficiency on the IgE response, indicating a modulatory role for IL-10 in IgE production.  Fewer tolerogenic CD103+ DCs are associated with hyper-IgE in VDR KO mice.  Commensal microbes do not contribute to hyper-IgE in VDR KO mice.  In healthy mice, vitamin D regulates B cells to maintain low IgE levels in a mechanism that possibly involves regulatory B10 cells.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11899], "author_name_tesi": "James, Jamaal L", "last_name_ssi": "James", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jamaal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Connie Jo Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Chair", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immunology", "Vitamin D", "Allergic asthma", "Immunoglobulin E"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Effect of Dietary Pretreatment and Obesity on (-)- Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg) Mediated Hepatotoxicity and the Underlying Mechanism\n", "id": "28937", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12500", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  A growing body of evidence suggests the hepatotoxic potential of high doses of EGCG. In vitro several mechanisms of EGCG cytotoxicity have been examined; however potential mechanisms of in vivo toxicity remain understudied. Additionally factors that can potentiate EGCG induced hepatotoxicity, such as pre-existing physiological conditions that attenuate liver function have not been investigated. With the lack of data to support an association between dietary supplements and liver toxicity, I hypothesized that dietary pretreatment with EGCG markedly decreases EGCG bioavailability and can potentially mitigate the toxic potential of EGCG, and that ORFLD increases susceptibility to high dose EGCG-mediated hepatotoxicity.  In addition to the effect of these factors on high dose EGCG hepatotoxicity, I further hypothesized that the underlying mechanism by which EGCG mediates hepatotoxicity is through induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress and increased mitochondrial dysfunction. \n  This study investigated the effect of dietary pretreatment with EGCG in male CF-1 mice. EGCG pretreated (EP) mice were pretreated with 3.2mg/kg EGCG in their diet for 2 weeks, a dietary dose that is equivalent to 500 mg/kg body weight. Non-pretreated (NP) and negative control (NC) mice were given a basal diet.  NP mice showed increased levels of ALT and phosphorylated histone 2Ax compared to control mice. Pretreatment with EGCG reduced these elevated levels. NP mice showed reduced levels of glutathione, which was partially ameliorated in EP mice. In addition to blunting the markers of oxidative stress dietary pretreatment enhanced hepatic level of antioxidant genes and reduced plasma and tissue concentrations of unconjugated EGCG indicating that EGCG impacted its own bioavailability. In summary, these results show that dietary pretreatment with EGCG reduced the bioavailability and hepatotoxic potential of subsequent acute high dose oral bolus EGCG.  \nIn another study we examined the effect of pre-existing obesity and ORFLD on EGCG-mediated hepatotoxicity in mice. EGCG treatment decreased survival rates of both lean and obese mice, but the effects were more pronounced in obese mice. EGCG caused increased liver injury as seen in elevated levels of liver ALT in all treatment groups. EGCG treatment increased DNA oxidative damage in both lean and obese mice. Markers of liver tissue damage assessed using histopathology showed that EGCG caused a dose dependent increase in tissue apoptosis, necrosis, hemorrhage, inflammation and hepatic lipidosis in both lean and obese mice.  Lipid peroxidation increased following EGCG treatment, and depleted glutathione levels were observed. Obese mice exhibited significantly lower levels of glutathione compared to lean mice indicating elevated levels of oxidative stress caused by EGCG treatment. This study showed that EGCG treatment caused hepatotoxicity in lean and obese mice in a dose dependent manner, with the effects being more pronounced in obese mice.\nOur third study examined the effects of EGCG on hepatic markers of antioxidant response and mitochondrial biogenesis/function in lean and obese mice. EGCG significantly reduced hepatic antioxidant capacity. Lean and obese mice showed reduce gene and protein expression, and activity of antioxidant enzymes. EGCG treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Sod2) mRNA levels in lean mice; as well as catalase mRNA levels in both lean and obese mice. Obese mice showed lower catalase activity and protein expression following EGCG treatment. A significant decrease in glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) protein expression was also seen. mRNA expression of glutathione transferase zeta 1 (Gstz1) and peroxiredoxin were significantly decreased by EGCG. In response to oxidative stress induced by EGCG, increases in gene expression of metallothionein transcription factor 1 (MTF-1) and metallothionein I and II were observed. Reduced antioxidant activity was a result of the impairment of antioxidant regulators by EGCG treatment. EGCG reduce mRNA levels of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), forkhead box O3 (Foxo3a) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf 2). EGCG treatment reduced mitochondrial biogenesis by decreasing mRNA levels of transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), co-activator peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor coactivator-1a (Pgc-1\u03b1) and mtDNA copy number in both lean and obese mice. EGCG impaired mitochondrial function by reducing gene expression of mitochondrial transcription factors A, (Tfam), B1 (Tfb1m) and B2 (Tfb2m), as well as subunits of mitochondrial Complex I and mitochondrial complex III. \n  Overall, based on our results and observations, EGCG treatment induced hepatotoxicity in lean and obese mice in a dose dependent manner and it induced oxidative stress by inhibiting antioxidant response. Mitochondrial function was impaired based on reduced biogenesis and inhibition of complexes following EGCG treatment. However, EGCG was shown to mitigate its toxic effects by reducing its own bioavailability following chronic dietary treatment. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11833], "author_name_tesi": "James, Karma Delores", "last_name_ssi": "James", "middle_name_ssi": "Delores", "first_name_ssi": "Karma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Ryan John Elias", "Gary H Perdew", "Jairam Kp Vanamala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Jairam Kp Vanamala, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["EGCG", "hepatotoxicity", "bioavailability", "mitochondria", "antioxidant"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Rethinking Art Education for Older Adults: An Ethnographic Study of the University of the Third Age\n", "id": "8542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3487", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Our older population is growing, and by the year 2030, one in every five Americans will be over the age of 65.

In this writing, I examine the types of programming that are currently available and I explore new possibilities through the British University of the Third Age (U3A).  The U3A is a learning organization where older adult members (50 and older) share their knowledge, expertise, experiences, and interests by learning from each other.

Simulations of both quasi-linear convective systems and supercells were performed in which the relative humidity in a midlevel dry layer was varied while preserving the buoyancy profile and CAPE.  The presence of dry air caused a reduction in overall storm intensity, as measured by updraft mass flux, total condensation and total rainfall; the reduction was more dramatic at lower values of CAPE.  In high-CAPE line-type simulations, the downdraft mass flux and cold pool strength were enhanced at the rear of the trailing stratiform region in a drier environment.  However, the downdraft and cold pool strengths were unchanged in the convective region, and were also unchanged or reduced in simulations of supercells and of line-type systems at lower CAPE.  \n\nThe effects of dry air aloft are interpreted in terms of the reduction in the rate of updraft entrainment when dry air is present, leading to decreased mass flux and a lower rate of condensate production.  Smaller hydrometeor mixing ratios then exert a negative influence on the latent cooling rates associated with phase changes in the downdraft formation regions.  This effect offsets the enhancement of rain evaporation that is expected to occur in a drier environment and thereby prevents the strengthening of downdrafts and low-level outflow.\n\nThe modeling results reported here are inconsistent with the widespread notion that dry air aloft is favorable for stronger downdrafts and greater low-level outflow intensity.  A review of the literature is presented in which it is shown that observational evidence does not unambiguously support the necessity of dry air aloft for strong downdrafts and outflow.  The relative importance of environmental humidity, temperature and stability are examined, and it is shown that some observational studies may have overemphasized the role of environmental humidity.

This work covers exploration and the methodology of detection of two such types of damages - galvanic corrosion and impact damages, at the earliest stages of development. \nWhen AA2024 aluminum alloy and CFRP are coupled together the structural strength of the aircraft is unparalleled, but this comes at a price, namely galvanic corrosion (GC). Previous experimental results have shown that when CFRP composite materials are joined with high strength aluminum alloys (AA7075-T6 or AA2024-T3), galvanic corrosion occurs at the material interfaces, and the aluminum is in great danger of corroding. \nComposite materials used in aircraft are often subjected to unexpected environmental impact loads at high speeds, such as bird strikes and hailstone impacts. The damages developed in such cases is primarily in the form of delamination and matrix cracking, known as barely visible impact damage (BVID), since they are not easily observable by the naked eye.

Variation in Trajectories of American Marital Quality", "id": "15137", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7755", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Perhaps no subject in the study of the American family has been the subject of more research than marital quality. Because marriage at once serves as the most intimate of all personal relationships and as the basis of the family, perhaps the most fundamental social unit, the health and strength of marriage in the United States is a matter of great concern to policymakers, scholars, and the general public. Recent advances in the scientific study of marriage and marital quality have allowed marital researchers to begin to examine marriage longitudinally, resulting in debate about how marital quality changes over time. This debate has centered largely on two theories. The first perspective, known as the U-shaped Curve, suggests that marital quality takes a curvilinear function as a marriage matures, with high initial marital quality followed by declines and a subsequent uptick at later marital durations. The second, termed Continual Decline, suggests that marital quality deteriorates continually at all marital durations.\n\nIn this dissertation, I examine the evidence for these two perspectives and suggest that a new conceptualization of the problem is needed: rather than seeking for the way marital quality changes over time, we should seek to examine the ways individuals experience marital change over the life course. To do this, I leverage data and methods that shed light on variation in longitudinal trajectories of marital quality from both the beginning and the end of marriage and for different groups.\n\nThis monograph begins by empirically examining the possibility that not all individuals experience similar longitudinal changes in marital quality. Results from latent class growth analyses reveal the heterogeneous paths married individuals travel along the marital life course. Confirming prior work on the topic, I find that a single trajectory inadequately represents the marital experiences of individuals in the NLSY79. I find two trajectories of marital happiness and communication and three trajectories of marital conflict. Covariates such as socioeconomic status, past relationship history, family background, work history, psychological functioning, and demographic characteristics are used to examine the extent to which these features distinguish pathways of marital change in marital quality.\n\nNext, this monograph looks for evidence of differences in marital quality across major axes of familial and social stratification, such as divorce status, cohabitation experience, and race-ethnicity. Previous work has often compared the overall or average level of marital quality between cohabitors and non-cohabitors, people whose marriages are headed for divorce and people whose marriages are stable for long periods of time, and members of varying race-ethnicities. The analyses employ multigroup latent growth curves to examine trajectories of marital quality by cohabitation experience, divorce status, and race-ethnicity. The multigroup growth curves make it possible to examine changes in marital quality over time in addition to measuring differences in levels of reported marital quality.\n\nThird, this monograph addresses a question that has never been examined in prior work: is there variation in trajectories of marital quality prior to divorce? Most work on trajectories of marital quality has begun at the beginning of the marriage and looked forward in time. However, with an event like divorce, it is also possible to begin at the end of the marriage and look backward in time. Results using latent class growth analyses suggest two distinct trajectories for marital happiness and communication and three for conflict. Covariates tapping socioeconomic status, past relationship history, family background, work history, psychological functioning, and demographic characteristics are used to examine the extent to which these characteristics distinguish pathways of change in marital quality prior to divorce.\n\nIn sum, this dissertation provides a better understanding of the pathways married couples travel along the road to marital bliss or blunder, shedding light on the social processes governing contemporary patterns of marital quality.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7688], "author_name_tesi": "James, Spencer Lyle", "last_name_ssi": "James", "middle_name_ssi": "Lyle", "first_name_ssi": "Spencer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Richard Amato", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "Alan Booth", "David R Johnson", "David Eggebeen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Richard Amato, Dissertation Advisor", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member", "David R Johnson, Committee Member", "David Eggebeen, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["marital quality", "divorce", "race", "cohabitation", "happiness", "communication", "conflict", "latent class growth analysis", "latent growth curve"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Potential Involvement of GPR119 Receptor in the Effects of Novel Fat Sensor OEA on Taste Preferences and Body Weight Regulation to High-Fat Diets", "id": "28745", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Taste preference is very important to food selection and eating habits, which are of relevance to the study of both obesity and reward. GPR119 is a receptor for Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a fatty-acid signaling molecule, present in the gut and brain of rodents and humans. GPR119 regulates insulin and incretin hormone secretion and the use of agonists of GPR119 have been proposed as therapeutic intervention for treating obesity and diabetes. The objective of this research was to investigate whether GPR119 is involved in OEA\u2019s short-term effects on modulating taste preferences and/or long-term effects of highly palatable diets to induce obesity. Accordingly, the study had two specific aims: 1) to investigate the taste preferences, and 2) feeding behavior of GPR119 knockout (GPR119-/-) mice compared to wild type C57BL/6 mice. Our first study used brief (10-s) and short (5-min) access tests to characterize taste responses in GPR119-/- and determine how OEA affects lipid and sweet preferences in GPR119-/-. Our second study examined the involvement of GPR119 receptor in response the high-caloric diets on caloric efficiency (CE =\u0394kcal/\u0394g), caloric intake and weight gain. In the brief and short access preference tests, separate groups of mice (GPR119-/- n = 8, wild type n = 8) were used and presented with Intralipid solution (0.625%, 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, or 20%) or sucrose solution (GPR119-/- n = 10, wild type n = 10) at different concentrations (0.1M, 0.3M, 0.6M, 0.9M, 1.2M, 1.5M). Lick responses were measured over one 10-second presentation 80 times during a 20 minute testing session. Lick responses were also measured 20 minutes after 2.5mg/kg, 5mg/kg or 10mg/kg OEA intraperitoneal injection. The short access tests were performed with 5-min free access to two sipper tubes containing water and Intralipid solution or sucrose solution. Four groups of mice were used to measure differences in taste preference of different Intralipid concentrations (GPR119-/- n = 10, wild type n = 10) and different sucrose concentrations (GPR119-/- n = 11, wild type n = 11). Intake was measured over a 5-minute access period where mice had a choice between two sipper tubes of water or Intralipid/ sucrose solution. In Aim 2, the feeding study was performed over 6 weeks, using either standard chow (18% protein, 3.3kcal/g, GPR119-/- n = 6, wild type n =6), or high-carbohydrate chow (56.7% carbohydrate, 4.41kcal/g, GPR119-/- n = 6, wild type n =5), or high-fat chow (34.9% fat, 5.24kcal/g, GPR119-/- n = 7, wild type n = 6). In the brief access tests, there was no difference between GPR119-/- and wild type mice for either sucrose or Intralipid, suggesting that the absence of GPR119 has no effect on taste sensation or preferences. In contrast, the results of the short access taste preference study showed GPR119-/- mice consumed less from the high concentration Intralipid solutions than wild type mice (5% Intralipid, -0.07mL, p<0.05; 10% Intralipid, -0.12mL, p < 0.001; 20% Intralipid, -0.09mL, p < 0.01), whereas we did not observe significant differences between strains for sucrose preferences. In the brief access tests, OEA reduced lick responses for both sucrose and Intralipid in dose-related manner in both the GPR119-/- and wild type mice. The GPR119-/- mice showed a reduced sensitivity to lower dose of OEA (5mg/kg) in reducing lick-responses for higher concentrations of sucrose compared to wild type mice. In the long-term dietary experiment, GPR119-/- mice gained less weight on high-fat chow during the 6-week feeding study (p < 0.01). The cumulative caloric intake of GPR119-/- mice on both high-fat and high-carbohydrate diets was lower than in wild type controls (normal, p < 0.01; high-carbohydrate, p < 0.001; high-fat, p < 0.001). The cumulative CE, a proxy measure for basal metabolic rates, suggested that GPR119-/- mice had a higher metabolic rate (lower caloric efficiency) on the high-fat diet (high-fat, p < 0.05), but not while consuming high-carbohydrate diet. The observation that GPR119-/- mice did not consume as much lipid as wild type at higher concentrations in the short access preference data supports our hypothesis that GPR119 receptor is involved in lipid sensing and the formation of taste preference. Furthermore, the results of the dietary study showing that on high-fat diet GPR119-/- mice initially gained less weight and had an overall lower caloric intake and CE than wild type mice, together with reduced short-term preferences for fat, support the hypothesis that one means by which GP119 may reduce body weight on highly palatable diets is to decrease fat intake through reduced oral preferences. Our finding is novel, and points to taste effects adding to the potential underlying mechanism by which the endogenous ligand, OEA and synthetic GPR119 agonists may curb appetite, in turn could be exploited as a therapeutic target for treating obesity. Future studies are warranted to explore the effects of GPR119 on oral and GI fat signaling in the context of cephalic and post-ingestive signals regulating metabolism and relevant to diabetes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11771], "author_name_tesi": "Jamis, Catherine ", "last_name_ssi": "Jamis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Catherine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andras Hajnal", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andras Hajnal, Thesis Advisor", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Kirsteen Nairn Browning, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fat sensing", "obesity", "dietary fat", "taste", "mouse models"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Silent Symphony: Unconventional Myosin 3a and Human Hereditary Hearing Loss", "id": "26343", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The perception of sound is a process that converts mechanical sound waves to nerve impulses and relies heavily on actin-based protrusions in inner ear hair cells called stereocilia. Unconventional class III myosins (MYO3A and MYO3B) have been found to play a role in the maintenance of stereocilia length, which is essential for hearing. A number of proteins have been implicated in stereocilia length maintenance and many are associated with non-syndromic hereditary hearing loss. ESPIN1 is an actin bundling protein that is transported by MYO3 to the barbed-end of the stereocilia where it plays a role in cross-linking and regulating actin filament length. Recessive loss-of-function mutations in MYO3A are the cause of the inherited hearing impairment phenotype DFNB30 (Walsh et al., 2002), possibly because of the failed MYO3A-dependent ESPIN1 transport to the stereocilia tips. A mouse model of DFNB30 results in age-dependent degeneration of the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells (Walsh, 2010). An uncharacterized missense mutation (G488E) in MYO3A was recently found to be associated with human deafness (Grati et al., unpublished). This mutation is located near the switch I loop, responsible for the steric availability of myosin\u2019s nucleotide-binding pocket. We proposed that the mutation may alter the motor ATPase cycle and motility, which were examined directly with biochemical studies. Another goal of the study was to characterize the point mutation in a cell culture model, which examines MYO3A and ESPIN1 in filopodia, actin-based protrusions with similar properties to stereocilia. We hypothesized that the mutation may prevent normal motility to the filopodial tips and proper elongation of the filopodia. \nMYO3A transport of ESPIN1 was tested by examining the localization of fluorescently tagged versions of MYO3A and actin bundling in COS7 cells. Since wild-type MYO3A accumulates at filopodia tips, this model provides a well-defined spatial compartment where potential interactions can be clearly visualized. Live imaging of COS7 cells transfected with WT GFP.MYO3A.\u0394K and ESPIN1 showed dynamic co-localization at the filopodia tips. In contrast, GFP.MYO3A.\u0394K.G488E co-expression with ESPIN1 showed a significant reduction in filopodial tip localization of both proteins. Steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity of baculovirus-expressed MYO3A. \u0394K.2IQ wildtype and mutant were performed with an NADH-coupled assay. The maximum ATPase rate of the mutant was shown to be significantly reduced as compared to the wildtype, suggesting that the mutation results in the loss of MYO3A\u2019s force-generating function. Motor activity of purified GFP-labeled MYO3A was directly examined using an in-vitro motility assay. Wild-type MYO3A was able to generate actin sliding while the mutant myosin is still is progress.\nThe cumulative results from these experiments suggest that the mutation located on switch I and near to the conserved nucleotide binding region, disrupts this structural element that is critical for motor function. The introduction of this mutation is sufficient to produce defects in MYO3A-based ESPIN1 translocation, filopodial length, and filopodia density. The findings in the filopodia of COS7 cells may hold true for stereocilia in which mutant MYO3A prevents normal motility to stereocilia tips, causing height defects and degeneration of the stereocilia in the inner ear hair cells.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11220], "author_name_tesi": "Jamis, Lina ", "last_name_ssi": "Jamis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Martin Yengo", "Alistair J Barber", "Sarah Bronson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Martin Yengo, Thesis Advisor", "Alistair J Barber, Thesis Advisor", "Sarah Bronson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["myosin", "MYO3A", "stereocilia", "Espin1", "filopodia", "actin", "switch I", "G488E"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A study Of Particle Size Sensitivity To Sulfation Of Indian Limestones", "id": "15624", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7971", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fluidized bed combustors (FBC) operating at both atmospheric and elevated pressures have received considerable attention from utilities worldwide because of their ability to capture SO2 in-situ during combustion and to minimize NOx production. Limestone attrition in the circulating fluidized bed combustor has been of significant interest primarily because of its influence on sorbent performance.\nIn the current study, five limestone samples from various parts of India that are currently being used in power plants were characterized for sulfur capture. These limestones were marked, Sorbent A, Sorbent B, Sorbent C, Sorbent D, and Sorbent E, for confidentiality reasons. They were characterized based on their porosity and pore size distribution, surface area, chemical composition analysis, petrographic characteristics, and SO2 capture performance in Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). A bench scale Circulating Transport Reactor (CTR) was used to determine the degree of attrition of the limestones while simultaneously sulfating the samples in a simulated flue gas environment. Particle size distribution was used to determine the attrition behavior.\nThe calcium carbonate content of these limestones varied between 70 and 95 wt. %. Three size fractions, -20 to +25 (-850\u03bcm to +710\u03bcm), -80 to +100 (-180\u03bcm to +150\u03bcm) and -200 to +270 (-70\u03bcm to +53\u03bcm) US mesh, were used to determine the sulfation behavior in a TGA. Some limestones were found to be more sensitive towards sulfation on reduction of particle size compared to others. For example, the -20 to +25 mesh sample of Sorbent C required 17.7 g of stone per g of sulfur captured whereas the -200 to +270 mesh sample required only 5.7 g of stone per g of sulfur captured. On the other hand, the -20 to +25 mesh sample of Sorbent D required 7.6 g of stone per g of sulfur captured while the -200 to +270 mesh sample required 6.3 g per g of sulfur captured. \nHot stage microscopy data clearly revealed that Sorbent D, the most particle size insensitive limestone, developed a network of Thermally Induced Fractures (TIFs) that provided easier access to internal surface area compared to the rest of the limestones that did not develop TIFs. BET surface area of the raw limestone did not correlate well with the stone requirement of the limestones studied. Regardless of the calcium carbonate content, limestones that developed TIFs were found to have higher calcium utilization efficiency and were also observed to be insensitive to the particle size during sulfation. Thus smaller particle size was not a requirement to maximize sulfur capture. These results for the limestones studied agreed well with the study performed by Penn State on twenty Pennsylvania limestones in 1994.\nWhile the development of TIFs explained the sulfation behavior of Sorbent D and Sorbent C as well as Sorbent B and Sorbent E, it did not agree with the results for Sorbent A. Based on the BET surface area data, it was concluded that Sorbent A was inherently less reactive than the rest of the limestones. The data also suggested that the high calcium utilization of Sorbent D limestone was due to the low inherent reactivity.\nThe Indian limestones were also studied for temperature sensitivity. The most and least particle size sensitive limestones were studied for their temperature sensitivity. Their sulfur utilization behavior was found to support the role of TIFs that led to lower diffusion resistance at temperatures as high as 950\uf0b0C thus allowing the reaction-kinetics to remain dominant.\nFor both the -20 to +25 mesh and -100 to +200 mesh samples, it was found that the Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI) had no correlation with the attrition of the limestone. Sorbent A with the second lowest HGI (harder) of 90 attrited more than Sorbent B with HGI 106 (softer) at fluidized bed temperatures (875\uf0b0 C). Sorbent B to Sorbent E with HGIs in the range 88 to 104 had similar levels of attrition. HGI of the limestones showed no correlation with the sorbent requirement for either of the three size fractions of the limestones in the Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). It was also found that there was no correlation between the sulfation capacity of the samples from cyclone in the CTR and HGI.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7919], "author_name_tesi": "Jammulamadaka, Hari Swarup", "last_name_ssi": "Jammulamadaka", "middle_name_ssi": "Swarup", "first_name_ssi": "Hari", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["limestones", "sulfation", "FBC", "CFBC", "particle size", "TIF"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Cattle-based Livelihoods and the Bear \"problem\" in Northern Ecuador", "id": "18768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8993", "abstract_tesi": "This project investigates cattle-based livelihoods in the northern Ecuadorian Andes in the context of increasing reports of Andean bear attacks on cattle since 2009.

Two months of interview-based research in 2012 grounded in the feminist theory of situated knowledges inform this thesis, which highlights the perspectives of people living and working in the region. Interviews with smallholding farmers and ranchers reveal a new reliance on cattle. The dairy economy organizes cattle-raising in the region, and brings rewards such as steady income, as well as new risks including the threat of bear attacks. Dairy also provides a viable livelihood for those remaining in the countryside following five decades of rural outmigration. These farmers and ranchers remain committed to living in the countryside for reasons related to preference and socioeconomic structure. This case study shows that the confluence of the challenges of making a living in rural spaces, the risks of raising cattle, the encroachment on bear habitat, and the frustration with government policies have created a context in which bears have become a \u201cproblem.\u201d It also suggests that the threat of bears is produced by a variety of decisions regarding livelihoods and illustrates how regional economic processes of migration and dairy production influence human-wildlife relations on the agricultural frontier.

The use of traditional fixturing techniques such as jaw chucks and vise while machining components in machining centers has many disadvantages such as clamping induced errors, reduced workability for tools and increased setup time. \nA novel approach to workholding and an alternative to the use of mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic mechanism is Light Activated Adhesive Gripper (LAAG) technology. LAAG utilizes photocurable acrylic adhesives as the main component of the system. The preferred adhesive for the technology is CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2. The patented technology utilizes a sapphire pin housed in a metallic casing to allow transmission of UV light to the adhesive which cures and adheres itself to the workpiece. The number of adhesive joints needed, size of sapphire pin and orientation of the pin can be designed using FEA software. The preferred light source is a metal halide UV spot curing lamp. The LAAG system was proven to exhibit high holding strength, maximum dynamic rigidity and increased workability for tool.\nAs a case study, the LAAG technology was applied to study its relative benefits and cost efficiency in comparison to conventional fixturing mechanism used by Precision Grinding and Machining (PGM), where a LAAG fixture was conceptualized and developed to hold an Aluminum bracket during its machining operation. The case study revealed that the use of LAAG workholding could significantly lower the total machining cycle time and cost associated, while maintaining good part quality. \n\tHowever the case study also raised a number of questions. Specifically the major issues were the existence of a large secondary cure zone, effect of leaving trimmed adhesive layer over the surface of gripper pins and workpiece coating. Previous research with Dymax 602 Rev A under smaller gap thickness showed no secondary curing effect. The effect of secondary cure zone on the adhesive joint strength and the factors influencing the formation of secondary cure zone are little known.\nIt is little known whether the practice of leaving trimmed adhesive layer on the gripper will affect the adhesive joint strength. Also it is not known whether the adhesive layer will attenuate the light reaching the uncured adhesive layer during re-bonding cycle. The effect of different trimming methods on adhesive joint strength and attenuation are also to be studied.\nAs the life of the UV spot cure lamp ages, the intensity of the light output decreases. An investigation to achieve the same adhesive strength as that obtained by a new lamp just by increasing the exposure time is also to be evaluated. \nA detailed analysis of bonding on to a painted surface with and without residual adhesive on it is also to be studied. More specifically, techniques to remove residual adhesive from the surface of workpiece effectively so that further operations on it such as painting etc is not affected by the underlying layer of residual adhesive.\nTo begin the investigation, the presence and contribution of secondary curing effect in CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 was evaluated. The results were compared with Dymax 602 Rev A. Secondary curing was previously observed with Dymax 602 Rev A, even with smaller joint thickness. However, the diameter was observed to be small, and it was never crazed. Consequently it was assumed to have negligible impact on adhesive joint strength. In the cases in which Dymax 602 was mixed with carbon black, a secondary cure zone never appeared.\nAn investigation where the strength proportional to gripper pin diameter and secondary cure diameter with CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 was also studied. This investigation revealed that secondary curing does contribute significantly to the final adhesive strength of the adhesive, however no proportionality effect was revealed. Statistical comparison was done to compare the means of CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 with Dymax 602 with 15mm chassis diameter and different diameter of gripper pins (0.132\u201d, 0.1875\u201d and 0.25\u201d) and it was proven that the means were statistically different. The experiments were carried out with 15mm chassis diameter with pin diameters (0.132\u201d,0.1875\u201d and 0.25\u201d) consistently produced much larger secondary cure zones and much higher average axial load strength for all three pin diameters.\nFurther investigation into the effect and contribution of secondary cured adhesive layer was executed by reducing the diameter of chassis to choke the formation of secondary cured adhesive layer. Reduced diameter steel chassis was taken, 6mm and 8mm and bonded with Aluminum anvils by using Dymax 602 and CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 and the comparison of strength was made. With 6mm chassis diameter the formation of secondary cured adhesive layer was greatly reduced and the mean strength observed with CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 and Dymax 602 was not statistically different. However, when the chassis diameter was increased to 8mm, sufficient area for formation of secondary cured adhesive layer was present. The mean strength observed with CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 was 1217 N as against to 623 N with Dymax 602. The means were statistically different.\nIt is evident that with enough room for formation of secondary cured adhesive layer, the strength of the adhesive bond increases suggesting that secondary cured adhesive contributes significantly to adhesive strength. The relationship between secondary cure zone diameter to the diameter of gripper pin used was studied. Varying diameters of gripper pin was taken such as 0.132\u201d, 0.1875\u201d and 0.25\u201d and the secondary cured adhesive layer diameter was measured in each case. However, no correlation was found between them. From this study, it was found that the secondary cure zone extends in diameter range from 7mm to 15mm. \nAn investigation to study whether the adhesive strength increases with increase in chassis diameter, a reduced chassis diameter experiment was done with CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2 as the test adhesive. Steel chassis with 0.132\u201d diameter gripper pin was taken with chassis diameters - 6mm, 8mm, 11mm, 12mm and 12.7mm. No trend of increase in strength with increase in chassis diameter was noticed. Secondary cured adhesive layer does contribute significantly to the strength of the final adhesive bond, however no trend was noticed. Chassis with 6mm diameter yielded an average strength that was substantially and statistically lower than the averages for 8mm, 11mm, 12mm and 12.7mm. Likewise, the chassis (8mm, 11mm, 12mm and 12.7mm) yielded average strength that were statistically equivalent. A 15mm chassis yielded an average strength that was significantly higher, which was attributed to the randomness due to inhomogeneous nature of the adhesive.\nThe next investigation was to study whether the type of chassis material determined adhesive strength. Steel and Aluminum chassis with different diameter of gripper pin was taken. Aluminum roughly has twice the reflectivity of steel in UVA and Blue spectrum. Since it is believed that secondary curing is driven by light bleeding into the secondary cure zone, it would seem logical that a chassis made of aluminum could reflect more curing light photons into the secondary cure zone than steel. Another way in which the use of aluminum could affect the light reaching the adhesive joint is its possible affect on the number of photons passing through the gripper pin. In theory the gripper pin surrounded by adhesive, acts as a perfect wave guide and does not leak light. However, in case it did, an aluminum chassis would have a greater capacity to reflect the light back into the gripper pin than a steel chassis.\n From the experiments, it was noticed that chassis made from aluminum yielded greater average joint strength than steel chassis for identical experimental conditions. However, the differences were moderate, and can not be proven statistically. Also the relationship between chassis material and secondary cure zone diameter was also not established.  Both material types produced the same range of secondary cure zone diameter under similar testing parameters.\nThe results of light transmission experiments indicate that light transmission through the aluminum chassis was slightly better than through the steel chassis for both the UVA spectrum and blue spectrum. There is evidence that the greater reflectivity provided by aluminum over steel does influence the overall strength of an adhesive joint formed from CTECH\u00ae 14-90-2. But the influence is not significant.\nThe next investigation was to study the combination of gripper pin diameter and light guide diameter that produces the maximum adhesive strength and also be economical in usage. The different gripper pin diameter 0.132\u201d, 0.1875\u201d and 0.25\u201d was used with both 3mm fiber core light guide and 5mm liquid core light guide and the strength was observed. It was found that under similar parameters, a 3mm fiber core light guide performs better with 0.132\u201d diameter gripper pin and the results were proven statistically. This was attributed to loss of light intensity in larger diameter (0.1875\u201d and 0.25\u201d) of gripper pins due to diffusion. A 5mm liquid core light guide yields better result with 0.25\u201d diameter gripper pin. The mean adhesive joint strength using 0.1875\u201d gripper pin was 1329N (at 50% lamp power) and 2296N (at 100% lamp power) as against to using a 0.25\u201d gripper pin which produced 2205N (at 50% lamp power) and 2904N (at 100% lamp power). The huge difference in mean strength at 50% lamp power was due to randomness in adhesive nature. However, the increase in strength by using a 0.25\u201d diameter gripper pin to a 0.1875\u201d diameter gripper pin also comes with increase in cost of operation.\nThe effect of residual adhesive on adhesive strength during re-bonding was studied. An appropriate trimming method for reducing the cured adhesive layer after de-bonding the workpiece from the fixture was analyzed. The different trimming methods used were facing, Facing & buffing and Milling. Different trimming processes were used to study whether the tool marks left by facing versus milling influenced the adhesive joint strength. Likewise, buffing the adhesive layers was done to smooth out the tool marks left during facing operation and thereby increase the translucence.  \nAll the trimming methods produced similar adhesive strength during re-bonding; milling was selected as the best method as the fixture need not be removed from the machining center and helps in reducing the cycle time involved. The UV light transmission through residual adhesive layer was also studied. It was found that the presence of residual adhesive layer on gripper pin reduces the available UV light intensity by about 68% when compared to gripper pin that are stripped clean. \nAnother investigation that was performed was to study the impact of leaving the cured adhesive layer on the gripper pin with no trimming or cleaning cycle. The variation of adhesive strength under re-bonding was studied. It was found that the adhesive strength varies randomly but the variation falls within the range of adhesive strength that one would notice with a clean chassis. The drawback to not trimming the adhesive is that the failure of the adhesive joint cannot be predicted. As the old adhesive layer is being exposed to extended UV light curing, the adhesive layer becomes brittle over time and fails suddenly. This was observed with sections of residual adhesive layer missing generally over the gripper pin on successive re-bonding cycles.\n\tAs the life of the curing lamp ages, the light intensity output reduces. An investigation was carried out to determine whether an increase in exposure time at lower irradiance would match the same strength as that achieved by using maximum irradiance was studied. Logically an adhesive joint that has been exposed for the longest period of time (80 seconds) and at maximum power level (100% lamp power) would have greater adhesive joint strength. It is critical to find ranges of exposure time and power level that will yield averages that are statistically the same or better than that achieved by using 80 seconds and 100% lamp power.\n\tThe standard parameter for bonding a sample was 0.02\u201d bond thickness, 40 second exposure time and 100% lamp power. In this study, the exposure time was increased to 60 seconds and 80 seconds and at different irradiance value (7.24 W/cm2 \u2013 50% lamp power, 9.71 W/cm2 \u2013 67% lamp power, 11.6 W/cm2 - 84% lamp power and 13.6 W/cm2 \u2013 100% lamp power), the strength was analyzed. A 3mm fiber core light guide was used and steel chassis with 0.132\u201d diameter gripper pin with aluminum anvil was used as test samples. At 60 seconds exposure time, the mean strength achieved at 50%, 67%, 84% and 100% lamp power were statistically not different. At 80 seconds exposure time, the mean strength at 50%, 67% and 100% were not statistically significant. This clearly indicates that by increasing the exposure time to 60 seconds and at reduced irradiance level, the mean strength can be matched with that of maximum irradiance under standard testing parameters. Even if the life of the bulb gets older, equivalent results can be achieved.\n\tThe results of the previous experiment were extended to verify at larger bond thickness. Samples were bonded at 0.1\u201d and by increasing the exposure time, it was found that the strength of the adhesive bonded at 50% lamp power with 60 seconds and 80 seconds exposure time matched the mean strength of adhesive bonded at 100% lamp power with 40 seconds curing time. Any exposure time greater than 40 seconds lead to this conclusion, except at 84% lamp power and 60 seconds exposure time, which is an aberration that was attributed to randomness in the adhesive nature.\n\tThe bonding of adhesive to painted surface and techniques to remove cured adhesive layer from the surface of the workpiece after bonding effectively were also studied. Samples were painted similar to the process by which the aluminum brackets were painted in industry. The adhesive strength was observed to have dropped significantly when bonded to painted samples in comparison to unpainted samples. It is to be noted that the paint was failing and not the adhesive. \n\tThe strength of adhesive when bonded to paint was 391 N as against to 1217 N when bonded to unpainted sample. The impact of cleaning the cured adhesive layer by using a hot air gun and studying the effect of residual adhesives on paint adhesion was also studied. Samples were cleaned using hot air gun and the sample surface was visibly clean from any adhesive remains. It was painted and subjected to axial load test. Aluminum anvils with turned/bead blasted surface and steel anvils with turned and bead blasted surface was taken and bonded with 8mm steel chassis diameter with 0.132\u201d diameter gripper pin. Steel anvils with bead blasted surface had the maximum effect from residual adhesive as it recorded 3 runs with 0N axial strength. The presence of residual adhesive weakens the bonding of paint to the substrate and the usage of hot air gun does not effective remove the adhesive. \n\tUltrasonic cleaner with hot coolant bath and adhesive remover technique was used to clean the residual adhesive before painting the sample. Statistical analysis was done to determine whether the means for the two treatments were different from each other and also to identify which was the best treatment for adhesive removal. It was found that the means were not statistically different. The two treatments provided similar results and the means were compared with anvils painted with no adhesive remains. It was found that both the treatments provided results similar to using a painted anvil with no adhesive remains which signifies that these methods effectively removed residual adhesive from the surface of workpiece. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5827], "author_name_tesi": "Janarthanam, Santhosh Kumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Janarthanam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Santhosh Kumar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Demeter", "Edward Demeter", "El Amine Lehtihet"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Demeter, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Demeter, Thesis Advisor", "El Amine Lehtihet, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["LAAG", "Advanced fixturing", "Photocurable adhesives", "Workholding"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Volcano-Tectonic Evolution of Flateyjarskagi, North Central Iceland", "id": "10627", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lithostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and K/Ar ages from Flateyjarskagi, north central Iceland, reflect tectonic reorganization of crustal accretion zone activity ~ 7 Ma.  Two flood basalt piles are in unconformable contact along this western flank of the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ).  The older ranges in age from ~ 9.5 to 13 Ma and is largely composed of tholeiite flows.  In eastern Dalsmynni the upper to middle portions of this older basaltic pile define a 15\u00b0-35\u00b0 SE dipping, monoclinal flexure developed ~ 6-7 Ma during early development of the present NVZ.  Lavas of a flood basalt group younger than about 6.5 Ma were deposited uncomformably on the older, flexured basalt pile.  These postflexure age flows mostly consist of compound doleritic basalts and olivine tholeiites; possible tillites are found in the upper portion of this sequence.  The unconformity between the older and younger basalt piles represents a major structural, temporal, and lithological boundary in north central Iceland.  Zeolite zones appear subhorizontal through the Dalsmynni flexure zone and have been largely reset, subsequent to flexuring, by westward onlap of the younger basalt sequence onto the older subsided and flexured flows.  Radiometric ages, regional isochron patterns and timing constraints for Tj\u00f6rnes Fracture Zone-related shear deformation indicate the model of a singular, ~ 130 km eastward jump of the axial rift zone in north Iceland, ~ 6-7 Ma, is too simple.  Crustal accretion older than 12 Ma along a \u201cproto-NVZ\u201d is apparently required, indicating that northern Iceland has had multiple-branched crustal accretion zones up until about 7 Ma, at which time a single spreading zone along the present NVZ developed.\n\nWe provide the first direct confirmation of large distributed rotational shear along an active transform within autochthonous oceanic crust, based on work along the Tj\u00f6rnes Fracture Zone (TFZ).  Over an 11-km broad region, dike and bedding composite trends show progressive northward clockwise curvature up to 110\u00b0, but a tectonic shear interpretation for this curvature has been controversial.  Paleomagnetic analyses of three lava sequences in the zone of pronounced structural curvature indicate large clockwise rotations about apparent vertical axes have occurred, 98\u00b0-113\u00b0 at two sites, and 149\u00b0-164\u00b0 at the most deformed site, depending on the chosen reference declination.  Comparisons of mesofracture orientations (n = 2041), from the southern and northern parts of the study area, are consistent with and permissive of the shear zone hypothesis.  Regionally distributed shear deformation has been reported from many continental transcurrent and transform settings, and from allochthonous oceanic crust in some ophiolites, but there are few submarine analogs.  Rotational normal faulting in north Flateyjarskagi has caused NW lava dips of 30\u00b0-45\u00b0.  Kinematic stereonet modeling suggests that the idealized, incremental combination of clockwise rotations about vertical axes, with normal fault rotations about horizontal axes, can lead to the apparent \u201cover rotation\u201d of the paleomagnetic declinations by ~ 40\u00b0-80\u00b0.  This potential issue is geometrically tied to the steep inclinations (e.g., 75\u00b0) of the paleomagnetic reference field directions associated with Iceland\u2019s latitude.  \n\nMuch of the tectonic literature on Iceland states that spreading in north Iceland has always occurred along a single rift zone that migrated or jumped to the east and that the NVZ developed ~ 7 Ma when activity ceased along the western Sn\u00e6fellsnes-Skagi Zone (SSZ).  However, this is not compatible with observations; multiple lines of evidence show that spreading about a proto-NVZ has occurred since ~ 13+ Ma.  Such proto-NVZ spreading may have started as early as ~ 26 Ma.  Both on-land and marine evidence suggest that prior to ~ 7 Ma, north Iceland experienced spreading along parallel (or dual) volcanic rift zones, as presently occurs in south Iceland along the Western Volcanic Zone and Eastern Volcanic Zone.  Robust conceptual models of crustal accretion in north central Iceland need to incorporate two unusual geologic characteristics that are spatially associated over a width of ~ 125 km:  (1) the regional presence of high obliquity angles in flows from ~ 7-11+ Ma, which imply offlap of volcanic production to the south over that time period; and (2) the inferred presence of submerged oceanic crust that may be as old as 37 Ma. \n \nFlateyjarskagi shear zone deformation started ~ 9.5 Ma, which apparently formed in conjunction with spreading along a forerunner of the NVZ.  Along the latitude of Flateyjarskagi, this proto-NVZ was apparently largely amagmatic from ~ 9.5 to 7 Ma, after which buildup of the major younger basalt pile in this area started.  In northern Flateyjarskagi, this amagmatic period apparently coincided with (1) large tectonic rotations about subvertical axes due to TFZ shearing, and (2) the imposition of the steep NW lava dips that are associated with large rotational normal faulting that reflects regional extensional strain of ~ 13% along a WNW-ESE direction.  The TFZ may be a very long-lived transform zone that started ~ 26 Ma, sharing characteristics with a highly oblique rift zone. \n \nA large area of approximately E-W trending lava isochrons in the Tertiary series of north central Iceland, in flows from > 11 Ma to ~ 7 Ma, has a N-S extent of ~ 150 km.  Such isochrons are subparallel to presumed plate flow lines; in other areas of Iceland, as along the crust flanking most submarine spreading ridges, isochrons are approximately perpendicular to plate flow lines. \n \nWe suggest that over much of north central Iceland, a broad E-W trending region between the SSZ and proto-NVZ underwent diffuse, non-zonal crustal accretion.  Lava isochrons and dips indicate that this broad region of volcanism retreated to the S over a time period from > 11 Ma to ~ 7 Ma.  The duration of the hiatuses flanking the NVZ generally decreases from north to south, and they apparently disappear given the existence of several very long, continuous stratigraphic sections which lack significant hiatuses.  This suggests that volcanic production along central Iceland has been quite continuous during the last 13 Ma, and that the NVZ hiatuses were developed by a combination of (1) southward retreat of the zonal volcanism along a proto-NVZ from ~ 9.5 to 6.5-7 Ma (after which renewed zonal volcanism along the re-established NVZ occurred as far north as Flateyjarskagi, resulting in the accumulation of the younger basalt pile), and (2) the age distribution of the flexured, older basalts that were buried by the renewed NVZ volcanism.  Volcanic rift zone activity at a given location along most of the NVZ has been relatively transient, while more southerly (\u201chotspot\u201d?) volcanism in central Iceland has persisted for at least 13 Ma. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4023], "author_name_tesi": "Jancin, Mark D.", "last_name_ssi": "Jancin", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Voight", "Barry Voight", "Terry Engelder", "Derek Elsworth", "Donald Myron Fisher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Voight, Dissertation Advisor", "Barry Voight, Committee Chair", "Terry Engelder, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iceland", "plate tectonics", "spreading history", "paleomagnetism", "Tjornes Fracture Zone", "volcanic stratigraphy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Inference with implicit likelihoods for infectious disease models", "id": "15261", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7608", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Probabilistic models for infectious diseases are important for understanding mechanisms underlying the spread of infection.

Furthermore, traditional inference may lead to poor parameter estimates and the fitted model may not capture important biological characteristics of the observed data.

The series of uprisings, the Occupy movements and demonstrations sprang up across North America, and the Arab World in the last couple of years. In Asia, there are three salient social movements launched by young generation in 2014, including the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong, the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan, and the Return Our CPF Protest in Singapore. Young generation finds alternatives to challenge traditional norms by disobeying governmental decisions to express the demand of social reform. These series of social movements can be identified as the wave of E-Democracy that social media not only broaden people\u2019s political space and produce participation in public affairs, but also bring innovative tactics to different forms of regimes. Compared to authoritarian regimes, the social movements in three quasi-democratic regimes of Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore have broader public space for citizens to engage in public affairs. However, the rooted culture of Confucian meritocracy and filial piety potentially makes these three Asian states depart from liberal democracy. This study applied social network analysis to Twitter and Facebook data to take centrality, subgroup, and hierarchy analyses as a whole to explore the pattern of civic network in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore.\n\nThe findings show that civic networks in Hong Kong and Taiwan have similar traits that there is a group of actors with high centrality and multiplex clusters with dense interconnection within networks. Relatively, only few actors in Singapore can play a bridging role that activists or protesters are a small group of like-minded citizens who are affiliated to homogenous clusters. Civic networks in Hong Kong and Taiwan are toward horizontal linkages across different bonding of citizens, while civic network in Singapore is more likely to be hierarchical structure that symbolizes power control and network cohesiveness. The hierarchical network is exclusive of diverse clusters and may be incapable of adapting to unexpected disruption or exogenous pressure. However, the analyses also indicate that three civic networks are still affiliated to relatively homogenous clusters instead of truly diverse clustering. As these three states are all identified as quasi-democratic regimes, governments potentially discourage citizens from any kind of opposition and people are more sensitive to social movement. This context may explain how rooted Chinese culture potentially makes three networks toward hierarchical structure at large, even though the result indicates that Singapore network is the most hierarchical one. \n\nIn addition, these quasi-democratic regimes may not fulfill students\u2019 capacities for civic commitments, but lead to significant gaps between curriculum and practice. As students were major populations involving in these social movements, current civic education needs to be reformed in the wave of E-Democracy. Compared to conventional civic education emphasizing more on voting, charity or volunteerism, criticism-oriented civic education is needed to encourage students to find the causes of social problems and to involve in social movements. A colorful array for raising effectiveness of civic education should be an important field to provide students practical civic experiences to scaffold the sense of critical thinking and inquiry.

Large and well-established bodies of research have documented empirical evidence for the importance of intelligence or cognitive ability on academic achievement. Research on non-cognitive skills, in comparison, remains sparse and nascent. The extant non-cognitive skills literature from economics, psychology, sociology, and the broad field of education have recently provided evidence for the salience of several non-cognitive skills, particularly grit, which is defined by Angela Duckworth and colleagues (2007) as perseverance and passion for long-term goals. However, findings on grit are mixed, with some studies highlighting a significant role of the perseverance component of grit but not the passion component. Moreover, the lack of empirical evidence from cross-national studies indicates that no universal theoretical explanation about grit and achievement can be inferred yet. \nTo fill this important void in the literature, this dissertation builds on and extends the recent research on grit within the larger non-cognitive skills literature and focuses on the perseverance component to introduce the concept of academic perseverance, which is more narrowly defined and domain-specific than grit. Thus, this dissertation provides some of the first cross-national evidence on the association between academic perseverance and academic achievement. Findings from regression analyses with fixed effects show that academic perseverance is positively and significantly associated with achievement across countries, net of between-country differences, as well as within all countries, above and beyond student demographics and between-school differences. \nThese cross-national findings give support to the grit theory and buttress recent findings from a meta-analytic study of grit research highlighting the salience of the perseverance component of grit on academic achievement outcomes. Although there is much room for future studies to further examine the association between the full construct of grit and academic achievement outcomes when internationally valid measurement tools become available, this dissertation makes important theoretical and empirical contributions to the non-cognitive skills literature across multiple academic disciplines and the field of comparative and international education, which in turn would help inform education policy around the world. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16653], "author_name_tesi": "Jang, Hyojung ", "last_name_ssi": "Jang", "first_name_ssi": "Hyojung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra", "Gerald K Letendre", "David P Baker", "Liang Zhang", "John David Mccarthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra, Dissertation Advisor", "Gerald K Letendre, Committee Chair", "David P Baker, Committee Member", "Liang Zhang, Committee Member", "John David Mccarthy, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["non-cognitive skills", "grit", "academic perseverance", "achievement", "cross-national comparisons", "PISA"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Dynamic Wrist Workloads on Risks of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome", "id": "5992", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2334", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effects on nerve conduction measures of forceful exertion and repetitive movement with awkward wrist posture were examined with fifteen participants over 3 hours duration of exposure. Wrist workload was measured by using force resistance sensor and electrogoniometer, while the nerve conduction measures were recorded with TECA TD-20 EMG machine on before the start of the task and every 20 minutes thereafter, where the subject performed repetitive flexion/extension movements accompanied by intermittent pinch force exertion.\nThe results indicated that initial peak latencies (time = 0) were similar across workload conditions, however exposure to wrist workload over three hours of task performance produced a noticeable difference. Peak latencies for low force-low repetition (LOF.LOR), high force-high repetition (HIF.LOR), and low force-high repetition (LOF.HIR) conditions increased, while little change was found for high force-high repetition (HIF.HIR) condition. Regression analysis indicated that peak latency approached a reference value diagnostic of clinical evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome with 67 minutes of task performance, and 67 percent of participants had temporary peak latency increases beyond reference value under low force-low repetition (LOF.LOR) condition. \nThus, the high force-high repetition condition (HIF.HIR) results might be contrary to what would be expected, because full range of motions was not attained as supported by highly significant correlation between peak latency change and the range of motion. Also, temperature gain derived from rapid repetitive movements and highly forceful exertions may counteract the prolongation of peak latency, and mask the developing effect of carpal tunnel syndrome.\nAs expected, skin temperature had a profound effect on nerve conduction measures. After correction for skin temperature, temperature-corrected peak latency over time produced similar results to the measured peak latency.\nCorrelation analyses between workload variables and peak latency indicated that maximum wrist flexion, maximum range of motion, and cumulative exposure time had highly significant relationships with peak latency over time. Among these relationships, especially, the most interesting correlation was presented between cumulative exposure time of wrist F/E angle > 30 degrees and sensory nerve peak latency (r=0.3715, p=0.005), where peak latency increased as the cumulative exposure time increased. Regression analysis indicated that if wrist deviation repetitively exceeded 30\u201ea for over 125 minutes, sensory median nerve impairment may approach diagnostic clinical evidence of CTS. Thus, this relationship may be the most important output of this study, since peak latency change can be explained by cumulative time factor as well as wrist angular deviation factor, and it can be easily measured with the time interval when wrist is deviated over a threshold angle. In fact, the cumulative time of F/E angle > 30 degrees may serve as the best measure for investigating the effects of dynamic wrist workloads on the nerve conduction, hence the prevalence of CTS.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2319], "author_name_tesi": "Jang, Hyunkook ", "last_name_ssi": "Jang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunkook", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra", "Andris Freivalds", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Milind Jagdish Kothari"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member", "Milind Jagdish Kothari, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wrist Workloads", "Nerve Conduction Studies", "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Surface chemistry of hydrous ferric oxide and hematite as based on their reactions with Fe(II) and U(VI)\n", "id": "6218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3173", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-01-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reactions of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) and hematite (\u00a5\u00e1-Fe2O3) were studied.  Both HFO and hematite are of environmental importance in immobilizing contaminants through sorption and subsequent reduction.  In anoxic environments, ferric (hydr)oxides with Fe(II) are important redox buffers.  The hypothesis of this thesis is that the surface of hematite (the most thermodynamically stable ferric oxide at ambient temperature and pressure) was energetically similar to the surface of HFO.\nThe reactions of interest are: 1) characterization of sub-mm hematite particles; 2) transformation of HFO in the presence of Fe(II), other metals, and various ligands; 3) sorption of U(VI) and Fe(II) onto HFO or hematite; 4) precipitation of schoepite; 5) reduction of U(VI) by Fe(II) in the presence of HFO or hematite plus natural organic matter (NOM);  and 6) transformation of HFO or hematite induced by reduction of U(VI) by Fe(II).\nThe experimental goals are: 1) synthesize sub-mm hematite by thermal hydrolysis, measure the solubility of Fe(III), and analyze solid phase(s) using Transmission 57Fe-M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy, 2) analyze the transformation products of HFO and hematite using Transmission 57Fe-M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy, 3) measure sorption and solubility of U(VI) in the presence of HFO or hematite using isotherm technique, and 4) measure the reduction of U(VI) by Fe(II) in the presence of HFO or hematite.\nHematite (0.1 mm) was synthesized by thermal hydrolysis of acidic FeCl3 at 100 oC (Chapter II).  The [Fe(III)]dissolved of the suspension was initially close to equilibrium with hematite at room temperature.  As pH increases above ~3, [Fe(III)]dissolved was in equilibrium with HFO.  However, M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy detected only hematite.  This finding indicates that the hydrated surface of hematite might be similar to HFO.\nThe objective of Chapter III was to determine the effects of divalent metals or of ligands on transformation of HFO into more thermodynamically stable ferric oxides.  Transformation of HFO to more stable phases can result in decreased surface area and lower redox potential.  In some experiments, HFO was precipitated in the presence of chloride salts of Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and/or Fe(II).  In other experiments, Fe(II) and Cl-, NO3-, or SO42- were added to pre-formed HFO.  Transmission 57Fe-M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy was used to monitor the phase changes.  At pH 6.5 and 65 \u00a1\u00c6C, HFO was transformed into hematite in the presence of Zn(II) or Mn(II).  Both metals were significantly adsorbed for these conditions, occupying about 1.2 sorption sites per nm2 of HFO surface.  Transformations were not observed at pH 6.5 in the presence of Cu(II), which was weakly adsorbed (0.06 sites per nm2).  No transformation occurred in the absence of the divalent metals.  At pH 6.5 and room temperature, HFO plus Fe(II) transformed into poorly crystalline goethite in the presence of chloride, into goethite and lepidocrocite in the presence of sulfate, and into goethite and magnetite in the presence of nitrate.  The reaction in the presence of nitrate was of particular interest, since the result leads to the inference that oxidation of Fe(II) led to the formation a fresh HFO that was more reactive than aged HFO.  At pH 8.5 and room temperature, HFO that was formed with 0.033 or 0.33 mM Zn(II) and then aged with Fe(II) was transformed into magnetite that was depleted in octahedral Fe, i.e. non-stoichiometric or possibly mixed metal spinel, (Fe3+)IV(MexFe2+1-xFe3+)VIO4.  HFO that was aged with Cu(II) and Fe(II) was transformed into goethite and into magnetite that was also depleted in octahedral Fe.  The transformations at pH 8.5 were completely inhibited by 3.3 mM Zn(II) and transformations were significantly decreased by 3.3 mM Cu(II).  These results have extended observations of the transformation of HFO to neutral pH ranges and to lower concentrations of metals than previously reported.\nIn Chapter IV, the incorporation of U(VI) into solid phases (sorption and/or precipitation) in the presence of HFO or hematite was measured versus time (up to 48 days) for pH 5.9, 6.8, and 7.8.  Experiments were run at room temperature, under ambient partial pressure of CO2 (10-3.5 atm), and with 0.01 M NaNO3.  U(VI)T  ranged from 0.1 \u00a5\u00ecM to 7 mM.  HFO or hematite concentration was 0.1 mM as Fe(III)T.  At 0.01 day, plots of log [U(VI)solid-associated] vs. log [U(VI)dissolved] were linear with slopes less than one for all 3 pH values.  A previously reported sorption model for U(VI) on HFO (based on sorption fronts) was modified to be consistent with the sorption isotherms that were reported in this chapter.  Sorption reactions for (UO2)2(OH)2+2, (UO2)3(OH)5+, and UO2+2 were required in order to match sorption isotherms at all three pH values.  The new model successfully modeled sorption on hematite after accounting for lower surface area and a slightly higher pHzpc.  On and after 3 days, several data points that were initially super-saturated approached equilibrium with schoepite, except the most super-saturated initial conditions resulted in a more soluble UO3(s) precipitate.  There are significant differences in reported thermodynamic constants for the formation of hydrolysis species of U(VI); the solubility data was used to justify selection and use of thermodynamic constants that were reported by Langmuir.\nIn Chapter V, the abiotic reduction of U(VI) by Fe(II) was measured versus time in the presence of HFO or hematite, plus natural organic matter (NOM) in some experiments.  Solid products were identified with M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy.  Although U(VI) reduction by Fe(II) is spontaneous, it has been reported that the abiotic reaction does not occur in the absence of ferric (hydr)oxides.  About 80% of initial U(VI) was reduced by Fe(II) in the presence of hematite or HFO for low U(VI) concentrations such that sorption sites of the ferric oxides were sparsely occupied.  The initial rate of reduction was slower in the presence of HFO compared to hematite, but reduction after three days was independent of the ferric oxide phase despite thermodynamic predictions that final U(VI) should have been three orders of magnitude lower in the presence of hematite compared to HFO.  This indicated that the thermodynamic characteristics of hydrated hematite and HFO were similar, consistent with similar energy of sorption for the ferric oxides.  The final condition indicated that the solubility of ferric (hydr)oxide consistent with goethite, for both HFO and hematite.  NOM slowed the rate of reduction of U(VI) and decreased the eventual extent of reduction of U(VI) by HFO.  Goethite was the major ferric (hydr)oxide phase identified by M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy for experiments that started with HFO or hematite (1.8% 57-Fe) and Fe(II) (50% 57-Fe).  Magnetite was also present.  M&ouml;ssbauer spectroscopy indicated that both hematite and HFO were partially converted to goethite, i.e. more goethite was present than could have been formed due to oxidation of Fe(II) that is stoichiometric with U(VI) reduction.  Reduction did not occur when a higher concentration of U(VI) was used, that resulted in greater saturation of sorption sites, in spite of the larger thermodynamic driving force for reduction of U(VI).\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3160], "author_name_tesi": "Jang, Je-Hun ", "last_name_ssi": "Jang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Je-Hun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "William D Burgos", "Gary Lee Catchen", "David Lawrence Allara", "Paul J Tikalsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Committee Chair", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Gary Lee Catchen, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Paul J Tikalsky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reduction", "sorption", "surface chemistry", "hematite", "hydrous ferric oxide", "transformation of iron oxides", "Mossbauer spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Teens In Social Media: Data-driven Comparative Analysis On Behaviors In Instagram", "id": "28906", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12645", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social media plays an important role in connecting people and making them interact with each other.

However, these materials inherently lack a direct band gap and their crystal symmetry limits second-order optical nonlinearity.  In order to make next-generation system-on-a-chip devices, other materials must be incorporated into the system to integrate these properties into the system.  To minimize propagating wave perturbations in the pre-existing system, these materials should be made as small as possible, fundamentally limiting light-matter interaction.  However, new classes of two-dimensional materials that have been recently been discovered possessing both excellent optical properties, such as extraordinary nonlinear susceptibility, and an atomic thickness, making them excellent candidate materials to integrate into optical systems lacking these properties.\nThis dissertation covers work done to characterize and engineer the optical properties in two-dimensional (2D) materials in an effort to integrate them in optical systems.  First, a brief introduction is provided in Chapter 1.  Chapter 2 discusses the extraordinary second harmonic generation (SHG) in mono- and few-layered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs).  It is discovered that monolayer TMDs have susceptibilities over three orders of magnitude larger than typical nonlinear crystals.  This work is expanded in Chapter 3, where by synthesizing alloy TMD monolayers, we can tune the monolayer nonlinear susceptibility, allowing further opportunities for engineering 2D materials for optical applications.  \nChapter 4 covers a method to enhance the light-matter interaction in 2D materials by utilizing a simple nanocavity substrate.  Using this simple MoS2/Al2O3/Al substrate, we can optimize the monolayer absorption and emission by tuning the oxide thickness layer, increasing the exclusive MoS2 absorption.  In order to further increase this light-matter interaction with 2D materials, monolayers must be integrated into higher Q cavities.  To demonstrate stronger light-matter enhancement capabilities of ultra-high-Q microresonators, Chapter 5 describes a method to enhance the particle detection capabilities of microresonators using Raman spectroscopy, demonstrating particle detection and characterization capabilities that could become an excellent platform to further increase the light-matter interaction with 2D materials.

The major questions explored in this study were whether faculty and community partnerships have identities similar to organizational identities, and if so, what are their key characteristics? This study also explored what factors are associated with Partnership Identity development. The research questions were: (1) how faculty and community partners perceived the organizational identities of their employing institutions; (2) how faculty and community partners perceived their social identities within the context of the partnership; (3) the relationship between faculty and community partners\u2019 social identities and how they communicated/negotiated with one another. \n\tThe unit of analysis in this study is a partnership between faculty and community partners. Three partnerships were selected from a private liberal arts college and two partnerships were selected from a public land-grant university.

Data collection included multiple interviews with 19 faculty and community partners, observations of partnership meetings, interviews with relevant administrators at partners\u2019 employing organizations, and analysis of partnership-related documents. Participants were interviewed to understand how they viewed their employing organizations and themselves with regards to their work with the partnership, how they communicated with partners, and how they viewed aspects of the partnership.

Partnership Identity may be important for the successful functioning and longevity of faculty-community partnerships because how partners make sense of who they are together may influence their behaviors, commitments, and plans to maintain the partnership.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1899], "author_name_tesi": "Janke, Emily M.", "last_name_ssi": "Janke", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol L Colbeck, Ph D", "Lisa R Lattuca, Ph D", "Jeremy Cohen", "Dennis Arnold Gioia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol L Colbeck, Ph D, Committee Chair", "Lisa R Lattuca, Ph D, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Cohen, Committee Member", "Dennis Arnold Gioia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["partnership identity", "organizational identity", "public scholarship", "campus-community partnerships"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effects of Added Weight and Girth on Static Strength", "id": "14061", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7306", "abstract_tesi": "The rise of obesity is a challenge our world is facing today.  In the workplace the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has outlined guidelines for the recommended weight a person should not exceed when lifting an item repeatedly throughout the work day (United States, 1994).  One of the limitations of the 1991 lifting guidelines is that it does not account for a different body structure, such as obesity (Blosser, 2007). The purpose of this research is to compare the lifting capacities of the normal, overweight, and obese weight groups as well as determine if it is the added weight, added girth, or the added weight and girth that contributes to the change in lifting capacity.\n\nDuring the experiment the lifting capacity, using the leg and then torso muscles, of the participants was measured.  Next, the participants completed the maximum acceptable weight of lifts (MAWL), which determined the maximum amount they would be comfortable lifting every 15 seconds during an eight hour work day.  Phase 2 of the experiment was completed by the normal weight category participants.  They were asked to perform the lifts again but with a 19.7 pound weight vest on, a pregnant belly, and then with both on.  The weight vest simulated added weight and the pregnant belly simulated added girth. These procedures follow the protocol developed by Lorna Cintron (2012).\n\nThe results of the experiment showed that in Phase 1, gender, height, and weight were used to predict the lifting capacity using the leg and torso muscles. The regression model for the leg muscles had an R-squared value of 49.5% and the torso muscles had an R-squared value of 57.1%. The MAWL model produced an R-squared value of 37.7%, using the gender and leg average, which is worse than the previous models due to the subjective nature of the test. Phase 2 found that the added weight and girth were not significant factors in the regression model for the leg average, which produced an R-squared value of 54.1%. In contrast, the regression model for the torso average found that the added weight, girth, gender, and height were significant with an R-squared value of 60.7%. It was then determined that the extra weight on the back impacted the individual\u2019s ability to lift with their torso muscles. This research and two other studies have looked at the impact of obesity on lifting capabilities, but more research needs to be completed to prevent individuals in the workplace from developing lower back pain or injuring themselves on the job or outside of work.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7282], "author_name_tesi": "Jankiewicz, Susan Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Jankiewicz", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity", "lifting"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Crisis Resource Management Training:  Impact on Team Process and Team Effectiveness\n", "id": "10506", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6280", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Team process is vital to patient safety and patient care quality (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 2000).  During a patient crisis, team process is unique due to the dynamic nature of the unstable patient, need for rapid decisions, and team member coordination among providers who may be unfamiliar with one another. The purpose of this experimental, statistically-powered study was to evaluate the effects of Crisis Resource Management (CRM) training on the team process variables of teamworking, task management, situation awareness, and inter-professional attitude on the team effectiveness variables of team error rate and team response time among 24 interdisciplinary teams of two student nurses and two medical students.  The team effectiveness conceptual framework described by Kozlowski and Ilgen (2006) served as the theoretical framework.  The experimental group demonstrated a significant improvement in team process variables compared to the control group.  CRM training predicted 13% of the variance in task management (p = 0.05), 15% of the variance in teamworking (p = 0.04) and 18% of the variance in situation awareness (p = 0.03).  CRM training and task management predicted 22% of the variance (p = 0.04) in team error rate; CRM training and teamworking predicted 35% of the variance (p = 0.01) while CRM and situation awareness predicted 20% of the variance (p = 0.04) in response time to chest compressions.  Both control and experimental groups demonstrated a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in each variable of team process and team effectiveness from pretest to posttest demonstrating a definitive practice effect of interdisciplinary training.

Despite the growing interest, there is a dearth in research on customer value as a construct and its role in organizational buying. The purpose of this research was to expand our understanding of what organizational customers value in a product or service and why they value what they do while making buying decisions. \nThe basic premise of the marketing concept is that a product (or a service) is a bundle of physical and perceived attributes, which provides a customer with a bundle of physical and perceived benefits to satisfy his/her needs and goals.  This is also a central tenet of the means-end theory (Peter & Olson, 1993) which implies that what attributes a customer values (considers important) in a product is connected to those benefits derived from it that facilitate achieving his/her end goals as perceived by the customer.  Because of its ability to provide a deeper understanding of the customer decision making process, this study used the interviewing and data analysis technique called laddering based on the means-end theory (Reynolds and Gutman, 1988). Total 60 customers of a piece of telecommunication equipment code named prontom were interviewed in 40 organizations from the names provided by a prontom manufacturer code named Skycorp. The interview data were coded in specific categories of attributes (A), benefits (B), and end goals (E) as explained by Reynolds and Gutman (1988) to create an implication matrix.  Such a matrix shows the number of links among A, B, and E, which Woodruff and Gardial (1996) called customers\u2019 value dimensions underlying prontom buying decisions. A framework of customer value in organizational buying was proposed based on the analysis and classification of the value dimensions, means-end theory, and marketing literature. In addition, A, B, E derived were further analyzed for different segments using proportions and cluster analysis. \nThis research is a step toward bringing out some of the sources and contents of customer value in organizational buying and toward developing a testable framework of value to help business marketing practitioners and researchers better understand the organizational buying process.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5470], "author_name_tesi": "Jantrania, Swati ", "last_name_ssi": "Jantrania", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Swati", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William L Harkness", "Margaret J.

Most other soil orders presented mineral deficiencies and imbalances that restricted plant growth. These reductions occurred together with dilution or accumulation of minerals and carbohydrates in the leaf under elevated CO2. In order to understand how much vegetated land in Earth may suffer from edaphic limitations and be affected concurrently by climate change, we developed a new map of available phosphorus at a global scale. The map was the result of assigning soil units with characteristic available phosphorus values calculated with data obtained from global and regional soil surveys. To create the map, we employed more than 5400 records on Olsen and Bray available phosphorus. Our map confirms the pervasive nature of P limitation, and indicates that about 50% of low P agricultural land may experience significant increases in temperature at the end of the century, with most of these areas located in the tropics. Finally, looking at the mechanisms that plants exhibit to adapt to soil-related (edaphic) stresses, we studied the effects of root metabolic costs on soil exploration in maize. Plants that reduced their living root tissue volume either by producing thinner roots or by the formation of aerenchyma, were able to increase their root system which was associated with increased tolerance to water stress. Interestingly, our results indicate a root type-specific increase in the length of seminal roots associated with less metabolic burden and reduced water stress.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5134], "author_name_tesi": "Jaramillo-Velastegui, Raul Ernesto", "last_name_ssi": "Jaramillo-Velastegui", "middle_name_ssi": "Ernesto", "first_name_ssi": "Raul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Douglas Alan Miller", "Douglas Brian Beegle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member", "Douglas Brian Beegle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Olsen P", "available phosphorus", "nutrient dilution", "nutrient accumulation", "soil orders", "Festuca arundinacea", "elevated CO2", "root formation", "drought", "aerenchyma", "Metabolic costs", "Bray P", "climate change", "land cover land use", "LULC", "critical value"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TEACHER-LEARNER RELATIONSHIPS IN MEDICAL EDUCATION: A MIXED METHODS STUDY OF THE THIRD-YEAR EXPERIENCE \n\n", "id": "11697", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This purpose of this study was to examine third-year medical students\u2019 perceptions of their teacher-learner relationships in the clinical environment; and to explore how these relationships impact students\u2019 perceptions of teaching, learning, and their future roles as educators. To address this purpose, a sequential exploratory mixed methods research design was employed. This involved interviewing 13 second-semester, third-year medical students. Based upon the findings of these interviews, a survey was developed and distributed to the third-year Class of 2011 at a single medical institution. Seventy-two students participated in this survey. Findings suggest that students view the quality and importance of their relationships with clinical educators rather highly, and, in general, these relationships serve to empower students and are characterized by mutual engagement. Furthermore, students suggested that educators are often empathetic to their learning needs as well as their positionality; however, they did not believe that educators remember what it was like to be third-year students. Additionally, although evaluations impacted their abilities to be themselves around educators, they felt they could be authentic in their relationships over time. Students also noted that relationships were shaped by contextual factors, such as time, the clinical hierarchy, and the particular specialty through which they were rotating. It was also determined that teacher-learner relationships have shaped students\u2019 perceptions about teaching and learning in the clinical environment, in that students perceive both teaching and learning as being positively correlated with relationships. Finally, findings suggest that students\u2019 experiences in their teacher-learner relationships are a key factor in determining their specialty choice and how they hope to teach when they become educators.

Although a numerical method such as the multi-zone model has the potential to calculate airflow characteristics across building components, the accuracy of a calculation derived in this way depends on the quality of the model input The present study extends the experiments in ASHRAE RP1596 to develop a quick and accurate calibrated multi-zone ventilation model to enable further investigations into the ventilation performance of retail stores including the mechanical airflow rate and unintentional airflow. Specifically, this study (1) investigates air infiltration across frequently used automatic doors and (2) establishes significant parameters that quickly improve the accuracy of the simulation model. For the infiltration study, an airflow element was modified based on hourly door traffic passage through automatic entrance doors to predict physical conditions including differential pressure and direction across frequently used automatic entrance doors. The calibration of transient differential pressure across automatic entrance doors was achieved using a multi-zone model to calculate the transient airflow rate across the doors. In terms of establishing significant parameters for the ventilation model, the study developed a calibration procedure based on a number of measured data used in the model setting starting from the least effort to the greatest effort. The simulation result of the SF6 concentration decay at each calibration step was then calibrated with the field-measured data. \nFor the modified airflow element in the leakage area model, the frequency fluctuation of the differential pressure across the automatic entrance doors agreed well with that reported in the field-measured data. It was found that the automatic entrance doors constituted the main path of the unintentional airflow, which comprised 76\u201392% of the infiltration throughout the entire building. The greatest improvement in terms of model accuracy with the time-effective method was effected by more accurately measuring the outdoor air fraction measured from the rooftop units. The model uncertainties were improved by 42\u2013119% over the uncertainties of the base case model, and the estimated total effort for this task was 3\u201315 hours depending on the number of rooftop units subjected to monitoring. Then the corrected airflow characteristics across the automatic entrance doors further improved the model accuracy by 29\u201356% but only in the building with infiltration at the automatic doors. The proposed calibration procedure including the recommended significant input parameters can reduce uncertainties in the simulation models. However, it is also necessary to improve on previous models by using high accurate sensors and measurement techniques to in turn obtain more accurate measurements of the outdoor air fraction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9429], "author_name_tesi": "Jareemit, Daranee ", "last_name_ssi": "Jareemit", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Daranee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric", "Stephen James Treado", "William P Bahnfleth", "Ute Poerschke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Chair", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Member", "Ute Poerschke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Calibration", "Multi-zone model", "Ventilation", "Retail", "Automatic entrance door", "Tracer gas"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Development of Educational Simulations for Construction Engineering Education\n", "id": "8635", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5827", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "4D CAD models are increasingly being used in the construction industry for\ndetailed schedule reviews.

Data centers are becoming more prevalent with the increase in storage capacity, the cost reduction in high powered hardware, and the concrete web paradigm that these systems offer. The generic three-tiered approach of most data centers grants sufficient abstraction between the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data persistence layer, and provides web applications with an assortment of services. Most traditional data centers rely on HTTP protocol utilizing XML and HTML requests and responses as well as technology built around Java. Because of the increase in overhead (both from generic web protocol and Java serialization), data centers are having difficulty employing large data retrieval services for high performance analysis tools. It is well known that the greatest latency of these systems is due to network latency from the client workstations to the first tier of the data center. To alleviate this latency, some applications turn to services that empower low level communication such as TCP/IP and RMI. \nOur research tries to reduce the latency of such data intensive services through basic HTTP protocols and Java solutions. By adhering to standard web approaches, such common issues as network and firewall configurations, as well as data format inconsistencies, can be avoided. This research provides an effective solution to high volume data request latency problems and provides a generic methodology that reduces implementation overhead in the business logic layer of data centers.

Several mechanisms have been proposed; however, the exact mechanism has not been defined.  Blood volume distribution to high capacitance areas (i.e., the splanchnic region) influence orthostatic tolerance.  Limited data suggests that the distribution of blood volume during an orthostatic stress differs between women and men, where the women tend to pool more blood in the lower abdomen/pelvic region.  Accordingly, this series of experiments was designed to examine blood pressure regulation differences between the sexes as it relates to the contribution of the splanchnic circulation.  \n\nIn the first study, we sought to clarify whether or not a sex difference existed in tilt table tolerance.  We hypothesized that during head-up tilt (HUT) women would demonstrate less splanchnic vasoconstriction, leading to splanchnic pooling, lower blood pressure, and lower orthostatic tolerance.  Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (Qc, C2H2 rebreathing), stroke volume, splanchnic blood flow (SpBF, indocyanine green clearance), and vascular conductance (systemic, SVC=Qc/MAP; splanchnic, SpVC=SpBF/MAP; non-splanchnic, non-SpVC=SVC-SpVC) were measured during supine baseline, 70\u00b0 HUT, and recovery in 14 healthy women (23\u00b16 yrs; mean\u00b1SD) and 16 men (23\u00b15 yrs).  Neither median tilt time (15.7 vs. 21.8 min; \u00f72=0.54, p=0.46), nor the proportion surviving 45 min of HUT (\u00f72=2.92, p=0.09) was different between the sexes.

SpBF and SpVC were lower in women at rest but not during tilt (SpBF, supine: 1174\u00b1243 vs. 1670\u00b1391 ml/min, p<0.01; SpVC, supine: 14.83\u00b13.61 vs. 19.59\u00b14.95 ml\u2022min-1\u2022mmHg-1, p<0.01; SpBF, tilt: 884\u00b1300 vs. 1094\u00b1271 ml/min; SpVC, tilt: 13.14\u00b14.28 vs. 14.82\u00b14.16 ml\u2022min-1\u2022mmHg-1).  However, in the women SpVC was not reduced between baseline and tilt (&#8710;SpVC: -1.70\u00b13.19 ml\u2022min-1\u2022mmHg-1, p=NS; -4.81\u00b13.44 ml\u2022min-1\u2022mmHg-1, p<0.01), suggesting a blunted vasoconstrictor response.  Thus, women tended to have lower tilt-table tolerance associated with a smaller splanchnic vasoconstrictor reserve than men. \n\nIn the second study, splanchnic hemodynamics and tilt table tolerance were assessed after an infusion of placebo or octreotide acetate, a somatostatin analog whose vascular effects are largely confined to the splanchnic circulation.  We hypothesized that reductions in splanchnic blood flow (SpBF) and splanchnic vascular conductance (SpVC) would be related to improvements in tilt time.  Hemodynamic variables were collected in 14 women and 16 men during baseline, 70\u00b0 head-up tilt (HUT), and recovery during placebo and octreotide conditions.  HUT elicited an increase in heart rate and decreases in mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, stroke index, and systemic vascular conductance (SVC).  Additionally, SpVC and non-SpVC were lower during HUT.  Octreotide reduced SpBF and SpVC and increased SVC and non-SpVC.  A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare changes from baseline with respect to sex and condition.  Changes in SpBF and SpVC between supine and HUT were smaller in women (p<0.05).  There was a significant improvement in tilt table tolerance in both sexes with octreotide administration.  Median tilt times were increased from 15.7 and 21.8 min to 37.0 and 45.0 min for women and men, respectively.  A significant relationship existed between &#8710;SpBF (placebo-octreotide) and &#8710;tilt time in women (&#8710;tilt time=2.5-0.0083 &#8710;SpBF, p=0.0051) but not men (&#8710;tilt time=3.41\u20130.0008 &#8710;SpBF, p=0.59).  Thus, administration of octreotide acetate improved tilt table tolerance where the principal mechanism was by decreasing splanchnic vascular conductance.\n\nThe purpose of the third study was to quantify blood volume redistribution during graded tilt.  Head-up tilt (HUT) redistributes ~700 mL of blood to the dependent regions.  In a gravitational field, hydrostatic pressure is balanced against vascular compliance, resulting in a hydrostatic indifferent point (HIP).  Its location is independent of posture and should be coincident with a volume indifferent point (VIP).  Cardiac filling is determined by the hydrostatic gradient between the HIP/VIP and right atrium.  A more inferior VIP would lead to decreased preload and possibly orthostatic intolerance.  We located the VIP by employing segmental impedance to examine blood volume redistribution during HUT.  During HUT impedance increased above and decreased below the VIP, respectively, due to blood volume shifts.  An exponential model related blood volume shifts and the hydrostatic gradient to determine the location of the VIP, which was located at 64.5\u00b12.6% of an individual\u2019s height.  This method may provide a quantitative framework to assess the effects of blood volume distribution on tilt tolerance.\n\nThe fourth and fifth studies examined the impact of splanchnic blood volume manipulation on the location of the VIP.  We previously indentified that the splanchnic circulation contributes to the location of the VIP.  Using segmental impedance we identified the VIP under control conditions and when blood volume within the splanchnic segment was altered.  We also sought to determine the relationship between the location of the VIP and an individual\u2019s tolerance to an orthostatic stress.  In Protocol 1, we found that administration of the somatostatin analog, octreotide acetate, a selective splanchnic vasoconstrictor, induced a superior shift in the location of the VIP (+1.9\u00b13.3 cm, p=0.03).  This finding substantiated previous reports of improvements in tilt tolerance after octreotide and suggests it might be related to relocation of the VIP.  Conversely, in Protocol 2, exposure to lower body negative pressure (LBNP) induced splanchnic pooling and moved the VIP inferiorly (-6.0\u00b17.2 cm, p<0.01).  LBNP combined with head-up tilt significantly decreased tilt table tolerance (median tilt times: 28.0 min vs. 4.2 min; \u00f72=14.29, p<0.01); a positive relationship between \u00c4VIP and \u00c4tilt time existed (\u00c4tilt time = 3.05 + 0.12 \u00c4VIP, p=0.03).  Thus, individuals that demonstrated the largest inferior shift in the location of the VIP also demonstrated the largest decrease in tilt table tolerance.  We conclude that the splanchnic circulation plays an important role in determining the location of the VIP and its location is a determinant of tolerance to an orthostatic stress.  \n\nThe results of these studies indicate that women and men regulate blood pressure differently in the upright posture.  Specifically, women showed a decreased vasoconstrictor response that could be isolated to the splanchnic circulation.  Administration of octreotide, a selective splanchnic vasoconstrictor, improved blood pressure regulation during head-up tilt.  The mechanism by which this occured was related to alteration of the volume indifferent point to a more superior location.  Conversely, decrements in tilt table tolerance were shown to be directly related to an inferior shift in the location of the volume indifferent point.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5777], "author_name_tesi": "Jarvis, Sara ", "last_name_ssi": "Jarvis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Anthony Pawelczyk", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Cynthia J Bartok", "Mosuk Chow", "David Nathan Proctor", "Nancy Williams"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Anthony Pawelczyk, Dissertation Advisor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Chair", "Cynthia J Bartok, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member", "Nancy Williams, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["blood pressure regulation", "splanchnic blood flow", "bioelectrical impedance", "orthostatic intolerance", "somatostatin analog", "lower body negative pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Sequential Effects in Reaching Around Obstacles", "id": "6500", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5479", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many models of human reaching propose that movements are planned by minimizing\nmovement costs. A common assumption of these models is that movements are planned\nanew each time one is desired. In this thesis I will suggest that movement planning instead relies on the reuse and modification of previous movement plans. One prediction that follows from this proposal is that the ability to minimize movement costs may be limited by the perceptual- motor system\u2019s ability to modify the reused plan. The results from five experiments in which participants performed reaching movements in the presence of or in the absence of an intervening obstacle support this prediction. When both movement types were required within a block, direct movements were more curved when preceded by obstacle\u2013avoiding movements than by other direct movements. Thus, the cost of performing a direct movement was not fully minimized when its path differed\nsignificantly from the previous trial\u2019s path. In addition, obstacle-avoiding movements\nwere less curved when preceded by direct movements than by other obstacle-avoiding\nmovements. This second finding provides additional evidence for the reuse of previous\nmovement plans.

Cutting tool selection is a decision making stage in process planning that provides input to CAM for CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) code generation. Most of the state-of-art CAM systems still require a human process planning engineer to manually look after catalogues and manuals for selecting appropriate tools for machining a pocket geometry. This consumes a significant amount of time in process planning and hence, cutting tool selection can be considered a bottleneck stage. Also, in order to machine pockets, a process planner has to select more than two tools for optimizing the cutting time and to reduce the tool wear. We consider multiple cutting tool selection problem in this thesis. Since the cutting time is dependent upon several factors like step-over (radial depth of cut), step-down (axial depth of cut), tool geometry, feature geometry, feed rate, cost, etc, multiple cutting tool selection becomes highly constrained and large scaled problem. Using one small tool to machine a feature can eliminate un-machined and gouged areas inside the feature geometry. However, the material removal rate for a small tool is very low and hence consumes a lot of time and incur high production costs. Large tools are known to have higher machine removal rates despite maintaining un-machined areas. Hence, a trade-off or optimization solution is necessary between large and small tools from tools database in order to optimize the fitness function (cost or time taken to manufacture) while machining 2.5-D pocket geometries. In this thesis, feasible tools from the tools library are determined by generating accessible areas of the pocket feature geometries which are inputs from a process planning system. A new approach to open pocket accessible area generation is discussed. The variation of optimal tools sequence by using open pocket approach in place of normal accessible area generation approach is discussed in the results.  Decomposable areas are generated which compute the areas traversed by a tool provided another large tool has already machined the pocket feature. Then optimal tool sequences are determined by using optimization algorithms. Two different optimization routines are explained in this thesis. The first is using Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm which generates exact optimal tool sequences but take a lot of computation time. The second is using genetic algorithm which generates near to optimal solution, however, the computation time is less compared to Dijkstra\u2019s approach. The variation of cutting tool sequences and computation times with these optimization algorithms are presented in the test cases. Also, the variation of tool sequence with different feed rates that impact the cutting tool life has been discussed in the results.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9668], "author_name_tesi": "Jayanthi, Bhanu Kishore", "last_name_ssi": "Jayanthi", "middle_name_ssi": "Kishore", "first_name_ssi": "Bhanu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Saldana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Saldana, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Compute aided process planning", "multiple cutting tool selection", "accessible area", "decomposable area"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Poverty Dynamics And Household Response: Disaster Shocks In Rural Bangladesh", "id": "7198", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "505", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "South Asia has the largest concentration of the world\u2019s poor, with over half a billion people surviving on less than a dollar a day.  One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) aims to halve the proportion of the world\u2019s people whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by the year 2015.  The success of poverty alleviation programs in South Asia is critical if this MDG is to be met.  Within South Asia, Bangladesh has the highest incidence of poverty and only India and China have larger numbers of poor people.  It is estimated that nearly half of Bangladesh\u2019s population of 135 million people live below the poverty line. The Human Poverty Index reported by the Human Development Report places Bangladesh at the 86th position among 103 developing countries.  Apart from high poverty levels and low gender empowerment rates, the country also faces yearly natural disasters in the form of floods.  In this dissertation, we first analyze issues relating to chronic and transient poverty following a major catastrophic event using a short panel of household data from Bangladesh.  Bangladesh experienced the largest floods of the century in 1998.  Increase in private borrowing was one of the medium-term impacts of the floods. The International Food Policy Research Institute\u2019s Food Management and Research Support Project (IFPRI-FMRSP) household survey of rural Bangladesh for the years 1998-99 is used for the analysis. The dissertation attempts to identify the characteristics that distinguish between those who are able to eventually escape poverty following the flood (the transient poor) versus those unable to leave poverty (chronic poor).  The study uses cost-of-basic-needs (CBN) poverty lines calculated by the World Bank for Bangladesh for the year 2000.  We use multinomial logit models to asses the determinants of chronic and transient poverty, comparing them to Bangladeshi households that were never poor.  We also use Censored Quantile Regression models to identify the correlates of each kind of poverty. \nWe find that household size, dependency ratio, number of working members, land ownership, location, social assistance and education characterize the chronically poor.  Ownership of physical and human capital make households less likely to be chronically poor.  Larger household size and dependents in the household push families towards chronic poverty.  Increase in number of working members in the family bring in more income and reduce the chances of households being chronically poor.  Given that Bangladesh is an agrarian society and faces yearly floods, it is not surprising that households with heads employed in the trade and self-employment sectors are less likely to be chronically poor compared to those in the agricultural sector.  Long term investments in human and physical assets clearly help households out of chronic poverty.  Apart from household size, dependency ratio, number of working members, and land ownership, the transient poor are characterized by their access to credit.  Credit access and remittances explain transient poverty better.  Our models are not able to characterize the transient poor as well as the chronically poor.  \nAfter having studied the poor and their characteristics, we seek to study how individuals interact and operate within a family or household.  We asses intra-household dynamics (e.g., variations in household bargaining behaviors) with a focus on the household\u2019s expenditure patterns.  Receipt of credit is taken as the measure of bargaining between the head and the spouse.  Food and non-food share equations were individually estimated using random effect OLS and Tobit models to test if participation in credit markets influences food and non-food expenditure shares.  Endogeneity corrections were incorporated whenever tests indicated an endogenous relationship between total household consumption and a particular expenditure share.  2SLS models and simultaneous Tobit models were used to correct for endogeneity between the expenditure shares and total expenditure.  Our results indicate that more men compared to women participate in the credit market.  As is typical of any rural-developing economy, household expenditure share is highest for food.  Amount borrowed by the household head has effects on food expenditure, adult goods and education expenditure.  Amount of credit taken by the household head negatively affects food expenditure and positively affects share spent on adult goods. The negative effect on food expenditure has policy implications related to nutritional intake of children in the household.  Women and girls in the household may also suffer from resultant nutritional deficiencies.  Women\u2019s use of credit has a positive impact on expenditure on children\u2019s goods, durable goods, education and housing.  Results show that resources in the hands of women have implications for improvement in child outcomes, especially educational outcomes.  The positive and significant impact of spouse\u2019s credit on housing share indicates that resources in the hands of women also go towards improvement in household and related outcomes.  We also find that households are more likely to spend in round 2 and round 3 than in round 1 on food, education and personal care and more likely to spend on adult goods, children\u2019s goods, durable goods, fuel, health and housing in round 1 than in round 2 or 3.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [502], "author_name_tesi": "Jayaraman, Anuja ", "last_name_ssi": "Jayaraman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anuja", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics and Demography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Gretchen T Cornwell", "Bee Yan Roberts", "Stephen Michael Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Chair", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "Gretchen T Cornwell, Committee Member", "Bee Yan Roberts, Committee Member", "Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bangladesh", "Poverty", "Intrahousehold", "dynamics", "credit"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "THIN FILM HYDROGEN SENSORS: A MATERIALS PROCESSING APPROACH", "id": "6006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-09-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrogen (H2) is consumed and produced in large quantities by chemical, petroleum, plastic, space and glass industries. Detection and quantitative estimation of H2 in a reliable and efficient  manner is of great value in these applications, not only from a safety stand point but also economically beneficial. Hence the requirement for a simple but efficient hydrogen sensor.\n\nThe simplest hydrogen sensors are based on monitoring changes in electrical properties of group VIII transition metals, especially\npalladium (Pd). Hydrogen adsorbs on Pd surface and diffuses into its bulk altering its electrical and optical properties. This variation is used to detect/estimate hydrogen in the ambiance. However, at high hydrogen concentrations palladium undergoes a phase change. This causes an expansion of the lattice - a problem for fabricating reliable sensors using this metal. This problem was overcome by alloying\npalladium with nickel. Currently, sensors made from palladium alloy thin films (resistors and FET's) can detect/estimate hydrogen from ppm to 100% concentrations. However, these sensors are affected by the total gas pressure and other gases like carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This work, for most part deals with resistors (chemiresistors). Resistors estimate hydrogen by correlating the change in resistance to the hydrogen concentration.\n\nMagnetron sputtering enables the deposition of films of different compositions and morphology. In this work, Pd and Pd/Ni alloy thin films resistors were fabricated by sputtering. Morphology was seen to have a significant effect on the hydrogen sensing property of these films. In the presence of CO, the response of these sensors are extremely sluggish, however by employing SiO2 barrier layer the response was greatly improved. It was noted that despite the sluggish response, the signal from the chemiresistors did saturate to same level as seen in absence of CO from gas mixture, contrary to the earlier results. Also, the geometry of the resistors did not have any effect on the sensor sensitivity or response.\n\nMass spectroscopy and ion energy distribution function (IEDF) analysis are important tools for characterizing processing plasmas. In this work, the sputter discharges were studied using energy and quadrupole mass spectrometer from Hiden. The IEDF of pulsed DC sputter discharges indicated a higher energy peak (~65 eV) and a broad distribution in addition to the low energy peak (~5 eV). The high energy peak was absent from the DC sputter discharge. This high energy peak was\ncorrelated to the pulsing of the DC source and was found to be independent of the target material.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5390], "author_name_tesi": "Jayaraman, RaviPrakash ", "last_name_ssi": "Jayaraman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "RaviPrakash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim", "Mark William Horn", "Russell Messier", "Lawrence Joseph Pilione", "Robert T Mc Grath"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Russell Messier, Committee Chair", "Lawrence Joseph Pilione, Committee Member", "Robert T Mc Grath, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sputtering", "Pulsed DC", "Hydrogen", "Palladium", "Thin film", "Sensor", "Morphology"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Performance Optimization of a Diesel Engine for Dual Fuel Combustion", "id": "15338", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7256", "abstract_tesi": "With recent emphasis on clean fuel and environmental sustainability, it has become increasingly important to look into methods of reducing fuel consumption and emissions while simultaneously maintaining the level of engine performance. Through this study an attempt has been made to observe the effects of using fumigated fuels and an injection of diesel on the performance of an engine and subsequent emissions. The performance of the engine will be judged primarily on brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), brake specific energy consumption (BSEC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), peak cylinder pressure and the apparent heat release rate, while total hydrocarbon content (THC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were considered to analyze the emissions. The data collected was statistically analyzed to determine which factors are most significant in determining the engine\u2019s performance. Exhaust gas recirculation was also used to observe its effects on the above outcomes.\nThe engine used to conduct the tests is a DDC/VM-Motori 2.5L, 4 cylinder, turbocharged, direct injection, light duty diesel engine. The fuels to be fumigated in the cylinder are dimethyl ether (DME) and propane, and the injection is of ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD). Previous studies have shown that DME, which has a low boiling point and high cetane number, tends to advance the ignition point by increasing the low temperature heat release. Methane has also been used in the past along with DME to delay the heat release, provide for a more controlled reaction as well as reduce NOx emissions. This study attempts to achieve the same effects using propane instead of methane along with DME. The concentrations of DME and propane in the fumigated fuel were varied over a span of 0 to 60% energy equivalent of the total fuel requirement. \n\nThe experiments were conducted in two sets, the first set of experiments utilized just DME as the fumigated fuel in the cylinder along with an injection of ULSD. In the second set of experiments, propane was added to the DME to be fumigated in the cylinder. Previous studies have shown favorable trends in the values of BSFC and BSEC due to the addition of a fumigated fuel (usually natural gas) along with an injection of diesel. Similar results were observed for the addition of DME and propane as the fumigated fuels along with diesel along with an increase in BTE. It was observed that the heat release was advanced with increasing energy substitution. There was also an increase in the peak cylinder pressure with increasing fumigation as compared to baseline diesel. Reduction in NOx emissions was observed which further reduced with EGR introduction. THC emissions on the other hand increased with increasing substitution.\n\nOn completion of the experiments, a statistical analysis was performed to determine the factors which had the most influence on the performance of the engine. The tests were treated as a General Full Factorial Experimental Design and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the significant factors. Once, the significant factors were determined, regression analysis was used to determine the effect each factor has on the performance of the engine with interactions between the variables also considered. Based on these conclusions, operating conditions were obtained for the next set of tests. The engine was run at these conditions and the results were noted. It was noticed that BTE increased with increasing substitution with DME and Propane along with a corresponding decrease in BSEC and BSFC values. THC in the emissions decreased with increasing DME but increased with propane. Total NOx, on the other hand reduced with increasing DME and propane energy substitution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7238], "author_name_tesi": "Jayaraman, Srinivas ", "last_name_ssi": "Jayaraman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Srinivas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dual Fuel Combustion", "RCCI", "HCCI", "Diesel engine", "Dimethyl ether (DME)", "propane", "optimization", "emissions", "performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Allosteric Modulating Effects of Dronedarone on Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes at a Novel Allosteric Binding Site", "id": "19919", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9519", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis analyzes the allosteric modulating properties of the antiarrhythmic agent dronedarone across muscarinic receptor subtypes. The allosteric effects of dronedarone were examined because of the unique allosteric modulating properties exhibited by its parent compound amiodarone. One key finding was that amiodarone significantly enhances acetylcholine-stimulated arachidonic acid (AA) release without affecting potency at the M3 receptor. This maximal response enhancement without a shift in potency is a novel allosteric modulating property. Furthermore, amiodarone does not interact competitively with gallamine, one of many muscarinic allosteric modulators binding at an extensively characterized \u201ccommon\u201d allosteric site. Analyzing amiodarone analogs such as dronedarone would further demonstrate the allosteric modulating properties at this novel allosteric site.           \nDronedarone exhibits significantly different allosteric effects on orthosteric ligand affinity, potency, and maximal response that depend on the orthosteric agonist, receptor subtype, and response type in M1 and M3 receptors. For example, dronedarone negatively modulates maximal acetylcholine-stimulated AA release at the M1 receptor but neutrally modulates maximal acetylcholine-stimulated AA release at the M3 receptor. The allosteric effects of dronedarone are mechanistically illustrated by Hall\u2019s allosteric two-state model simulations. Most importantly, dronedarone exhibits a range of allosteric effects across receptor subtypes that collectively have not been displayed by other ligands.    \nInteraction studies were investigated to determine whether amiodarone and dronedarone are binding at a common site. Since amiodarone and dronedarone both significantly enhance maximal pilocarpine-stimulated AA release in M3 receptors it would be difficult to characterize their interaction in a response interaction study. In this scenario, a large difference in efficacy modulation between amiodarone and dronedarone is optimal in determining if one ligand can reverse the efficacy modulating effects of the other ligand. Therefore, the interaction of dronedarone with the amiodarone analog N-ethylamiodarone (NEA) was investigated. NEA was used because previous laboratory findings showed that NEA reversed the amiodarone enhancement of maximal pilocarpine-stimulated AA release in M3 receptors. Thus, the interaction between NEA and amiodarone is consistent with a competitive interaction. We found that NEA also reverses the dronedarone enhancement of maximal pilocarpine-stimulated AA release which indicates an interaction consistent with competition. These two results help show that amiodarone and dronedarone would also interact in a competitive manner.          \nAllosteric modulators can change the off-rate of an orthosteric ligand. Dronedarone slows the rate of [3H] N-methylscopolamine (NMS) dissociation in both M1 and M3 receptors. At the M3 receptor, dronedarone is able to completely reverse the effects of amiodarone on [3H] NMS dissociation. These results are additional evidence that dronedarone is acting allosterically and that the interaction between amiodarone and dronedarone is consistent with competition.          \nIn summary, dronedarone exhibits a wide range of allosteric modulating properties that differ greatly from the allosteric modulating properties displayed by most other muscarinic allosteric modulators. The majority of muscarinic allosteric ligands (including those binding at the \u201ccommon\u201d site) modulate orthosteric ligand potency without changing maximal response. In contrast, dronedarone displays many different allosteric effects on binding and maximal response at a newly discovered allosteric site. The importance of targeting distinct allosteric sites has been shown through GABAA receptor allosteric modulation. Clinical examples of allosteric modulators binding at distinct GABAA receptor allosteric sites include benzodiazepines and general anesthetics which exhibit different pharmacological properties. Identifying new allosteric sites enables the development of more specific drugs that exhibit fewer side effects. Overall, the results presented in this thesis enhance knowledge about the allosteric modulating properties of muscarinic receptors at a novel allosteric binding site.

These models predict that (1) people will first establish permanent settlements in the regions ranked highest for environmental resources; (2) as population grows, people will settle progressively lower-ranked habitats; (3) resource depression should occur in the highest-ranked habitats prior to the occupation of lower-ranked habitats; and (4) under despotic conditions, residents of high-ranked habitats will force newcomers to less desirable locations to prevent resource depression. In this dissertation, I test these models using targeted survey, excavation, laboratory analysis, and radiocarbon dating of archaeological sites on Santa Rosa, the second largest of the Northern Channel Islands. On this island, the early permanent settlements (after ~8000 cal BP) were located in both high- and middle-ranked locations, with the most extensive settlement at the highest-ranked locations and only isolated sites elsewhere. Settlement at a low-ranked habitat is confined to the Late Holocene (after 3600 cal BP). Environmental change independent of human activities, including drought, influences the relative rank of different locations, adding a dynamic aspect to the model and potentially resulting in population movement. Furthermore, the despotic variant of the model (IDD) is prominent late in time as complexity and territoriality developed.\nThis study expands on previous attempts to understand the environmental parameters for settlement on the Northern Channel Islands by modeling fresh water flow in the drainages on Santa Rosa Island. The hydrological model for Santa Rosa Island presented here incorporates geospatial and temporal data for climate (precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, relative humidity, temperature), soils, vegetation, and topography to simulate the complex land-surface-groundwater behavior of island hydrology for hypothetical wet, dry, and median centuries. Drainages on the northwest and east coasts of the island have the largest runoff and are the most resilient to drought. This contributes to their high rank in the IFD/IDD models. \nThis dissertation traces settlement patterns on Santa Rosa Island from the earliest available evidence for permanent settlement during the Middle Holocene (7550-3600 cal BP) through historic contact. The Middle Holocene was associated with increasing sedentism and an elaboration of diverse settlement and special purpose sites. A central place forager model describes the processing and transport costs of red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and California mussel (Mytilus californianus), and how these costs influence archaeological assemblages at coastal and interior settlements. Permanent coastal sites were occupied year-round by larger populations and special purpose sites have faunal assemblages that reflect their distance from coastal shellfish beds. Starting around 1300 cal BP, there were important cultural changes associated with an increase in sociopolitical complexity. Permanent settlement condensed from a dispersed pattern to one that was nucleated at a small number of large coastal villages. The subsequent settlement pattern can be described using the IDD. Village residents prevented others from joining them, pushing the others to more marginal habitats than would be expected in the IFD. Fish was the primary food source at that time, so changes in the distribution of fish and other faunal species provide a useful tool to track these changes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10646], "author_name_tesi": "Jazwa, Christopher S", "last_name_ssi": "Jazwa", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas James Kennett", "James William Wood", "Lee Ann Newsom", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas James Kennett, Dissertation Advisor", "James William Wood, Committee Member", "Lee Ann Newsom, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Archaeology", "California", "Channel Islands", "Behavioral Ecology", "Ideal Free Distribution", "Complexity", "Environmental Archaeology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Sensor Network Interoperability and Reconfiguration through Mobile Agents\n", "id": "10247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1873", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sensor networks generally consist of small devices deployed in an area to perform a task through coordination and communication. The current paradigm in sensor network promotes isolated networks with statically tasked nodes; this hinders the potential for applications to harness the power of fused data from multiple networks. Furthermore, while individual networks subsist in a dynamic environment, the tasks of the nodes are generally static and cannot adapt to changes in application requirements. To address these issues, this dissertation aims at rendering sensor networks interoperable and reconfigurable through reliance on mobile agent technology. The proposed approach intends to leverage data collected from individual networks to increase the set of knowledge available to applications. Our research has led to the introduction of a Reconfigurable and Interoperable Sensor Network (RISN) architecture that relies on mobile agents to achieve the stated goal. RISN provides network interoperability, and supports dynamic tasking of nodes through agent migration. The system further relies on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to handle potential issues associated with the execution time and latency of results by allowing applications to take advantage of hardware accelerators. The use of agent technology introduces security risks to the system; as such, we also investigated the security issues that plague agent-based systems. As the use of agents in practical applications is primarily limited by the security concerns of hosts, our investigation resulted in the introduction of a Distributive and Adaptive Security-Monitoring through Agent Collaboration (DASAC) to address such concerns. DASAC classifies agents based on their execution patterns on current and prior hosts in order to thwart attacks thereby abating the security concerns of hosts. Lastly, as a proof- of-concept, we discuss the implementation of a distributed target-tracking application that relies on the interoperability and reconfiguration of networks that RISN affords to applications, in order to continuously maintain the location of object of interest despite the heterogeneity of the network, and limited views of any one sensor.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1856], "author_name_tesi": "Jean, Evens ", "last_name_ssi": "Jean", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Evens", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ali Hurson", "Dr Ali Hurson", "Dr Robert T Collins", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Ling Rothrock", "Dr Yu (Cathy) Jiao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ali Hurson, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Ali Hurson, Committee Chair", "Dr Robert T Collins, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Dr Yu (Cathy) Jiao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mobile agents", "sensor network", "FPGA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF MEDIA RICHNESS AND\nLEADERSHIP BEHAVIORS ON TEAM-BASED OUTCOMES\n", "id": "10095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Much of the research examining the use of virtual teams has been shown to contain some inconsistencies that have led to a poor understanding of how these teams should be set-up and implemented, for what types of problems these teams should be used, and in what instances they\nwould be maximally effective.

By thoroughly phenotyping these strains for iron, copper, and zinc concentrations throughout the brain and measuring susceptibility to iron deficits in the ventral midbrain, which contains the substantia nigra, we have revealed wide differences in basal brain iron concentrations and susceptibility to ventral midbrain iron deficits.

The approach relies on modeling acoustic propagation, and is designed to estimate the location of a moving source radiating a low frequency tonal signal in a shallow water undersea environment.  As the source moves through the ocean, spatial variability in the acoustic field resulting from multi-path propagation is mapped into temporal amplitude modulation of the received signal.  The received signal is measured using a single hydrophone on the sea floor.  The recorded amplitude modulation contains information about source location that is encoded by propagation effects.  \n\nUnfortunately, accurate prediction of the received signal amplitude modulation is complicated by significant uncertainty regarding values of ocean environmental parameters that acoustic propagation models are sensitive to.  To increase robustness against the resulting data-model mismatch, the localization framework uses Monte Carlo acoustic propagation models to estimate the acoustic field uncertainty resulting from uncertainty about ocean environmental parameters.  The acoustic field uncertainty is represented with probability density functions, which are calculated using parametric, maximum entropy and kernel density estimators.  The resulting probability density functions capture prior knowledge about acoustic propagation and environmental parameters without making unnecessary assumptions.  \n\nThe localization framework uses a grid-based Bayesian approach to recursively calculate the posterior probability density function of source location based on Monte Carlo model results.  The Bayesian approach provides a principled method by which prior knowledge about environmental parameters, source dynamics, source characteristics, and acoustic propagation physics can be combined with received acoustic data to calculate the most likely location of a source.  \n\nThe result is a passive sonar signal processing algorithm that uses acoustic propagation model results to estimate the location of a moving source radiating a tonal signal in shallow water based on the amplitude modulations recorded on a single hydrophone.

Prior studies have shown that they share common genes and mechanisms that underlie their reinforcing properties in the dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The system of interest that modulates reward behavior is the mesolimbic dopamine system, which includes the VTA, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and DA neurons. The primary targets for nicotine are neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) which are found throughout the brain. Studies have suggested that alcohol may be interacting with these receptors directly or indirectly along with nicotine, thus giving a possible mechanism for the co-use of these two substances. In particular, the \u03b16\u03b22* nAChRs are highly expressed within the ventral tegmental area on dopaminergic neurons. Due to the localization of these receptors, researchers have begun to isolate this subset for its possible involvement in modulating alcohol-induced behaviors. In this study, we examined the role of \u03b16\u03b22* receptors in ethanol-induced behaviors by using the antagonist N,N-decane-1,10-diyl-bis-3-picolinium diiodide (bPiDI), a drug that specifically targets \u03b16\u03b22* receptors.

In our locomotor activity studies, bPiDI significantly decreased locomotor activity for specific doses and times during testing in male and female adolescent mice where female mice had higher locomotor activity throughout the experiment in comparison to males. Male and female adolescent mice had initial decreases in ethanol consumption at the highest dose of bPiDI. Initial decreases in tastant consumption for higher doses of bPiDI in male and female mice revealed that the effects on EtOH were not specific to EtOH-mediated effects. The influence of bPiDI on ataxia and sedation were not observed in the experiments reported here for both sexes.

STORM is a new waveform design for modulating information for transmission.  In this thesis, STORM supplements a code division multiaccess (CDMA) communications system to increase the capacity of a CDMA network.  Since current commercial CDMA systems have dedicated spectrum, the capacity is primarily limited by the interference of other CDMA users; thus, power control and multiuser interference mitigation are the focus of CDMA capacity enhancements.  Although extensive research in these areas continues, significant, robust, practical capacity enhancements have been difficult to realize for existing commercial CDMA systems such as Wideband-CDMA (WCDMA).  STORM offers potential to practically enhance the capacity of CDMA systems by robustly realizing more rapid power control and more efficient multiuser interference mitigation.  Additionally, this thesis proposes the practical implementation of STORM into the WCDMA standard/processing.\n\nWith the objective of increasing capacity for a given bandwidth, three analyses are emphasized in this thesis: power control, multiuser detection, and robust information extraction in degraded channels.  The analysis of the state-of-the-art implementations in practical, highly dynamic channels leads to performance bounds that STORM may extend.  Existing power control implementations degrade significantly in rapidly varying channels with many simultaneous users.  Existing multiuser detection requires that the users with the dominant signal energy in the receiver be estimated and tracked; this requirement is difficult to implement in highly dynamic environments and existing approaches are computationally intensive which may lead to significant undesirable processing/energy demands.  \n\nScale Time Offset Robust Modulation (STORM) has been proposed to supplement transmitted reference signaling by adding time scale to the reference signal.  With this additional piece of information, STORM enables rapid synchronization using a low rate processor and enables non-coherent addition of multipath energy.  To analyze these features, STORM is evaluated in both a nonlinear time-varying dispersive acoustic channel using a physically based channel model, and a electromagnetic multipath spherical scattering environment with a finite difference time domain simulation.  STORM is analyzed and its performance is quantified for practical insertion into a WCDMA architecture.  STORM is shown to increase capacity by enhancing multiuser detection and facilitating robust performance in scattering and dispersive environments.  STORM is incorporated into WCDMA uplink and downlink by modifying the the in-phase Gold scrambling code and using the modified code to replace the quadrature scrambling code.  STORM detector performance is evaluated with this modification.  A WCDMA multiuser environment is created with eighty mobile users.  STORM delivers a 6 dB STORM detector signal-to-noise ratio for each user.\n\nSuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) performance has been known to increase when the power ordering of users is estimated between iterations, and to date, this performance increase has not been practically realized due to computational complexity.  STORM practical implementation in WCDMA delivers the ability to detect the user with the highest signal power with significantly fewer calculations improving the feasibility of SIC with power ordering between iterations.

Moreover, it performs this genealogy to demonstrate that the medical model of disability is a nineteenth century phenomenon, and ableism is ultimately shown to be essential to the workings of what Foucault terms biopower.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7648], "author_name_tesi": "Jenkins, Stephanie ", "last_name_ssi": "Jenkins", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Susan Merrill Squier", "Nancy A Tuana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Foucault", "genealogy", "ethics", "disability"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "IN FULL COLOR:\nUNDERSTANDING THE MEANING AND IMPORTANCE OF CULTURE TO\nCOLLEGE STUDENTS OF COLOR THROUGH CULTURAL SELF PORTRAITURE\n\n\n", "id": "7788", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6281", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research study was to explore how students of color at predominantly white institutions define and articulate their culture. Additionally the study was concerned with understanding why their culture and cultural engagement is important to them.  Of particular interest is how students perceive the impact of cultural experiences on their cultural growth/cultural efficacy development.  \nThe goals of the study are:  (1) To contribute to the development of a greater understanding regarding the meanings college students make of culture. (2) To inform the purposes and outcomes for cultural practice (co-curricular programs that focus on race, culture, or ethnicity)  at the university level by providing a student-centered starting point from which programs can be conceptualized; and (3) To determine how culture impacts the personal development of students of color as perceived by the students themselves. \n\nQualitative methods were utilized in this study. The study was methodologically driven by the traditions of phenomenology and portraiture.   Data collection included two components. In the first phase, two group interviews of nine students (18 total) were conducted at two large public institutions. The interviews provided a starting point for students to explore their thoughts about culture and to discuss cultural engagement in college.  The second component involved students in writing cultural self portraits. The portraits were personally narrated written reflections sharing students\u2019 life stories, ideas about culture, opinions of culture in college, and thoughts on the importance of culture. Students were provided a basic guide with questions to answer in the self portrait, but were generally offered freedom of choice and creativity regarding what to include, how to structure their portrait, and the length of the document. \n\nThe study was conceptually guided by combining research on ethnic identity development and critical race theory with the theory of actionable space.  Ethnic identity theories informed the understanding of the process by which individuals gain an ethnic sense of self and the various issues confronting students of color as they become more ethnically aware. Actionable Space is also a continual process theory.  The theory was used to understand the various types of personal practices and activities that help individuals to develop an understanding of and appreciation for their culture. Critical Race theory influenced the use of narrative in the study and illustrated how narrative can provide opportunities to hear the authentic and personal voice of those studied. \nThe data revealed that to college students of color, culture included more functional life tools than ritualistic practices.  To the students in this study, culture was defined as a toolkit that included family bonds, life survival strategies, the practical and social functions of art and religion, a value for education, and a sense of legacy. Students indicated that culture was indeed important to them for both institutional and personal reasons. Cultural engagement was expected in college to help them adjust and to feel connected to campus. But more importantly, they saw it as a necessary venue through which they could come to better know and understand themselves.  Culture was revealed as an important protector against all of life\u2019s challenges including family struggle, community failure, educational isolation, and racial pain. \nThe very personal and intimate views of culture shared in this study offer cultural practitioners in any field a better understanding of how contemporary young people may approach and understand culture.  This is particularly relevant for those professionals that develop cultural programs and initiatives aimed at this population. These programs must be framed by viewing culture through the same lens of understanding as the current student population. Therefore, the study offers a contemporary view of culture in communities of color.  The study also provides new information on how and why culture is important to college students. This research contributes to the existing base of knowledge on the benefits of cultural diversity within higher education.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6281], "author_name_tesi": "Jenkins, Toby S", "last_name_ssi": "Jenkins", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Toby", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gerald K Letendre", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "Shaun Harper", "Margaret Ann Lorah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gerald K Letendre, Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Chair", "Shaun Harper, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Culture", "Portraiture", "Multicultural", "Students of Color"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPING AN ANIMAL MODEL FOR PREDICTION OF INDIVIDUAL VULNERABILITY TO ADDICTION-LIKE BEHAVIOR FOR HEROIN", "id": "13607cxj220", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13607", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drug addiction has become a social epidemic. Approximately 15% of humans who try alcohol or cocaine become addicted (J. C. W. Anthony, Lynn A.; Kessler, Ronald C., 1994), and 50% of those who try heroin become dependent (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration., 2012). The cost of substance abuse in the US is estimated to exceed $700 billion annually (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015). While the initial decision to take a drug is usually voluntary, with continued use, brain changes impair a person\u2019s ability to resist drugs. Use evolves to abuse, which evolves to compulsive use, often with multiple periods of abstention and relapse. Addiction is characterized as a chronic brain disease of relapse and use despite harmful consequences (Leshner, 1997; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2012; Roberts, Morgan, & Liu, 2007; Volkow, Koob, & McLellan, 2016).\n\nAddiction can be studied in the laboratory using animal models designed to reproduce characteristics of the human addiction process including behaviors such as craving, loss of control, and relapse. To this end, drug self-administration models are very useful. Limited access models allow for 1-2 h access to drug/day. This model can be used to examine the initiation phase of drug-taking (i.e., acquisition), and is also useful in identifying factors that contribute to vulnerability to the reinforcing effects of drugs (Campbell & Carroll, 2000). Limited access to drug, however, fails to recapitulate a key feature of addiction, escalation. In humans, drug-taking is generally found to increase over time. An alternative model, the extended access model (allowing for 6 h or more access to drug/day) reproduces the transition from controlled to compulsive use known as escalation (Roberts et al., 2007). In this case, however, overall drug exposure differs between those who escalate and those who do not. A third model, the intermittent access model, supports identical drug-taking, but still allows for behavioral stratification of subjects into those exhibiting low and high addiction-like behaviors for drug. Specifically, the intermittent access model ranks animals by individual differences in drug-seeking behavior, willingness to work for drug, and persistence in responding for drug, all criteria for the diagnosis of substance use disorder from the then current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000).\n\nIn a final model under consideration here, rats suppress intake of a palatable taste cue, such as saccharin, when paired with a drug of abuse, such as morphine or cocaine. Avoidance of the drug-paired cue was originally interpreted as a conditioned taste aversion (Nachman, 1970). In 1997, we proposed a new interpretation (Grigson, 1997), referred to as reward comparison. This interpretation posits that avoidance is due to devaluation of the otherwise palatable saccharin cue in anticipation of the availability of the rewarding properties of the drug of abuse. Additional studies revealed large individual differences whereby some rats, referred to as large suppressers, exhibited greater avoidance of the drug-paired cue than did others, referred to as small suppressers (Gomez, Leo, & Grigson, 2000).\n\nPublished data show that greater avoidance of the drug-paired cue at test is associated with greater drug-seeking and drug-taking (Grigson & Twining, 2002b; Imperio & Grigson, 2015; Twining, Bolan, & Grigson, 2009). Moreover, these individual differences in avoidance of the drug-paired taste cue emerge very early in training, within 3-5 trials. It is not clear, however, whether addiction-like behaviors also occur early. In general, addiction is thought to take a long time (Deroche-Gamonet, Belin, & Piazza, 2004) and/or a great deal drug exposure (Ahmed & Koob, 1998) to develop. After the Introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 tests whether addiction develops early over a short 5-day study where brief access to the saccharin cue predicts 6 h access to heroin. Chapter 3 describes a study testing whether early avoidance of the drug-paired cue will predict escalation of heroin self-administration using the extended access paradigm. Chapter 4 uses the intermittent access model to test whether early avoidance of the drug-paired cue will predict individual differences in the expression of addiction-like behaviors in the intermittent access model. Chapter 5 presents data from 3 taste-drug pairing trials to stratify rats into large and small suppresser groups, and then examines their neuronal tissue for differences which could help explain early individual vulnerability to addiction-like behavior for heroin. Chapter 6 will review and discuss the findings of the present chapters and summarize conclusions from the collected data.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15529], "author_name_tesi": "Jenney, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Jenney", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "James Robert Connor", "Andras Hajnal", "Robert G Levenson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Committee Chair", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["addiction", "drugs of abuse", "rat model", "self-administration", "heroin", "individual vulnerability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Household Structure, Dynamics, and Economics in a Preindustrial Farming Population: The Northern Orkney Islands, Scotland, 1851-1901\n", "id": "11116", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2516", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the demography, economy, and structure of agricultural households in the Northern Orkney Islands, Scotland, in the last half of the nineteenth century (1851-1901).  The household is used as the unit of social, demographic, and economic analysis throughout this thesis.  Household structure in Orkney is described using both case studies and aggregate data.  From this information, the compound household, which would go unnoticed if only documentary evidence were used, is defined, described, and integrated into existing systems of household classification.  Patterns of household types found in Orkney are compared to published accounts of historical populations throughout Europe.  Household dynamics are explored using event-history models of the transition between household types.  Finally, the household as an economic unit is examined in a study of the hiring of life-cycle servants, both generally and with respect to the sex of the servant.  \n\nMultiple sources of information, about both the physical farmsteads and the people who occupied them, show that households in Northern Orkney are more structurally and genealogically complex than has been previously reported for Northwest Europe in general.  These findings could not have been made without the use of data sources that supplement documentary evidence, such as census listings.  It may be the case that the kinds of data commonly used by historical demographers have actually underestimated the degree of household complexity in the preindustrial past, as household complexity may actually be \u201chidden\u201d in these records.  Event-history models of transitions between household types demonstrate that compound and extended households have rather different dynamic tendencies.  Finally, analyses of the presence of life-cycle servants show that households are adaptive economic units that can respond to labor shortages (both general and sex-specific) through the hiring of life-cycle servants.        \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2498], "author_name_tesi": "Jennings, Julia Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Jennings", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James William Wood", "James William Wood", "Patricia Lyons Johnson", "Stephen Augustus Matthews", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Debashis Ghosh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James William Wood, Dissertation Advisor", "James William Wood, Committee Chair", "Patricia Lyons Johnson, Committee Member", "Stephen Augustus Matthews, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["life-cycle servants", "traditional agriculture", "Orkney", "historical demography", "households"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Functional Recognition of the Nucleosome by Chromatin Complexes Ran/rcc11 and Lsd1/corest", "id": "26678", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11032", "defended_at_dtsi": "2104-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chromatin is a combination of protein and nucleic acid whose function includes, but is not limited to, higher order compaction of DNA within eukaryotic cells.  The most fundamental subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome.  In my studies, I investigate two chromatin complexes, Ran/RCC1 and LSD1/CoREST, to address the fundamental question of how chromatin factors recognize and interact with the nucleosome.  Each of these complexes has distinctly different cellular functions ranging from nucleocytoplasmic transport, nuclear envelope formation, and mitotic spindle formation in the case of Ran/RCC1 to transcriptional regulation in the case of LSD1/CoREST.\nRan GTPase functions as a molecular switch that is toggled between the active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound states.  RCC1 is a chromatin bound, guanine exchange factor for Ran that is responsible for nucleotide exchange from the GDP to GTP states creating a high nuclear concentration of RanGTP.   Previous work disclosed that the nucleosome enhances RCC1 mediated nucleotide exchange two-fold.  I have identified a hydrophobic face of Ran\u2019s C-terminal \u03b1-helix that is required for nucleosomal enhancement of RCC1 mediated nucleotide exchange.  The hydrophobic face of Ran\u2019s C-terminal \u03b1-helix cross-links to the first 20 amino acids of histone H4 as well as nucleosomal DNA.  Given that a nucleosome with deletions of all histone tails still maintained two-fold nucleosomal enhanced Ran nucleotide exchange suggests that enhancement may result from interaction between the Ran C-terminal \u03b1-helix and nucleosomal DNA. \nThe LSD1/CoREST (lysine specific demethylase 1/Co-repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor) complex is a histone H3K4 mono- and di- demethylase that is associated with transcriptional repression.  Previous work has shown that while LSD1 can demethylate peptide substrates, CoREST is required for LSD1 demethylase activity on the nucleosome.  Prior to my work, enzymatic activity of LSD1/CoREST was addressed using colorimetric assays on peptides.  I have developed a more sensitive fluorescence based assay using di-methyl lysine analog nucleosomal substrates to investigate LSD1/CoREST demethylase activity on the nucleosome.  I have identified that LSD1/CoREST prefers a nucleosomal substrate containing extranucleosomal linker DNA beyond the 147 base pair nucleosome.  In addition, symmetrical extensions from both sides of the dyad are preferred over a single extension from one side of the dyad. \nThe results of my work provides further insight into the role of the nucleosome, not just as a structural component that acts to compact the genome, but as a participant in the activity of chromatin factors. My studies expand the chromatin and cellular biology fields by identifying a potential mechanism into how the Ran GTPase interacts with the nucleosome to enhance Ran activity and alter its nucleotide state allowing for the development of the Ran nucleotide gradient responsible for cellular localization of mitotic processes and nucleocytoplasmic transport. My results also demonstrate that LSD1/CoREST activity is enhanced in the presence of extranucleosomal DNA providing a role of extranucleosomal DNA in enzymatic activity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10609], "author_name_tesi": "Jennings, Matthew James", "last_name_ssi": "Jennings", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Song Tan", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "B Tracy Nixon", "Tae Hee Lee", "Joseph C.

This results in errors as large as 14% when predicting the wall temperature for internally cooled turbine blades. A loosely coupled conjugate heat transfer method called Iterative Conjugate Heat Transfer (ICHT) was developed to incorporate conjugate effects. A Reduced-Order Film Model (ROFM) was also developed to use experimental data or empirical correlations in place of turbulence models for solving film-cooled flow.\n        ROFM automates the process of setting up and solving CFD solutions.

Theory and research on social networks and social support are integrated to frame this investigation into the communicative processes through which individuals elicit and receive support from their networks to emerge resilient within the wounded warrior context. \tTo begin, Chapter 1 introduces key concepts presented in this dissertation. This includes a description of the experience of caregiving in military families, an overview of the topic of resilience and is followed by a discussion about social networks and social support. Chapter 2 presents a review of the literature on non-normative stressors, social support, and coping. Specifically, I offer insights into the stressful nature of military families. In Chapter 3, I discuss the factors that reside within the spousal caregiver and their social network that influence their interactions and perceptions of support, and I propose a series of hypotheses linking these variables to resilient outcomes.\n\tChapter 4 describes the methodology for the dissertation study and begins by describing participants, procedures, and the measures utilized in the three-phase study. In the first phase, information was collected from caregivers, which included soliciting the identities of up to six of their social network members. Phase two focused on gathering information from those network members, who described an interaction with the caregivers and reported on perceptions of the caregiver/network member relationship. Finally, phase three involved collecting the caregivers\u2019 views of interactions reported by the network members, as well as the caregivers\u2019 perceived stress level and current well-being.

The analyses revealed caregivers\u2019 privacy concerns were associated with decreases in expression efficacy, whereas caregivers\u2019 face concerns were associated with decreases in outcome efficacy. Furthermore, face concerns and outcome efficacy tended to correspond with an increase in anxiety over time. Results also revealed that network members\u2019 proclivity to provide support was associated with decreased caregiver vigor, and increases in anxiety, depression, and distress. Network members\u2019 perceptions of caregivers\u2019 explicitness was positively and significantly related to increases in discrepancies between network member and caregivers\u2019 perceptions of emotional, informational, network and esteem support sought. Both caregiver and network member perspectives of caregivers\u2019 emotional interference predicted authenticity of network members\u2019 expression and both caregivers and network members\u2019 authenticity significantly predicted caregivers\u2019 vigor, anxiety, and depression. Discrepancies in emotional support were also linked to increases in both anxiety and distress for the caregiver.

Columnar collision efficiencies in the model are calculated using a new theoretical\nmethod derived from spherical collision efficiencies. The model is able to evolve mass,\nshape, and fall speed of growing ice across a range of temperatures, and it compares well\nwith wind tunnel data. The onset time of riming and the effects of riming on mass and\nfall speed between \u22123\u25e6C to \u221216\u25e6C are modeled, as compared with wind tunnel data\nfor a liquid water content of 0.4 g m \u22123 . Under these conditions, riming is constrained\nto the more isometric habits near \u221210\u25e6C and \u22124\u25e6C. It is shown that the mass and fall\nspeed of riming dendrites depend on the liquid drop distribution properties, leading to a\nrange of mass-size and fall speed-size relationships. Riming at low liquid water contents\nis shown to be sensitive to ice crystal habit and liquid drop size. Moreover, very light\nriming can affect the shape of ice crystals enough to reduce vapor growth and suppress\noverall mass growth, as compared with those same ice crystals if they were unrimed.\nPart two details a novel bulk microphysics model that simultaneously evolves\nmass, shape, and density due to both riming and vapor growth. A direct result is that\nconversion rates between, for example, snow and graupel, are not needed. The method\nis unique because ice crystal shape is predicted and two measures of size are included\nas prognostic variables. Ice is nucleated as either planar or columnar, determined by\ntemperature. The model is tested in comparison to a traditional bulk scheme in a kine-\nmatic framework, where feedbacks between microphysics and dynamics are neglected.\nSeparating planar and columnar ice, predicting ice crystal shape, and allowing shape to\nevolve naturally during vapor growth and riming results in ice crystals being sorted in\nphysical space because fall speed depends on shape. Simulations show that predicting ice\ncrystal shape leads to a different spatial precipitation rate distribution compared to the\ntraditional method of separating and converting between ice categories. It is also shown\nthat when system dynamics evolve in time, both spatial precipitation rate distribution\nand domain total precipitation rate depend on snow and graupel conversion thresholds\nin traditional models. Finally, in certain environments columnar ice rimes while planar\nice does not showing that riming is habit dependent. The impact of ice crystal habit on\nprecipitation rate can be just as prominent as an order of magnitude change in cloud\nnumber concentration.\nIn part three the microphysics parameterization is tested in a WRF squall line\ncase. The results show that the modeling approach to ice microphysics successfully cap-\ntures features of the squall line including the transition zone and enhanced stratiform\nprecipitation region. Traditional bulk microphysics schemes have difficulty modeling\nthese features consistently. Comparing the results with microphysical retrievals and\nother modeling studies, it is shown that rimed ice advected out of convective updrafts\ncan be the sole source of enhanced stratiform precipitation without additional mass\ngrowth in the mesoscale updraft.

What are the experiences of working-class students attending formal higher education?  How do working-class students maintain aspects of their identity?  \n     This study used a qualitative methodology and heuristic inquiry.  This was accomplished by conducting a series of in-depth interviews with current and former adult working-class students.  The purpose of these interviews was to elicit open-ended responses that enabled understanding and captured the points of view of these students.  The participants\u2019 perceptions and experiences resulted in an understanding of their worldview and exploration of their social class awareness.\n     The research findings centered on three areas \u2013 working-class identity and meaning, experiences in higher education, and responsibilities of higher education and the working-class student.  The participants identified characteristics of working-class identity; how they have maintained this identity; the roles, responsibilities and meaning of work; and dynamics of the intersection of social class.  Findings regarding experiences in higher education included influencers and motivators to attend higher education; challenges of the working-class student; and attitudes, attributes, and motivations while engaged in higher education.  \n     The thesis provided an analysis related to social class identity and findings on how working-class students maintain aspects of their identity while adopting aspects of middle-class identity as well as how critical consciousness is developed.  Other areas expanded upon were the challenges of the working-class student, specifically feelings of impostership, lack of cultural capital, and cultural suicide.

This research focuses on changes in the geographic distribution of Mexican-born farmworkers over time, earnings inequalities among Mexican-born farmworkers living in traditional agricultural settlement states (California and Texas) and those living in new agricultural destination states, and the structural changes in the agriculture industry that are increasing the demand for hired farm workers. Findings suggest that there has been a dramatic shift in the geographic distribution of this population since 1980, as the proportion of Mexican-born farmworkers living outside of traditional settlement areas has increased. Also, in the 1980s, Mexican-born farmworkers living in traditional settlement states had higher earnings than those residing elsewhere, but that since 1990 earnings have been greater for farmworkers living in new destination states. Through decomposition analysis, this reversal of earnings inequalities is found to be more attributable to changes in the structure of earnings less to changes in the population composition.

Coming from poor households, and having little formal education, children work as domestics because of a need to sustain themselves and their families. Child domestics are often compelled to work under oppressive conditions. Domestic work is not a solution to the economic problems of poor children. However, in the short term we must recognize child domestics as workers, increase their social status, and fulfill their rights. Child domestics\u2019 rights can be protected by mobilizing agency in all sectors and scales of Bangladeshi and international society, such as implementing laws, work contracts, monitoring, and activities organized by NGOs and the government focusing on education and awareness. Access to education is important because of the potential of making these children visible to society. Laws protecting working children do not reach secluded spaces of private homes where the labor and bodies of child domestics are available to employers around the clock. In non-domestic spaces, children can meet people who may help them if there are problems with the employers. Access to semi-public spaces such as the rooftops of apartment buildings is critical to child domestics as spaces of networking and socialization. Some NGOs are using rooftops as access points for educational programs. The material conditions affecting the children are set in discourses of \u2018childhood\u2019 and \u2018child labor\u2019. I examine discourses and workspaces with a view to improve the quality of life of these children. By combining discourse analysis and critical ethnography, I analyze three main discourses that shape the space-time frameworks and everyday lives of child domestic workers: 1) A human rights discourse which conceives of childhood as a universal category where education and social participation should be a part of a child\u2019s life; 2) An employers\u2019 discourse which constructs a dichotomy between their biological children and their child domestics, and finally; 3) A child domestics\u2019 discourse which centers on work as a necessary duty, and where the notion of childhood ties to their identity as servants, feelings of inferiority and a desire for respect. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3345], "author_name_tesi": "Jensen, Kari Bolstad", "last_name_ssi": "Jensen", "middle_name_ssi": "Bolstad", "first_name_ssi": "Kari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lakshman S Yapa", "Chris Benner", "Lorraine Dowler", "Amy Glasmeier", "David Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lakshman S Yapa, Committee Chair", "Chris Benner, Committee Member", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "Amy Glasmeier, Committee Member", "David Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["child domestic work"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Archaic Modernism and Spanish Poetry, 1898-1975", "id": "14515mfj112", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14515", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Archaic Modernism examines the role that long-standing discourses of Spain\u2019s cultural belatedness play in the complex character of its modern poetry through the Franco Era. While commentators from the first-century histories of Pliny the Elder, to the early twentieth-century proclamations of futurist F.T. Marinetti, Spain has been marked as outmoded, oppressive, and culturally obsolete, this dissertation challenges that Spain\u2019s supposed archaism\u2014a term I employ to gather the various stereotypes regarding Spain\u2019s backwardness\u2014has had an entirely negative effect on its cultural production. Instead, I argue that many modern poets engage in complex rewritings of the past that form the basis of an active and engaged aesthetic, inspiring experimental forms and critical perspectives that challenge the institutions they appropriate. While the use of primitive, primordial, and traditional motifs is a common feature to many canonical writers and artists of the modernist period across Europe and the Anglophone world, Spain exhibits a complex relationship to the past given its perennial marginalization as a belated nation. This special relationship to the suspect ideologies of the past allows us to reconsider the role that Spain played in the development of a broader European modernism. Furthermore, examining the continual debates within Spain about the relationship of its past and its literary culture, also shows us how poets consciously worked to recuperate certain truths, expressions, and inquiries associated with its archaic institutions as a means to establish a national cultural identity resistant to the marginalizing views of a hegemonic Northern European culture. Following this, I examine several Spanish poets who focused on spiritual notions such as irrationality, mysticism, and care for the suffering\u2014ideas opposed to what they saw as an abhorrent Northern European, \u201cprotestant\u201d modernization that had alienated human life through its rationalized quest for economic progress and material comforts.

However, despite the common belief on the effect of education on enhancing health, recent comparative research reported that the association between education and obesity, especially in developing countries, was mixed largely due to different population contexts from developed countries. \n\tThe moderating effects of population contexts on the association between education and the likelihood of being overweight were examined for female foreign-born immigrants in the United States. Previous research focused on different national development level of the countries of origin as a key indicator causing the variation of education-overweigh gradient among immigrant population. However, preexisting studies lack the detailed information on different contributions to moderating education gradient by specific national indicators.\n\tDistinguished from the previous literature, different moderating effects on education gradient by various measures for pre-migration environment were highlighted, using the national-level indicators: life expectancy, national level of educational expansion, GDP per capita, and national nutrition transition status. As a result, while life expectancy and GDP per capita in pre-migration settings were not statistically significant to predict the likelihood of being overweight among immigrant population and the variation of education gradient, educational expansion level and nutritional status had significant moderating effects on education gradient on overweight.\n\tIn addition, it was observed that the patterns of convergence were slightly different by national moderators. After the arrival at the United States, less educated immigrants from the origin countries with the lower level of nutrition transition became much more vulnerable to the risk of being overweight. In pre-migration settings, they were uniquely protected from weight gains because of less prevalence of energy-dense foods, regardless of educational attainment. However, after their arrival at the United States, they were forced to accept westernized diet styles consisting of high animal fat and sugar/sweeteners and less educated people became more extremely disadvantaged in keeping healthy body shapes. On the contrary, there was no significant pattern of convergence of the moderating effect of national level of education expansion. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10691], "author_name_tesi": "Jeon, Ha Ram", "last_name_ssi": "Jeon", "middle_name_ssi": "Ram", "first_name_ssi": "Ha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "Katerina Bodovski", "Soo Yong Byun", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Soo Yong Byun, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Education gradient", "Overweight", "Obesity", "Immigrant's health"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "energy consumption analysis in discrete manufacturing based on simulation approach", "id": "17637", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8408", "abstract_tesi": "The amount of consumed energy to manufacture products is important managerial information for decision making as well as environmental considerations.

In detail, the simulation software HySPEED (Hybrid Simulator for Production, Energy, and Emission Dynamics) has been developed and is used to measure a spent energy amount with each set of various parameters as well as to take yearlong continuous production into consideration. The collected data from designed simulation experiments is then analyzed with ANOVA to find more energy-influential factors, and identified factors are compared with other factors of a regression model built on industrial energy surveys.

Since an energy amount to be consumed in manufacturing systems is closely connected to energy costs and environmental consequences, these managerial decisions can have long-lasting effects. Hence, making informed decisions with the aid of energy estimation tools is important to manufacturing firms. Estimating energy consumption in manufacturing is not, however, straightforward. There are a number of different manufacturing processes, and the energy consumption of each process is dependent on many operational parameters. Thus, for a better manufacturing energy analysis, the power profiles need to be collected and analyzed from real manufacturing machines, and various methods including analytical and simulation approaches should be proposed and tested based on the collected data. Furthermore, since many previous studies are focusing mainly on mean power demands for evaluating energy consumption, variability of manufacturing power demands also has to be investigated for exploring how the uncertainty impacts on manufacturing energy.\n\nIn order to address the issues, this dissertation proposes various but useful methods. At the beginning, this study shows an analytical manufacturing energy model based on queueing network theory. Considering Markovian and Non-Markovian assumptions, we present the manufacturing energy consumption in a closed form equation. Then, our analysis develops the previous model further for energy efficiency benchmarking. Comparing the manufacturing energy in a hypothetical system with peers in the U.S., the proposed model shows how to assess the energy efficiency in a manufacturing plant based on the simulation and stochastic frontier analysis approaches. After the energy estimation and energy efficiency assessment are discussed, our study transcends the previous studies by considering uncertainty and variability on the manufacturing electrical demands.

Routing in ad hoc wireless networks is made additionally challenging by the dynamic nature of the communication channel. In this thesis, we present an ant-based multipath QoS routing protocol that utilizes a link metrics combining multiple weighted criteria. We apply the proposed scheme to various fields in ad hoc wireless networks and study the performance via simulations.\n\nWe present an energy-efficient multipath routing algorithm, named PPRA, utilizing the proposed metrics. We also study the performance of our scheme considering both energy and latency for two classes of traffic: latency-critical and latency-non-critical. Our study indicates that PPRA shows good minimum energy performance, an important factor for maximized network lifetime, with small amount of additional overhead.\n\nWe investigate the performance of our scheme for a geocasting protocol that we designed combining anycasting, restricted broadcasting, and local broadcasting. The proposed scheme, named GeoPPRA, reduces the routing overhead significantly. Also, GeoPPRA performs energy-efficient load balancing that increases network lifetime. Simulation results show significant reductions of routing overhead and energy consumption and show comparable performance to the state of the art geocasting protocols.\n\nWe then apply PPRA to a security context in order to avoid malicious packet dropping. Ad hoc wireless networks are more vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks since nodes are assumed to be trustworthy and cooperative. In our approach, messages are distributed over multiple paths between source and destination. In proportion to the throughput of each path, a routing table is updated and, subsequently, paths that contain malicious nodes are naturally avoided. Simulation results show that our scheme can avoid most of the paths that contain malicious nodes.\n\nFor delay-sensitive applications, it is important to minimize the probability that the end-to-end packet transfer delay is greater than a certain threshold. We propose an overlay framework that considers both delay and mobility to satisfy the QoS requirements of delay-sensitive applications.

The tetragonal 0.62PMN-0.38PT single crystals poled along the <001> direction (the spontaneous polarization direction) have a stable single domain and show\nhigh transparency from the visible to Near-IR range. Using the Mach-Zender interferometry\nmethod, large linear E-O coeffcients r33 = 70 pm/V, r31 = 25 pm/V, and r15 = 558 pm/V were characterized. P(VDF-TrFE) based terpolymers shows a large Kerr effect where a refractive index change of -2.6 % can be induced under an electric field of 80 V/\u00c2\u00b5m. When combined with the electrostrictive strain, the terpolymer film exhibits a total -5.6 % optical pathlength change under a field of 80 V/\u00c2\u00b5m.

By changing the structure of comb-shape electrode for the bottom electrode and the polymer thickness, it was calculated that we could\ncontrol the electric field distribution leading the different level of strain for grating. This\nnew tunable grating has the advantage of simple fabrication and easy integration. In our first experimental demonstration, 24 % of the first order diffraction effciency was observed with 100 V/\u00c2\u00b5m. For the strain tunable FPI, which for the terpolymer films under mechanically clamped condition is 1.3 % under 100 V/\u00c2\u00b5m field, we show that a tunable range of 22.5 nm can be obtained at wavelengths near 1.5 \u00c2\u00b5m. On the other hand, the FPI using a terpolymer film directly as the cavity of the etalon shows a smaller tunability (0.78 % under 100 V/\u00c2\u00b5m)due to the opposite sign of the strain and refractive index change. In addition, since the conventional photolithograph technique damages the P(VDF-TrFE) based polymers, stencil mask method was tested to fabricate a strain tunable frequency selective surface.\nIn addition to the materials themselves, high performance tunable devices can be accomplished from the artificial periodic structures, so called Photonic Crystals (PCs). Near bandedge of PCs, optical properties can be very sensitive to the changes of the unit cell dimension and the refractive index of the constituents of the PCs. When calculating the optical properties in PCs, most calculations are based on the infinite\nsize of PCs. However, real deivces should have finite size and their propertiese are different from those of the infinite size of PCs. To predict the optical properties in real PCs device, we compared the light propagation properties between infinitely extended and finite size dielectric multilayer layer in terms of photonic crystals (PCs) along the wave propagation direction. It is shown that the multiple reflections at the two end interfaces of a finite size PC give an influence on both the transmittance and phase velocity (and also the group velocity as well as the effective refractive indexes neff). The results clearly demonstrate the importance of the two end interfaces of a finite size PC on the e\u000bective properties of photonic crystals, which could be quite different from those deduced from an infinitely extended photonic crystal. For device applications, finite size effect was applied to design the photonic crystals lenses.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1525], "author_name_tesi": "Jeong, Dae Yong ", "last_name_ssi": "Jeong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dae Yong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Amar S Bhalla", "Shizhuo Yin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Amar S Bhalla, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tunable device", "relaxor ferroelectric", "electro-optic"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Simplified Ceiling Radiant Cooling Panel and Enthalpy Wheel Models for Dedicated Outdoor Air System Design", "id": "6243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2950", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The significant energy savings and excellent thermal and environmental benefit potential of dedicated outdoor air systems (DOAS) operating in parallel with ceiling radiant cooling panels (CRCP) is widely recognized.

However, the universal lack of appropriate DOAS/CRCP design tools is holding the technology out of the marketplace. The central thrust of this research is to provide simple and practical design tools needed to bring this DOAS/CRCP cooling technology into the HVAC system community.\nIn this research, simplified yet reliable CRCP and enthalpy wheel models were developed by statistically analyzing the performance data generated by established analytical or numerical models for each device. Using the 2k factorial experiment design method, the major design parameters and their combinations which show significant effects on the CRCP and enthalpy wheel performance were identified. And then, linear regression correlations for each device were derived as a function of those selected design parameters. The proposed correlations for the top insulated and free hanging type CRCP can estimate the panel cooling capacity not only for the natural convection condition but also for the mixed convection condition. And the proposed enthalpy wheel correlations return the sensible and latent effectiveness for the normal operating speed (i.e. 20rpm) as a function of six known variables; incoming OA and EA temperature and relative humidity, face velocity, and air flow ratio. The total effectiveness can also be calculated once the sensible and the latent effectiveness are determined. The panel cooling capacity and enthalpy wheel effectiveness values predicted by the proposed correlations corresponded well to the manufacturer\u00a1\u00afs data, other existing models, and preliminary experimental research results found in the literature.\nThe general DOAS/CRCP system design procedures and economical enthalpy wheel control strategy for DOAS operation were also proposed in this research. Those will be a useful tool for the engineers who have been forced to design the DOAS/CRCP system on the basis of qualitative merits, limited experience, and conservative estimates.

Frequency division duplex (FDD) operation and static time division duplex (S-TDD) operation may result in poor frequency utilization for this type of traffic, since the transmission bandwidth of these operations is fixed. Meanwhile, dynamic time division duplex (D-TDD) operation can support such asymmetric and dynamic traffic robustly, by adapting its transmission bandwidth according to traffic pattern. Thus, significant statistical multiplexing gain can be obtained in D-TDD operation. However, D-TDD is vulnerable in terms of strong interfering signals coming from base stations in co-channel cells, while the reference cell is busy with uplink receptions. Since the strong interference presence is due to the unique feature of D-TDD, the statistical multiplexing gain, which is also obtained via the unique feature, may not be obtained.\n\tIn this thesis, we develop an analytic model of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) distribution in D-TDD systems. Using the analytic model, we show that the probability density function (PDF) of SIR distribution in D-TDD system has two peaks, while that in conventional S-TDD systems has one peak. From the investigation of PDF, we show how the strong co-channel interference severely degrades the performance of SIR outage probability in D-TDD systems, when omni-directional antennas are employed at base station (BS) sites and subscriber (SC) sites. Also, we estimate the spatial resolution in terms of antenna beamwidth to obtain the target outage probability, when a spatial filter is employed at BSs. Numerical results show that 3.4-degree beamwidth is required to obtain an outage probability of 1% at the threshold SIR value of 17 dB.\n\tTo suppress the effect of strong co-channel interference in D-TDD systems, we develop a time slot allocation strategy (TSA), exploiting spatially distributed SCs\u00a1\u00af location over the cell coverage, combined with cost effective sector antenna layouts. We propose two TSA algorithms: the MaxMin {SIR} and the Max {SIR} algorithms. The MaxMin {SIR} is an exhaustive search algorithm, which searches the best pair set of time slots and SCs among all possible combination sets. The performance of this algorithm is used as an benchmark. Meanwhile, MaxMin {SIR} searches the pair in a specific order, which reduces the computational complexity, substantially. Our simulation results show that both algorithms perform well for a fairly large range of dynamic traffic pattern and the difference in performance between the two algorithms is not noticeable. Also, we compare the performance of TSA to that of adaptive array antennas. Our simulation shows that the performance of D-TDD system employing TSA, combined with 15 sector antennas, is comparable that employing adaptive array antennas with 26 sensing elements.\n\tFinally, we compare the spectral efficiency of TDD systems for various frame-loading conditions. In the analysis, we consider two types of modulation schemes: fixed modulation and adaptive modulation. Fixed modulation is suitable for the delay-sensitive traffic, while adaptive modulation is proper for the delay-tolerant traffic, since the transmission rate in delay-tolerant traffic can be reduced and the data bits can be buffered, until the channel quality is improved. In fixed modulation system, it is observed that the spectral efficiency of D-TDD systems can be improved significantly by employing TSA strategy. For instance, as much as 9 times higher spectral efficiency is obtained by employing TSA strategy, when the traffic is highly dynamic and the frame is fully loaded. Meanwhile, in adaptive modulation system, the spectral efficiency of D-TDD systems does not improve significantly by employing TSA strategy. This is due to the fact that the objective of the proposed system is to maximize the minimum value of SIR, not to improve the SIR values over all uplink time slots. Our numerical results show that the merit of statistical multiplexing can be obtained for a fairly large range of frame loading, by employing the proposed TSA strategy, compared to S-TDD systems.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6583], "author_name_tesi": "Jeong, Wun-Cheol ", "last_name_ssi": "Jeong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wun-Cheol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "John Metzner", "Rajeev Sharma", "James Kenneth Breakall", "John F Doherty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Rajeev Sharma, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Co-channel interference Management", "Time Division Duplex", "D-TDD", "Multimedia Traffic", "Time Slot Allocation", "Wireless Communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "effects of temperature and sustained loading on the response of FRP-strengthened concrete elements", "id": "23040", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10406", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) repair systems for concrete structures have been widely used in civil infrastructure. Concrete-epoxy interfaces (CEI) are formed during the installation of externally bonded FRP systems to concrete structures. Research on their short-term behavior under aggressive environmental conditions has been conducted extensively in the past. Nevertheless, long-term performance and durability issues of these strengthening systems still remain largely uncertain. Thus, it is critical to study the effects of sustained load and temperature on the time-dependent deformation of the concrete-epoxy interface along with the residual strength of the FRP-strengthened concrete element.\nSingle-lap shear and three-point bending test specimens were used to evaluate temperature effect and the time-dependent behavior during sustained loading below and at ultimate strength after the sustained loading period. The test results demonstrated the effects of temperature and sustained loading on creep behavior and on the remaining strength (the fracture energy) after creep duration. The creep responses of single-lap shear and three-point bending test specimens depend on the creep response of the epoxy. The effect of sustained loading on the remaining strength is positive for the single-lap shear specimens. However, this positive effect decreases as the creep duration increases. On the other hand, for the three-point bending test specimens, the sustained loading effect is negative on the remaining strength because presence of sustained loading leads to a weakening in the bond strength in the concrete-epoxy interface, which is evidenced by the fracture surface analysis of tested three-point bending specimens.\nResults of a numerical study of the single-lap shear specimens are also presented. Numerical models used the viscoelastic model for the creep tests and a plastic damage model for the bond tests. Results were compared with the available experimental results. The results show good correlations between the analysis and tests. It is proven that the creep behavior of the single-lap shear specimen is mainly governed by the creep characteristics of the epoxy. The numerical results also suggest that the redistributing of the interfacial bond stress can lead to an increase in the remaining strength of the single-lap shear specimens. A parametric study is carried out in order to investigate the various factors affecting creep behaviors and bond behaviors of single-lap shear specimens. Elevated temperatures and increased epoxy thicknesses lead to an increase in the remaining strength of the single-lap shear specimens due to stress redistribution occurring during the sustained loading period.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10069], "author_name_tesi": "Jeong, Yoseok ", "last_name_ssi": "Jeong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yoseok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy", "Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy", "Charles E Bakis", "Farshad Rajabipour", "Gordon Patrick Warn", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Farshad Rajabipour, Committee Member", "Gordon Patrick Warn, Committee Member", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FRP", "epoxy", "creep", "temperature", "sustained loading", "fracture energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Religion, Gender Equality, and Fertility", "id": "25018", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10837", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research on the relationships between religion, gender equality, and fertility is generally limited to one level of analysis and/or few empirical measures.

And third, how does religion mediate or moderate the institutional-level association between gender equality and fertility? In this dissertation I answer these questions using data for 56 countries from the 2000 wave of the World Values and European Values Surveys and several other data sources. \n\nIn Chapter 1 I introduce the dissertation and briefly discuss why religion, gender equality, and fertility matter for fertility. In Chapter 2 I describe the WVS/EVS, World Bank Development Indicators, Grim and Finke International Religious Freedom Indexes (Grim and Finke 2006), Fox Religion and State data (Fox 2011), and the Cingranelli and Richards Human Rights Data Project (Cingranelli and Richards 2010), highlighting the strengths of these data for illustrating religion, gender equality, and fertility relationships. I also discuss the analytic strategy used in each of the following three chapters. In Chapter 3 I use multiple measures for religious context and individual religiosity to determine the association between religion and fertility. I find that religious context and individual religiosity are associated with fertility and that individual-level relationships vary by context, but these associations are only significant for certain measures. In Chapter 4 I use measures for gender equality in both the public and private spheres at individual and country levels to investigate an association between gender equality and fertility. I conclude that the relationship between gender equality and fertility depends largely on the type of gender equality being measured. In Chapter 5 I demonstrate an association between gender equality and fertility, and I explore the ways that religion influences this association. I conclude that religion and gender inequality work together to influence fertility in some cases. Finally, in Chapter 6 I discuss how these findings advance our understanding of the relationships between religion, gender equality, and fertility, and I offer several suggestions for future research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10438], "author_name_tesi": "Jeppsen, Catherine E", "last_name_ssi": "Jeppsen", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Catherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke", "Melissa Hardy", "Jenny Trinitapoli", "Eric Plutzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Kent Finke, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Hardy, Dissertation Advisor", "Jenny Trinitapoli, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Religion", "gender", "fertility", "demography", "sociology", "context"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Impact of Adaptive Cruise Control on the Formation of Self-organized Traffic Jams on Highways\n", "id": "9665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3634", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the analysis of a potential control mechanism for self-organizing systems by studying the specific problem of self-organizing traffic jams.

The master equation approach is selected for developing a model that describes the self-organizing behavior of traffic flow at a mesoscopic scale. The master equation approach is further developed to incorporate driver (or agent) behavior. Control of the self-organizing system is presented via introduction of similar agents with slightly varying interaction properties. The introduction of such agents into a self-organizing system is considered to be analogous to the introduction of vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) into traffic flow. The behavior for both human-driven and ACC vehicles is modeled using the same driver model but with slightly different model parameters. It is found that introduction of a small percentage of agents with slightly different interaction behavior has the potential to affect the dynamics of the self-organizing system.

Specifically, the problem of ascertaining the influence of a set of agents on the ensemble dynamics is addressed through two complementary approaches. In the first approach, discussed in Part I of the dissertation, the ability to influence ensemble dynamics is studied as a function of changing agent population demographics. Statistical mechanics-inspired methodologies, such as the master equation and the generalized Ising model, are used to study the effect of introduction of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithms on the self-organized dynamics of traffic jams. Results indicate mixed positive and negative effects of introduction of ACC-equipped vehicles at various traffic densities.\n\nWhile this approach can help guide long-term intelligent vehicle deployment strategies on the time scale of years or decades, population demographic control is not a feasible solution for influencing large-scale multi-agent systems on the time scale of minutes or hours. Thus, the second approach, discussed in Part II of this dissertation, addresses the problem by identifying appropriate regions of the state space within which the control efforts exerted by a small set of agents can influence the self-organized dynamics of the ensemble. The methodologies adopted in this approach make use of the kinematic wave theory of traffic flow and the notion of controllability to present the novel concept of influential subspaces.

Therefore, the models by Bowring and Groeneveld were selected for SMR-160 safety analysis.\nThe Bowring model consists of a set of empirical equations. The Groeneveld model is in the form of a 15\u00d721\u00d723 multi-dimensional table of CHF values discretized in pressure, mass flux and equilibrium quality, along with several \u201cK\u201d factors adjusting for additional physical affects. These two models were implemented in CTF for CHF and DNB calculations of SMR-160.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11869], "author_name_tesi": "Jernigan, Caleb S", "last_name_ssi": "Jernigan", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Caleb", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["SMR-160", "CTF", "CHF", "Bowring", "Groeneveld", "EPRI-1", "W3", "Biasi", "DNB"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Fabrication of Anisotropic Multifunctional Colloidal Carriers", "id": "10979", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2172", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of colloidal assembly has grown tremendously in recent years, although the direct or template-assisted methods used to fabricate complex colloidal constructions from monodisperse micro- and nanoparticles have been generally demonstrated on model materials.  In this work, novel core particle syntheses, particle functionalizations and bottom-up assembly techniques are presented to create functional colloidal devices.\n\nUsing particle lithography, high-information colloidal vectors have been developed and modified with imaging and targeting agents.  Localized nanoscale patches have been reliably positioned on microparticles to serve as foundations for further chemical or physical modifications.  Site-specific placement of RGD targeting ligands has been achieved in these lithographed patches.  Preferential uptake of these targeted vectors by RGD-specific 3T3 fibroblasts was verified using confocal laser scanning microscopy.  \n\nA transition was made from the functionalization of model imaging core particles to the lithography of colloidal cartridges, in an effort to construct colloidal syringes with specialized, programmable release profiles. A variety of functional, pH-sensitive fluorescent cores were engineered to respond to solution conditions.  When triggered, the diverse composite core microparticles and reservoir microcapsules released embedded fluorescent moieties such as dye molecules, and fluorophore-conjugated nanoparticles. The microcapsules, created using layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte deposition on sacrificial templates, were selectively modified with a robust coating.  The pH-responsive anisotropic reservoir microcapsules were extremely stable in solution, and exhibited a \u201cLazarus\u201d functionality of rehydrating to their original state following desiccation.\n\nA snapshot of focused-release of core constituents through the lone opening in colloidal monotremes has been obtained by anisotropically-functionalizing degradable cores with barrier shells.  Additionally, lithographed patches have been designed to serve as nanoparticle launching pads to illustrate the behavior of released fluorescent tracer nanoparticles.  \n\nFinally, experience with electrostatics and nanoparticle coatings was translated to real-world applications by quickly developing and testing naturally-functionalized antimicrobial sand for water clarification. \n\nThis dissertation comprises many research areas including: colloidal assembly; site-specific functionalizations; polymer and metal particle syntheses and growth; mammalian cell and microbial culture; multilayered functionalizations with nanoparticles, fluorophores, polyelectrolytes, ionic initiators, biomolecules, proteins and bacteria.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2152], "author_name_tesi": "Jerri, Huda A.", "last_name_ssi": "Jerri", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Huda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol", "Darrell Velegol", "Seong H Kim", "Antonios Armaou", "Erwin A Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Chair", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["focused-release", "multifunctional particles", "particle lithography", "anisotropic microcapsules", "drug delivery vectors", "water clarification", "sacrificial template particles", "degradable cores", "core/shell particles", "barrier shells", "colloidal monotremes"]}]
