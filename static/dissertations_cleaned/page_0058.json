Hydrocephalus results from an excessive accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain, brain compression, and sometimes an increase in the intracranial pressure. It is believed that hydrocephalus is either caused by an increase in CSF production, or by an obstruction of the circulation of CSF or of the venous outflow system. The treatment is therefore based on CSF flow diversion. Given that the response of the patients who have been treated continues to be poor there is an urgent need to design better therapy protocols for hydrocephalus. Mathematical models of CSF dynamics and CSF-brain interactions could play important roles in the design of improved, patient-specific treatments. One of the first predictive mathematical models of CSF pressure-volume interactions was proposed by Marmarou in the 1970\u2019s and provides a theoretical basis for studying hydrocephalus. However, this model fails to fully capture the complexity of the CSF dynamics. In this thesis we will propose a generalization to Marmarou\u2019s model using fractional calculus. We use a modified Adomian decomposition method to solve analytically the proposed fractional order nonlinear differential equation. Our results show temporal multi-scaling behavior of CSF dynamics. In addition, we also propose a novel coupled-field model using Hamilton\u2019s principle to capture some of the dynamics taking place at the macroscopic and microscopic scales during the onset and evolution of hydrocephalus. Our coupled-field model introduces healing (growth) and inflammation (aging) states of the brain which show distinct temporal variations when we use experimentally measured volumetric data for healthy and hydrocephalic mice.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8449], "author_name_tesi": "Kauffman, Justin A", "last_name_ssi": "Kauffman", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrocephalus", "Mathematical Modeling", "Brain Biomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "An Overset Mesh Framework for the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method ", "id": "15005jak5378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15005", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Computational simulations contain discretizations of both a physical domain and a mathematical model. In this dissertation, an overset mesh framework is used to discretize the physical domain, and the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element method is used to discretize the mathematical model. It is proposed that using an overset mesh framework for the HDG method enables stable solutions to be computed for complex geometries and dynamic meshes. \n\nOverset mesh methods are chosen because they are efficient at decomposing geometrically complex domains. The HDG method was chosen because it provides solutions that are arbitrarily high-order accurate, reduces the size of the global discrete problem, and has the ability to solve elliptic, parabolic, and/or hyperbolic problems with a unified form of discretization. \n\nAn overset mesh method can utilize an inherent property of the HDG method, the decomposition of the solution into global (face) and local (volume) parts. The global solution exists only on the cell boundaries; while, the local solution exists in the interior of each cell and is decoupled between neighboring cells. This decomposition introduces face-volume coupling in the weak form for degrees of freedom on cell boundaries, which is used as the foundation for the overset communication between subdomains.\n\nUltimately, the goal of this work is to simulate full-scale hydrodynamic and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. To achieve these simulations, the necessary building blocks must first be verified and validated in the overset-HDG framework. The building blocks demonstrated in this dissertation are steady convection-diffusion, linear elasticostatics, and pseudo-compressible Navier-Stokes in both Eulerian and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian frames.

In chapter two, I review previous research examining sport ethics. Based on the limitations identified, including the inconsistent use of theoretical and operational definitions, reliability and validity\nissues in the measurement of moral behavior in sport, and the limited range of behaviors\nexamined, unsportspersonlike behavior is reconceptualized as an interpersonal construct\ndefined from its core aspects of harm, injustice, and violations of others\u2019 rights. Chapter three establishes the basis for classifying behaviors as unsportspersonlike or interpersonal. Drawing on philosophic theorizing and Interpersonal Theory, I detail three main points: (1) morality is interpersonal in nature; (2) sport competition is an interpersonal and a moral domain; and (3) unsportspersonlike behavior is interpersonal in\nnature and is inherently moral in nature. Through this, a variety of unsportspersonlike behaviors are organized around the major interpersonal characteristics of agency and communion. Chapter four examines the structure, validity, and interpersonal nature of the newly developed Scale of Unsportspersonlike Behavior (SUB). The underlying eight factor model with higher order factors representing interpersonal unsportspersonlike behavior is confirmed. Evidence of internal, convergent, concurrent, and discriminant validity is provided. Participant-based characteristics influenced the type of interpersonal unsportspersonlike behavior athletes engaged in. Men participating in sports with high levels of contact and athletes having longer sport experience reported more hostile-dominant behaviors. Women participating in non-contact sports, and competitors having\nlimited sport experience reported more submissive behaviors. Chapter reconfirms the structure and content validity of the SUB with an independent sample. Similar participant-related differences in hostile-dominant and hostile-submissive behaviors were also evident.

The first chapter is about\nimplications of tax reforms of 1980's on married females' labor\nforce participation. The Economic Recovery Act of 1981 and the Tax\nReform Act of 1986 changed the U.S. income tax structure in a\ndramatic fashion. These two reforms reduced the marginal tax rates\nfor married households. In this paper I build a heterogeneous agent\nmodel populated by married households. Households differ by age and\neducational attainment levels of their members and decide whether\nthe second earner, the wife, should participate in the market. I\nselect parameter values so that the model economy is consistent with\nthe 1980 U.S. economy in terms of income tax structure, wages (skill\npremium and gender gap), marital sorting (who is married with whom),\nand female labor force participation. In order to find the\ncontribution of tax reforms to the rise in married female labor\nforce participation, I simulate an economy with taxes of 1980 and\nallow wages and marital sorting take 1990 values. I show that about\n28% of the rise in married female labor force participation (from\n59% to 70%) between 1980 and 1990 can be accounted for by the\nchanges in the income tax structure.\n\nThe second chapter, written with Nezih Guner and Gustavo Ventura,\nstudies the aggregate implications of different tax reforms with a\nnew perspective. We develop a dynamic setup with heterogeneous\nmarried and single households, and with an operative extensive\nmargin in labor supply. We restrict our model with observations on\ngender and skill premia, labor force participation across skill\ngroups, and the structure of marital sorting. We then use this model\nto evaluate hypothetical reforms to the U.S. tax system. Replacing\ncurrent income taxes by a proportional consumption tax increases\nsteady-state output by about 10.5%. This increase is accompanied by\ndifferential effects on labor supply: while per-worker hours\nincrease by about 3.0%, the labor force participation of secondary\nearners increases by 4.6% and married females increase their total\nhours by 7.6%. Married females account for about 51% of the total\nincrease in labor hours. When current income taxes are replaced by a\nprogressive consumption tax, married females account for a much\nlarger (65.2%) share of the total increase in labor hours. Our\nresults also show that the extent of the labor force participation\nby secondary earners, the wage structure (gender gap and skill\npremia), as well as the composition of pool of married individuals\n(who is married with whom) in the pre-reform economy affect\naggregate outcomes in significant ways.\n\nThe final chapter studies the implications of two important rules of\nSocial Security System. The existing social security system in the\nU.S. has a special provision for married households: a spouse can\nchoose between own benefits and half of the spouse's benefits.\nAnother feature of the system is the progressive calculation of\nbenefits: benefits are determined by a concave function of past mean\nearnings. I develop an equilibrium life-cycle model to quantify the\naggregate, cross-sectional, and welfare implications of three\nalternatives: elimination of the spousal benefit, elimination of the\nprogressivity of benefits, and the two combined. Agents start out as\npermanently married or single and with education levels and wage\nprofiles, where the latter depend both on education and gender. The\nhousehold is the decision maker and decides on the labor supply of\nits member(s) and saving. The aggregate production function has as\ninputs capital and labor aggregated by efficiency. Eliminating the\nspousal benefit provision has substantial effects. The labor force\nparticipation of married women increases by 4.5% and households\ncomposed of men with relatively high education and women with\nrelatively low education experience significant welfare losses. When\nonly progressivity is eliminated, there is a decline in labor force\nparticipation of married females and households composed of men with\nrelatively high education and women with relatively low education\nexperience significant welfare gains. When both are eliminated, the\nlabor force participation of married women increases and households\ncomposed of two members with high education gain most. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5437], "author_name_tesi": "Kaygusuz, Remzi ", "last_name_ssi": "Kaygusuz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Remzi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward James Green", "Nezih Guner", "Gustavo Ventura", "Neil Wallace", "Emmanouil Galenianos", "Abdullah Yavas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward James Green, Committee Chair", "Nezih Guner, Committee Member", "Gustavo Ventura, Committee Member", "Neil Wallace, Committee Member", "Emmanouil Galenianos, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social security", "taxation", "labor force participation", "tax reform"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Parallelism-aware Resource Management Techniques for Many-core Architectures", "id": "26513", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11684", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "General-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) are at their best in accelerating computation by exploiting abundant thread-level parallelism (TLP) offered by many classes of high performance computing applications.

In this thesis, integration of microfabrication and acoustic actuation has been demonstrated in order to combine advantages of both techniques for biomedical engineering applications.       \nFirst, in situ fabricated and acoustically actuated microrotors are illustrated. A polymeric microrotor with sharp-edge structures is fabricated in situ by applying a patterned UV light to polymerize a photocrosslinkable polyethylene glycol solution inside a microchannel around an existing polydimethylsiloxane axle. To actuate the microrotors by oscillating the sharp-edge structures, we employ piezoelectric transducers which generate tunable acoustic waves. The resulting acoustic streaming flows rotate the microrotors. A 6-arm microrotor could exceed 1200 revolutions per minute. \nSecond, acoustic actuation of biologically mimicked and flagellated microswimmers is developed. Microswimmers are in situ fabricated by using UV light in a microchannel fulfilled with a photocrosslinkable solution. When acoustic waves are applied, the flagella of microswimmers oscillate, which, in turn, move them either rotationally or directionally depending on their design. The rotational and directional movements of these biologically mimicked microswimmers are tuned by pick-to-pick voltage through a transducer. A directional flagellated microswimmer could exceed a velocity of 1200 \u03bcm per second at 160 VPP, which is much faster than many biological counterparts such as bacteria, while rotational micrswimmers can exceed 200 RPM. Simple microfabrication as well as remote actuation via acoustic waves is promising for microapplications such as microdrilling, targeted drug delivery and microsurgery in biomedical, chemical and biological engineering.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12005], "author_name_tesi": "Kaynak, Murat ", "last_name_ssi": "Kaynak", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Murat", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Thesis Advisor", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustic", "in situ fabrication", "microrotor", "microswimmer", "microstructure", "flagella", "biomimicry"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Examining Children's Well-Being: Schooling and Child Labor in Nigeria", "id": "10556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "418", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 28 of this policy document, speaks to the importance of governments providing all children in their national entities with at least a free primary education. Article 28 also calls for the need for government to increase the regular school attendance and to decrease the school drop out rate of children in their respective countries. A free primary education is considered a right that every child has and it is the obligation of governments to meet this human rights goal. Nigeria, the country of interest in this dissertation, has set out to meet this human rights obligation through its Universal Basic Education (UBE) program, launched in 1999.\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child also discusses other issues that are relevant for children\u2019s well-being. One of the subjects of discussion is children\u2019s work. In the document, specifically in Article 32, it is stated that children should not be allowed to participate in any work that interferes with their education, health, and/or development. The premises within Article 32 call for governments to set the minimum age, minimum wage, hours, and conditions under which children can partake in any form of employment/work. Article 15 of the African Charter on the Rights of the Child and Welfare of the Child is framed in line with Article 32 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Conventions 182 and 138 in the policy document written by the International Labor Organization (ILO) also talk about children\u2019s employment/work. Convention 182 states that children must be banned from participating in any work that falls under the worst form of child labor or any work that affects their health, safety, and morals. Convention 138 on the other hand, set the minimum age in which they can begin to work. \nThis dissertation research has two main objectives. First, it investigates the role of gender, urban-rural residence, and household socioeconomic status play in creating inequality within children\u2019s schooling and work activities. It also examines the specific factors within gender, urban-rural residence, and socioeconomic status, which pose an obstacle to children\u2019s schooling and work. \nThe results in chapter five on schooling indicate that girls are the majority of children who have dropped out and who have never attended school. This finding in the Nigerian context is in line with previous research in sub-Saharan Africa that shows an existence of a gender disparity in children\u2019s schooling, which disadvantages girls. Evidence also shows that socioeconomic indicators are very important variables that affect children\u2019s likelihood of dropping out of school or never attending school in the first place. The mother\u2019s education at the incomplete secondary and/or complete secondary and higher education levels greatly increases the likelihood that children will be enrolled in school or has contact with a school. On the other hand, father\u2019s education, especially at the complete secondary and higher level helps to ensure that children complete their schooling. Household wealth, in particular at the richest quintile, also proves to be an important factor by increasing children\u2019s chances of attending school. Evidence shows that socioeconomic indicators are factors that can help to bring more children into school and keep them there. This shows that the household production framework as a theoretical explanation is relevant in the Nigerian case. Other factors which play a role in children\u2019s schooling are distance away from schools, religion, sibling composition, parental attitude towards child labor and gender inequality and region of residence. \nGender-specific models revealed that girls face greater obstacles to attending school when secondary schools are not available in their community; in addition, the likelihood of girls remaining in school declines if they reside in a household with infants and toddlers. Socioeconomic status-specific models showed that poor children have a greater risk than non-poor children of becoming a school dropout if secondary schools are not available in their communities. Finally, models estimated separately by rural versus urban residence indicated that in rural areas, males are less likely to become school dropouts than female children. In addition, rural children whose fathers have a complete secondary or higher education (compared to none) have a lower risk of dropping out of school than those whose father have no education. \nThe results of children\u2019s work engagement presented in chapter six depict that the majority of work being carried out among children in Nigeria is done by girls. There also exists an urban-rural and a socioeconomic disparity in children\u2019s work which disadvantages rural and poor children, respectively. Policy efforts to limit children\u2019s work should pay special attention to the work done by girls, rural children, and poor children. The poverty explanation for why children work is relevant in the context of Nigeria. Other important factors for deterring children\u2019s work are mother\u2019s and father\u2019s education, in particular at the complete secondary and higher level. However, living twenty or more minutes from a primary school and/or having parents who are in favor of child labor are factors that increase children\u2019s work engagement. \nThe gender-specific model shows that girls\u2019 work engagement declines as household wealth increases. The residence-specific model indicates the work engagement of rural children decreases when they have mothers who have an incomplete secondary or higher education level. In addition, higher household socioeconomic status is associated with lower prevalence of work among rural children. Any attempt to reduce the work responsibilities of girls and rural children must focus on improving the household income level. The socioeconomic specific model shows that poor children\u2019s work engagement rises when they reside in households with infants and toddlers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [412], "author_name_tesi": "Kazeem, Aramide  ", "last_name_ssi": "Kazeem", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aramide ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leif Jensen", "Leif Jensen", "C Shannon Stokes", "Diane K Mc Laughlin", "David Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leif Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Leif Jensen, Committee Chair", "C Shannon Stokes, Committee Chair", "Diane K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "David Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["schooling", "education", "child labor", "sub-Saharan Africa", "education and Nigeria", "Child labor and Nigeria", "Education and Child labor and sub-Saharan Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving the Performance Profile of Energy Conservation Measures at the Penn State University Park Campus", "id": "25943", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11488", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conducting energy conservation measures (ECM) in campus buildings is one of the significant steps taken by the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) to contribute to its energy costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals.

Under catabolic conditions such as sepsis and glucocorticoid excess, there is an increase in total DEPTOR protein and a reduction in phosphorylation of PRAS40, suggesting that these proteins may modulate the mTOR-mediated protein synthetic response under normal and diseased conditions.  The hypothesis of the present study was that knock down (KD) of PRAS40 or DEPTOR in C2C12 myocytes will increase protein synthesis via stimulating mTOR-S6K1 signaling.  PRAS40 and DEPTOR KD was achieved using lentiviral particles containing shRNA to target the mouse PRAS40 and DEPTOR mRNA sequence, whereas control cells were transfected with a scrambled control shRNA.  KD reduced PRAS40 and DEPTOR mRNA and protein content by 90%.  PRAS40 KD did not result in increased phosphorylation of mTOR substrates or increased protein synthesis, whereas, DEPTOR KD increased both phosphorylation of mTOR kinase substrates, 4E-BP1 and S6K1, and protein synthesis.  The responsiveness of PRAS40 and DEPTOR KD myocytes to anabolic (IGF-I) and catabolic (AICAR) stimuli was unaltered.  Both PRAS40 and DEPTOR KD myoblasts were larger in diameter and exhibited an increased mean cell volume compared to scramble control.  PRAS40 KD cells had decreased phosphorylation (S807/S811) of pRb protein.  In contrast, DEPTOR KD cells had an increased phosphorylation (S807/S811) of pRb protein which is critical for the G1-S phase transition, coincident with an increased percentage of cells in the S phase.  Neither PRAS40 nor DEPTOR KD altered myoblast apoptosis as evidenced by the lack of change for cleaved caspase-3.  Although DEPTOR KD myoblasts did not alter autophagy as determined by a lack of change in the ratio of LC3BII/LC3BI, PRAS40 KD myoblasts had a reduced ratio of LC3BII/LC3BI.  While PRAS40 KD delayed myotube formation concurrent with delayed proliferation, DEPTOR KD had the opposite effect on myogenesis and proliferation.  Finally, while in vivo DEPTOR KD (~50% reduction) by electroporation into the muscle of C57/BL6 mice did not alter weight or protein synthesis in the control muscle, it prevented atrophy produced by 3 days of hindlimb immobilization, at least in part by increasing protein synthesis.  Thus, our data support the hypothesis that PRAS40 and DEPTOR are important regulators of protein metabolism in myocytes and demonstrate that, while PRAS40 is required for normal myoblast growth and function, decreasing DEPTOR expression is sufficient to ameliorate the atrophic response produced by immobilization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10], "author_name_tesi": "Kazi, Abid A", "last_name_ssi": "Kazi", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Abid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles H Lang", "Charles H Lang", "Scot R Kimball", "Lisa M Shantz", "Timothy M Ritty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles H Lang, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Timothy M Ritty, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein synthesis", "mTOR", "knockdown", "lentivirus", "shRNA", "sepsis", "disuse atrophy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Analysis of the Dynamic Response of Suspension Footbridges Measured Against Human Comfort Criteria", "id": "24987", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11075", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many rural communities around the world become isolated from their basic needs during the rainy season, so pedestrian suspension bridges are being built to provide hundreds of thousands of people with basic access.

The purpose was to provide a greater understanding of how this experience may contribute to faculty conceptions of teaching, classroom practices, and professional growth. The study used a survey and interviews to collect qualitative data from instructors who taught both online and face-to-face in a traditional face-to-face institution. Data were analyzed using a hermeneutical phenomenology approach.\n\nSix overarching themes emerged: 1) Reflecting on Practice, 2) Creating Structure, 3) Promoting Active Learning, 4) Encouraging Peer Interaction, 5) Establishing a Connection, and 6) Conducting the Class. Reflecting on Practice occurs when instructors question themselves about their teaching goals and objectives. Creating Structure refers to course planning and designing. Promoting Active Learning reflects instructors\u2019 ongoing consideration of how to promote deep student engagement with course content. Encouraging Peer Interaction focuses on creating opportunities for students to interact with one another as a means of social learning. Establishing a Connection describes instructors\u2019 attempts to connect personally with students. Conducting the Class refers to the ongoing consideration of maximizing class time for student learning.\n\nThree meta-themes were introduced to explain additional influences on the change processes described by the research participants.

Understanding how anesthetics produce their numerous cellular effects will facilitate the design of safer anesthetics with fewer undesirable side effects.  The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is being used as a model to elucidate anesthetic actions.  Studies in yeast show that availability of specific amino acids plays a key role in the response of this organism to anesthetics.  The volatile anesthetic isoflurane inhibits the uptake of leucine and tryptophan, inducing a starvation response and growth arrest in appropriately auxotrophic strains.  Overexpression of TAT1, TAT2, or BAP2 genes encoding permeases that import these amino acids, renders such strains resistant to volatile anesthetics.  Conversely, deletion of these genes leads to increased sensitivity to anesthetics.  These findings implicate specific amino acid permeases as candidate targets of anesthetics.  \nThe high-affinity tryptophan transporter Tat2p, which is encoded by TAT2, was inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner during isoflurane exposure.  This inhibition was rapid and reversible.  Amino acid uptake studies revealed that the inhibition of Tat2p by isoflurane was not competitive, suggesting that anesthetics do not affect the ability of Tat2p to bind tryptophan. Inhibition of transport was not due to degradation or this permease or relocalization away from the plasma membrane.  These findings are consistent with a model where isoflurane decreases Tat2p transporter activity, either through a direct interaction or a membrane-mediated effect.  \nMutations within TAT2 that render cells resistant to isoflurane were isolated.  Characterization of these mutants revealed that anesthetic resistance can result from an overall increase in tryptophan uptake in the presence and absence of drug, a decrease in the inhibitory effects of anesthetic on uptake, or a combination of these two factors.  \nTat2p provides a model of anesthetic effects on a candidate drug target in a single-celled organism.  A better understanding of the effects of volatile anesthetics on amino acid permeases will provide insight into the mechanisms of action of these clinically essential drugs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4677], "author_name_tesi": "Keasey, Nikki R", "last_name_ssi": "Keasey", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Nikki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph Lauren Keil", "Jong Kak Yun", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Laura Carrel", "Ross Shiman", "Scot R Kimball"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Ross Shiman, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["yeast", "volatile anesthetics", "nutrient transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "exploiting memory remnant vulnerabilities to do cross-tenant data extraction in cloud systems", "id": "15493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the recent innovations in providing third-party support for processing needs is cloud computing.

Accordingly, it is highly manufacturable, low power, and suitable for integration into sensor arrays. The nanosensor is based on electrical resistivity changes that arise upon adsorption of mercury onto gold surfaces. We demonstrate the advantages of the nanoscale design for this application and substantiate its use for other chemical detection applications.

However, fundamental limits in the device physics were reached ~2003, halting further reductions in clock speed without significant penalties in power consumption. This has motivated the research into next generation transistors and switching devices to reinstate the scaling laws for clock speed. This dissertation aims to support the scaling of devices that are based on ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity and to provide a roadmap for the corresponding materials performance. \nFirst, a scalable growth process to obtain highly {001}-oriented lead magnesium niobate \u2013 lead titanate (PMN-PT) thin films was developed, motivated by the high piezoelectric responses observed in bulk single crystals. It was found that deposition of a 2-3 nm thick PbO buffer layer on {111} Pt thin film bottom electrodes, prior to chemical solution deposition of PMN-PT reduces the driving force for Pb diffusion from the PMN-PT to the bottom electrode, and facilitates nucleation of {001}-oriented perovskite grains. Energy dispersive spectroscopy demonstrated that up to 10% of the Pb from a PMN-PT precursor solution may diffuse into the bottom electrode. PMN-PT grains with a mixed {101}/{111} orientation in a matrix of Pb-deficient pyrochlore phase were then promoted near the interface. When this is prevented, phase pure films with {001} orientation with Lotgering factors of 0.98-1.0, can be achieved. The resulting films of only 300 nm in thickness exhibit longitudinal effective d33,f coefficients of ~90 pm/V and strain values of ~1% prior to breakdown. \n300 nm thick epitaxial and polycrystalline lead magnesium niobate \u2013 lead titanate (70PMN-30PT) blanket thin films were studied for the relative contributions to property thickness dependence from interfacial and grain boundary low permittivity layers. Epitaxial PMN-PT films were grown on SrRuO3 /(001)SrTiO3, while polycrystalline films with {001}-Lotgering factors >0.96 were grown on Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrates via chemical solution deposition. It was found that both film types exhibited similar, thickness-independent high-field \u03b5r of ~300 with highly crystalline electrode/dielectric interfaces. The dielectric data suggest that irreversible domain wall motion is the major contributor to the overall dielectric response and its thickness dependence. In epitaxial films the irreversible Rayleigh coefficients reduced 85% upon decreasing thickness from 350 to 100 nm. Tmax was the only measured small signal quantity which was more thickness dependent in polycrystalline than epitaxial films. This was attributed to the relaxor nature present in the films, potentially stabilized by defect concentrations, and/or chemical inhomogeneity. The effective interfacial layers are found to contribute to the measured thickness dependence in d33,f measured by X-ray diffraction. Finally, high field piezoelectric characterization revealed a field-induced rhombohedral to tetragonal phase transition in epitaxial films.\nWhile the mechanisms causing thickness dependence are mostly understood, the functional properties of blanket PMN-PT films remain about an order of magnitude lower than what is achieved in constraint-free bulk single crystals. These property reductions are attributed to substrate clamping, and the process of declamping via lateral subdivision was studied in 300-350 nm thick, {001} oriented 70PMN-30PT films on Si substrates. In the clamped state, the films exhibit relative permittivity near 1500 and loss tangents of approximately 0.01. The films showed slim hysteresis loops with remanent polarizations of about 8 \u03bcC/cm2 and breakdown fields over 1500 kV/cm. Using optical and electron beam lithography combined with reactive ion etching, the PMN-PT films were systematically patterned down to lateral feature sizes of 200 nm in spatial scale with nearly vertical sidewalls. Upon lateral scaling, which produced partially declamped films, there was an increase in both small and large signal dielectric properties, including a doubling of the relative permittivity in structures with width-to-thickness aspect ratios of 0.7.  In addition, declamping resulted in a counterclockwise rotation of the hysteresis loops, increasing the remanent polarization to 13.5 \u03bcC/cm2.  Rayleigh analysis, Preisach modeling, and the relative permittivity as a function of temperature also indicated changes in the domain wall motion and intrinsic response of the laterally scaled PMN-PT.\nThe longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d33,f, was interrogated as a function of position across the patterned structures by finite element modeling, piezoresponse force microscopy, and nanoprobe synchrotron X-ray diffraction. It was found that d33,f increased from the clamped value of 40-50 pm/V to ~160 pm/V at the free sidewall under 200 kV/cm excitation. The sidewalls partially declamped the piezoelectric response 500-600 nm into the patterned structure, raising the piezoelectric response at the center of features with lateral dimensions less than 1 \u03bcm (3:1 width to thickness aspect ratio). The normalized data from all three characterization techniques are in excellent agreement, with quantitative differences providing insight to the field dependence of the piezoelectric coefficient and its declamping behavior.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12906], "author_name_tesi": "Keech, Ryan Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Keech", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Thomas R Shrout", "Mehdi Kiani", "Glenn Martyna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Mehdi Kiani, Outside Member", "Glenn Martyna, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ferroelectric", "piezoelectric", "thin films", "nanotechnology", "patterning", "logic device", "materials science", "perovskite", "PMN-PT", "declamping", "lead magnesium niobate lead titanate", "scaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS OF SP2 AND SP3 CARBON MATERIALS", "id": "13339duk164", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13339", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Carbon is the backbone of hundreds of products ranging from conductors to insulators and lubricants to machining tools. Diamond is the hardest material known and graphite is one of the softest, but there is a need for materials in between these two extremes. By taking advantage of the different pressure-dependent thermodynamic stabilities of graphite and diamond, the degree of sp2 and sp3 bonding in amorphous carbon materials can be varied. This control over bonding opens avenues for tuning properties such as electrical conductivity, hardness, and optical transmission. Two approaches to controlling sp3 and sp2 carbon formation have been studied. The first investigates techniques to deposit carbon at elevated pressures by high-pressure chemical vapor deposition. The second group of experiments involves high pressure synthesis techniques using a diamond anvil cell and developing precursors that will react at lower temperatures and pressures to give materials with sought after properties. This report is an investigation of the effect of high-pressure on the formation of amorphous carbon materials deposited by high-pressure chemical vapor deposition, dielectric breakdown plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, and laser induced plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. This report describes novel deposition and growth techniques such as high-pressure CVD of sp2 carbon wires in microcapillaries, with preliminary results showing increased sp3 bonding with the formation of a hydrogenated carbon material via plasma enhanced depositions. The second method approaches the tuning of sp2 and sp3 hybridization of carbon from the other direction of taking high pressure synthesis techniques and develop initial precursors that react at lower pressures forming an sp3 interconnected network. With pressure, amorphous carbons can also be made by compressing materials to the point where it is favorable for atoms to form new bonds.  My focus is on developing a precursor that will react at lower pressure and temperatures than current fabrication techniques for forming ultra-hard materials such as diamond and cubic boron nitride. We have investigated precursors with highly unsaturated groups like cyanides and acetylenes because they have the potential to form new bonds. We have characterized these compounds with in situ Raman, IR, and XRD to track structural changes. Three different precursors have been studied to understand the effect of the starting structure on the reactivity and sp2/sp3 nature.

However, areas that experience low levels of hunting effort and deer harvest may serve as de facto refugia where such regulation changes could have little influence on deer densities.  Knowledge of spatial variation in deer harvest and hunter distribution may help managers direct hunting effort to more effectively regulate deer densities.  \n\nI captured, collared, and monitored 231 antlerless white-tailed deer from 2005 to 2006 surrounding the Sproul State Forest in north-central Pennsylvania and the Tuscarora State Forest in south-central Pennsylvania.  I monitored deer on a weekly basis to estimate annual survival and harvest rates and to model spatial distribution of hunting mortality.  I conducted aerial surveys of hunters during the 12-day rifle hunting seasons in 2005 and 2006 on these same areas to estimate hunter density and to model hunter distribution.  I compared the distributions of hunters and hunting mortality to identify spatial variation in hunting efficiency.  Lastly, I used these models to predict the effect of an expanded road network on hunting mortality and refugia.\n\nPoint estimates indicated that on the Sproul study area, annual survival was greater on public land (89.9%, 95% CI = 84.0-96.1%) than private land (75.5%, 95% CI = 66.7-85.6%), but was the opposite on the Tuscarora study area (60.9%, 95% CI = 49.4-75.2% on public land and 75.5%, 95% CI = 66.7-85.6% on private land).  Point estimates indicated harvest rates on the Sproul study area were almost four times greater on private land (16.7%, 95% CI = 8.4-33.2%) than on public land (4.4%, 95% CI = 1.8-10.8%).  On the Tuscarora study area, harvest rate did not vary between public and private land, but point estimates indicate subadults were harvested at almost twice the rate (30.3%, 95% CI = 19.0-48.1%) as adults (16.4%, 95% CI = 9.4-28.6%).  The high survival and low harvest rates on public lands in the Sproul study area suggest that hunting may have a limited effect on deer population dynamics.\n\nHunter density on both study areas was greatest early in the hunting season.  On the Sproul study area, a maximum hunter density of 1.1 hunters/km2 was observed on both public and private land during opening day of the rifle season.  Hunter densities on public portions of Tuscarora study area ranged from 0.9-1.2 hunters/km2 over the first two days of the rifle season.  Hunter density on Tuscarora\u2019s private lands was lower, with a maximum hunter density of 0.5 hunters/km2 observed on opening morning.  \n\nOn both the Sproul and Tuscarora study areas, hunter use generally declined with increasing distance from the nearest public road and with increasing slope of the landscape.  On the Sproul study area, 73% of hunters on public land were located <600 m from a road, compared to 60% of the area being within that distance and 70% of hunters used slopes <8\u00b0, which represented 57% of the area.  Hunters on private lands on the Sproul study area were uniformly distributed by distance from road, but 79% of hunters were on slopes <8\u00b0, which represented 73% of the area.  On the Tuscarora study area, 79% of all public land hunters remained <600 m from a road, compared to 69% of the area being within that distance, and hunters tended to avoid steeper slopes, although the effect was not as great as on the Sproul study area.  Hunters on private land in the Tuscarora study area avoided locations both near and far from roads and slope had little relation to the distribution of hunters.  \n\nI found no spatial variation in deer hunting mortality rate on the Tuscarora study area.  On the Sproul study area, hunting mortality was highest close to roads, likely because hunter use was concentrated in those areas.  On public land, 74% of all hunting mortality occurred <500 m from a road, although only 53% of the area was within that distance.  On private land, 87% of all hunting mortality occurred <500 m from a road, compared to 74% of the area being within that distance category.  Slope of the landscape, however, had little influence on deer hunting mortality.\n\nHunting efficiency was not uniform across the landscape, indicating deer were more vulnerable to harvest in some areas, regardless of hunting pressure.  Hunters were most efficient 500\u20131,000 m from a road and on moderate slopes between 10 and 20 degrees.  Hunting efficiency also increased with increasing hunter use, except in areas of greatest use. \n\nThe Sproul study area contained >4,000 ha of de facto refugia that experienced hunting mortality rates of <2%, and increased opportunities for hunters to harvest antlerless deer may have little effect on deer densities in these areas.  Increasing hunter access to refugia may be an effective way to control local deer populations and expanding the public road network to include all gated and unimproved roads could potentially decrease the amount of refugia by 67%.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4359], "author_name_tesi": "Keenan, Matthew Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Keenan", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach", "Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor", "Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["harvest", "hunter density", "hunter distribution", "hunting efficiency", "hunting mortality", "Odocoileus virginianus", "Pennsylvania", "survival", "white-tailed deer", "antlerless"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Agronomic Performance of a Reduced-tillage Grain Crop Rotation During the Transition to Organic Production", "id": "26374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cover crop-based organic rotational no-till is one strategy for reducing tillage in organic systems and relies on rolled cover crop mulches to substitute for spring tillage and mechanical weed control in summer annual crops.  This experiment was conducted at three locations to test if delaying cover crop termination would increase biomass production, weed suppression, and corn and soybean yields during the three-year transition to certified organic production.  Three cover crop termination timings/ cash crop planting date treatments were examined in corn and soybean (Early, Middle, and Late).  Additional split- and split-split plots within the planting date treatments were the presence or absence of high-residue cultivation and cash crop variety selection, respectively.  The crop rotation was hairy vetch plus triticale cover crop-corn-cereal rye cover crop-soybean-winter wheat and was implemented in a full-entry design with all cash crops present in each year.  Hairy vetch-triticale biomass did not consistently increase with delayed termination, and Late termination corresponding to full flower and the onset of pod formation in hairy vetch was necessary to prevent hairy vetch from competing with corn and becoming a weed.  Cereal rye biomass increased as termination was delayed, but the Middle termination date corresponding to 50% anthesis to early milk was optimal for minimizing cereal rye competition with soybean and seed production.  Volunteer cover crops negatively impacted winter wheat at two sites: hairy vetch at Maryland and cereal rye at Pennsylvania.  Delaying planting tended to reduce corn but not soybean yields across sites.  Regression stability analysis identified the Middle planting date as minimizing the variability of corn and soybean yields.  These findings suggest that a tradeoff between hairy vetch control and corn yield cannot be avoided in this system while a tradeoff is not likely in cereal rye-soybean.\nPulse-chase additions of three summer annual weed species identified high-residue cultivation as an effective weed control tactic in cover crop-based organic rotational no-till.  Delaying cover crop termination and cash crop planting date did not have a clear impact on the target weeds across sites.  Later-emerging species giant foxtail and smooth pigweed appeared to more readily exploit low cash crop populations at later planting dates than the early-emerging common ragweed.  Yellow nut-sedge, a perennial species not included in the pulse-chase experiment, increased during the experiment across sites.\nIn a separate experiment examining the timing and frequency of high-residue cultivation in a conventional conservation tillage system, two high-residue cultivator passes plus banded herbicide at planting resulted in weed control and yields similar to weed-free check plots in corn and soybean.

After the second day of scouring, xylose (0.5 g/kg of BW) was administered orally once and blood was taken before administration for a baseline as well as 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post-dosing.

Growth parameters and plasma concentrations of glucose, BUN, creatinine and IgG were not different between treatments.  There were also no treatment effects on fecal dry matters and concentrations of fecal bacteria.  Intestinal parameters, including morphology, enzyme activities, DNA and protein concentrations were not significantly affected by nucleotide supplementation.  Calves supplemented with purified nucleotides had higher hematocrits, higher bacterial concentrations of Clostridium in feces and similar xylose absorption to control calves.  Calves supplemented with yeast-derived nucleotides had increased xylose uptake 4 hours after dosing, highest Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria concentrations in feces but a higher ratio of BUN to creatinine indicating higher dehydration.  Dietary supplementation of nucleotides did not appear to enhance any growth, health or metabolic parameters in this model.  More research needs to be conducted to investigate optimal concentrations of supplemented nucleotides as well as method and time of administration.\nNeonatal calf diarrhea is a persistent problem on dairy farms.  Education for improved colostrum management and feeding needs to be developed and consistently presented to producers to improve calf health and management.  More research also needs to be conducted to determine optimal levels and methods of feeding of nucleotides in order to decrease calf morbidity and mortality in the first weeks of life. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5601], "author_name_tesi": "Kehoe, Sylvia Inga", "last_name_ssi": "Kehoe", "middle_name_ssi": "Inga", "first_name_ssi": "Sylvia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Craig Richard Baumrucker", "Chad Daniel Dechow", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Gabriella Anne Varga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Craig Richard Baumrucker, Committee Member", "Chad Daniel Dechow, Committee Member", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Member", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nucleotides", "calves", "colostrum"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Optimal Periodic Control with Applications to Drug Delivery and High Altitude Wind Energy Generators", "id": "27163", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11944", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents two optimal periodic control algorithms and applies the algorithms to two applications: (i) drug delivery and (ii) airborne wind energy generators.  In certain so-called ``proper\" applications (including the two explored in this thesis), operating a plant periodically can be more beneficial than operating in steady state.  This thesis focuses on adapting the input trajectory of proper systems online in the presence of uncertainties.\n\nOnline strategies certainly exist in the in optimal periodic control literature, and some have even been applied to the drug delivery problem or to airborne wind energy generators. However, the body of literature concerning plants with uncertainties is more narrow.  The first method presented in this thesis uses a model-free extremum seeking scheme to slowly converge to the optimal periodic input trajectory.  The second method uses knowledge of the model but accounts for a parametric uncertainty, and extremum seeking is used to search through a family of optimal trajectories (computed offline) that correspond to discrete values of the uncertain parameter.  The specific design of each controller is novel (to the best of the author's knowledge).  It differs from other strategies in its combined focus on uncertainties and use of extremum seeking.  Extremum seeking is particularly well-suited for this task because of its ability to adapt to uncertainties and because of its well understood stability properties.\n\nThe first method, which is completely model-free, is applied to the drug delivery problem.  The drug delivery problem describes nicotine's interaction with the body.  Concentrations of nicotine instigate a tolerance effect, which lowers the overall drug efficacy.  By using the first model-free method, an optimal trajectory similar to others presented in the literature is achieved, but the convergence time is very slow (approximately 20,000 cycles).\n\nThe second method, which uses the model but accounts for a parametric uncertainty, is applied to an airborne wind energy generator.  The objective is to maximize the time-averaged power output in uncertain wind conditions.  The system's optimal energy output often involves flying in periodic figure-8 trajectories, but the precise optimal figure-8 shape is sensitive to environmental conditions, including wind speed.  The presented controller is efficient in that it only searches for the optimum trajectory over the uncertain parameter (in this paper, wind speed).

There is a complex and changing mixture of cytokines at the sites of inflammation during every stage of the inflammatory process, from initiation to resolution.  Proteases can influence the inflammatory response by altering cytokine bio-activity, either through inactivating the cytokine via degradation or activating the cytokine by converting the cytokine from a \u201cpro\u201d form to an active form.  \n   Meprins are zinc metalloproteinases of the metzincin superfamily that are comprised of \u03b1 and/or \u03b2 subunits that interact with each other to form unique membrane-bound and secreted isoforms.  Meprins are expressed in the brush-border membranes of kidney and intestinal epithelial cells along with the epidermal layers of the skin and certain populations of leukocytes.  The meprin metalloproteinases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases.  It is hypothesized that one mechanism by which meprins modulate and regulate inflammation is by direct proteolytic action on pericellular inflammatory mediators such as cytokines.  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an important pro-inflammatory mediator and several lines of in vivo data indicate that IL-6 is an in vivo substrate for meprins.  The current work focused mainly on characterizing the interaction between meprins and interleukin-6, with the hypothesis that meprins cleave and bio-inactivate IL-6. \n    This work demonstrates that the homomeric isoforms of meprin A and B cleave IL-6 at the C-terminus and remove a five amino acid segment, thereby inactivating the cytokine. Both the homomeric human meprin isoforms and the rodent meprin isoforms cleave human and mouse isoforms of IL-6, thereby decreasing the bio-activity of IL-6.  Furthermore, IL-6 inactivated by meprin A or B does not act in an antagonistic manner towards intact IL-6. The homomeric rodent meprin A and B isoforms of meprins cleave human IL-6 with high affinity (apparent) (Km) and efficiency (kcat/Km) values; 4.9 \u00b5M and 0.20 \u00b5M-1s-1, and 12.0 \u00b5M and 2.5 \u00b5M-1s-1 for meprin A and B, respectively. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cells transiently transfected with meprin \u03b2 and transfected with either meprin \u03b2 or meprin \u03b1 constructs cleave human IL-6.  The kinetics of meprin cleavage of IL-6 and the finding that meprins cleave IL-6 in a cell-based system indicate that IL-6 is a good substrate for both meprin A and B and provide a kinetics-based rationale for proposing that meprins are capable of cleaving IL-6 in vivo.  \n     While evaluating the interaction between meprins and IL-6 was the main aim of this thesis work, another aim was to study the interaction of endogenous inhibitors with meprins.  Endogenous proteinase inhibitors, such as alpha-2-macroglobulin and Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs), are important for the regulation of some protease activity in vivo, however, they do not inhibit meprin activity.  It has been proposed that mannose binding lectin (MBL), which is also located at sites of inflammation along with meprins, inhibits meprin activity.  Therefore, the interaction between MBL and meprins were studied further.  It was found that while MBL did not significantly inhibit meprin peptidase or proteinase activity, the interaction between the glycans of meprin and MBL was confirmed.  This interaction between meprins and MBL may have significance in vivo, as MBL recognition of meprins anchored to epithelial cells during inflammation may contribute to overall tissue damage via complement activiation.  \n     Wound healing is a complex inflammatory process that involves several factors including IL-6 and MBL.  Furthermore, diabetic patients have compromised and impaired wound healing. It is known that diabetic mice have down-regulated meprin expression.   Pilot studies with wound healing exudates from humans were initialed in order to determine a potential role of meprins in the process of wound healing.  While no correlation was discovered between meprin presence and the diabetic status of the patient from which the wound samples were taken, meprin alpha and beta subunits were located in human wound healing exudates from both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.  \n     This thesis expands the knowledge of the interaction between meprins and IL-6 and proposes a mechanism of meprin-mediated modulation of inflammation via direct proteolysis of inflammatory mediators.  This body of work also further describes the interaction of meprins and MBL and provides an impetus for studying meprins in the context of other inflammatory processes such as in complement-mediated cell damage and wound healing. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6268], "author_name_tesi": "Keiffer, Timothy ", "last_name_ssi": "Keiffer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith S Bond", "Judith S Bond", "Channe D Gowda", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Gavin Peter Robertson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith S Bond, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith S Bond, Committee Chair", "Channe D Gowda, Committee Member", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Meprin", "Interleukin-6", "Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "Mannose Binding Lectin", "Wound Healing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "NANOPARTICLE BIOCONJUGATES AS \u201cBOTTOM-UP\u201d ASSEMBLIES OF ARTIFICAL MULTIENZYME COMPLEXES\n", "id": "11587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2623", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The sequential enzymes of several metabolic pathways have been shown to exist in close proximity with each other in the living cell. Although not proven in all cases, colocalization may have several implications for the rate of metabolite formation. \nProximity between the sequential enzymes of a metabolic pathway has been proposed to have several benefits for the overall rate of metabolite formation. These include reduced diffusion distance for intermediates, sequestering of intermediates from competing pathways and the cytoplasm. Restricted diffusion in the vicinity of an enzyme can also cause the pooling of metabolites, which can alter reaction equilibria to control the rate of reaction through inhibition. \nAssociations of metabolic enzymes are difficult to isolate ex vivo due to the weak interactions believed to colocalize sequential  enzymes within the cell.  Therefore model systems in which the proximity and diffusion of intermediates within the experiment system are controlled are attractive alternatives to explore the effects of colocalization of sequential enzymes. To this end three model systems for multienzyme complexes have been constructed. \nDirect adsorption enzyme:gold nanoparticle bioconjugates functionalized with malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS) allow for proximity between to the enzymes to be controlled from the nanometer to micron range. Results show that while the enzymes present in the  colocalized and non-colocalized systems compared here behaved differently overall the sequential activity of the pathway was improved by (1) decreasing the diffusion distance between active sites, (2) decreasing the diffusion coefficient of the reaction intermediate to prevent escape into the bulk solution, and (3) decreasing the overall amount of bioconjugate in the solution to prevent the pathway from being inhibited by the buildup of metabolite over time. \nLayer-by-layer (L\u00acBL) assemblies of MDH and CS were used to examine the layering effect of sequential enzymes found in multienzyme complexes such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). By controlling the orientation of enzymes in the complex (i.e. how deeply embedded each enzyme is) it was hypothesized that differences in sequential activity would determine an optimal orientation for a multienzyme complex. It was determined during the course of these experiments that the polyelectrolyte (PE) assembly itself served to slow diffusion of intermediates, leading to a buildup of oxaloacetate within the PE layers to form a pool of metabolite that equalized the rate of sequential reaction between the different orientations tested. \nHexahistidine tag \u2013 Ni(II) nitriliotriacetic acid (NTA) chemistry is an attractive method to control the proximity between sequential enzymes because each enzyme can be bound in a specific orientation, with minimal loss of activity, and the interaction is reversible. Modifying gold nanoparticles or large unilamellar vesicles with this functionality allows for another class of model to be constructed in which proximity between enzymes is dynamic. Some metabolic pathways (such as the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway), have demonstrated dynamic proximity of sequential enzymes in response to specific cellular stimuli. Results indicate that Ni(II)NTA scaffolds immobilize histidine-tagged enzymes non-destructively, with a near 100% reversibility. This model can be used to demonstrate the possible implications of dynamic proximity such as pathway regulation. \nInsight into the benefits and mechanisms of sequential enzyme colocalization can enhance the general understanding of cellular processes, as well as allow for the development of new and innovative ways to modulate pathway activity. This may provide new designs for treatments of metabolic diseases and cancer, where metabolic pathways are altered. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2616], "author_name_tesi": "Keighron, Jacqueline D", "last_name_ssi": "Keighron", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Jacqueline", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Philip C.

Low production costs and high nutritional value are the main reasons behind the popularity of poultry products. However, during processing, poultry carcasses are unavoidably exposed to bacterial contamination due to large bacterial load of the birds. Contamination risk of poultry increases with larger numbers of the birds and amount of poultry undergoing processing. \nPulsed ultraviolet (UV)-light is an FDA-approved novel technology, which has the potential to inactivate microorganisms on food surfaces. The effectiveness of pulsed UV-light on microorganisms has been demonstrated by many researchers. Being a non-chemical, non-ionizing, and non-thermal (for short treatment time) process, pulsed UV-light may be a better alternative to decontaminate raw and/or minimally processed foods. Therefore, the efficacy of pulsed UV-light as a decontamination method for fresh poultry carcasses and products was evaluated in this research.   \nFirstly, the effectiveness of pulsed UV-light was investigated for the surface decontamination of raw boneless chicken breast. The top surfaces of chicken breast samples were inoculated with an antibiotic-resistant strain of Salmonella Typhimurium. The artificially contaminated chicken breasts were then vacuum-packaged or remained unpackaged. Each unpackaged or vacuum-packaged sample was treated with pulsed UV-light for 5, 15, 30, 45, or 60 s at 5, 8, or 13 cm distance from the quartz window in a pulsed UV-light chamber. An input voltage of 3800 V and three pulses per second generated 5.6 J/cm2/pulse of radiant energy at the lamp surface. Based on the visual appearance of treated chicken breast pieces, the optimum treatment conditions were determined to be 5 cm-15 s for unpackaged samples and 5 cm-30 s for vacuum-packaged samples, both of which resulted in about 2 log10 CFU/cm2 reduction (~99%). The total energy and temperatures of samples increased with longer treatment time and shorter distance from the quartz window in the pulsed UV-light chamber. The changes in chemical quality and color of samples were determined after mild (13 cm; 5 s), moderate (8 cm; 30 s), and extreme (5 cm; 60 s) treatments. Neither malonaldehyde (MDA) content nor color parameters changed significantly (p>0.05) after mild or moderate treatments. Mechanical properties of the packaging material were analyzed before and after pulsed UV-light treatments. The elastic modulus both along and perpendicular-to-machine direction, and yield strength perpendicular-to-machine direction changed significantly (p<0.05) only after extreme treatment. \nIn the second phase of the study, a pilot-scale pulsed UV-light continuous system was designed, built, and evaluated for its effectiveness on microbial load of whole chicken carcasses.  The pulsed UV-light system consists of a total of four 16 in lamp housings facing each other in series, and a linear rail mounted along the midpoint of the chamber roof. Each chicken surface was inoculated with antibiotics-resistant Escherichia coli K12 inoculum and treated at the 5 cm distance from the quartz window of the lamp housing on each side. The treatment times of 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 s were selected, which correspond to the time each chicken would spend in one set of the systems. The log10 reductions ranged from 0.87 to 1.43 CFU/ml rinse solution after 30-s and 180-s treatments, which correspond to the actuator velocity of 78 and 13 cm/min, respectively. Energy levels for the lamps ranged from 0.24 to 0.25 J/pulse/cm2. Sample temperatures increased significantly (p<0.05) with longer treatment times; and ranged from 11.1 to 44.1 \u00a2\u00aaC. CIELAB color parameters of carcasses after 45, 90, and 180-s treatments were determined. A significant (p<0.05) decrease in L* and increase in b* values were observed after 90-s and 180-s treatments, while a* values did not change significantly (p>0.05) after treatments. The optimum treatment time was identified as 45-s treatment, which resulted in ~1 log10 reduction (90% reduction). \nIn the third phase of the study, the effectiveness of pulsed UV-light on the microbial load and quality of unpackaged and vacuum-packaged chicken frankfurters was investigated. Frankfurters were inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes Scott A on the top surfaces, and then treated with pulsed UV-light for 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 seconds at 5, 8, and 13 cm distance from the quartz window in the pulsed UV-light chamber. Based on the visual appearance, the optimum treatment condition for both unpackaged and vacuum-packaged samples was identified as 60-s treatment at 8 cm, which resulted in about 1.6 and 1.5 log10 CFU/cm2 reductions (both ~97%), respectively.  Temperature changes of samples and total energy (J/cm2) level increased with longer treatment time and shorter distance from the quartz window. Malonaldehyde (MDA) contents of samples did not change significantly (p>0.05) after mild (13 cm; 5-s) and moderate (8 cm; 30-s) treatments. Significant differences (p<0.05) in color parameters were observed after treatments of both unpackaged and packaged samples. Packaging material was also analyzed for mechanical properties. The elastic modulus, yield strength, percent elongation at yield point, maximum tensile strength, and percent elongation at break did not change significantly (p>0.05) after mild treatment. \nIn the final phase of the study, the effectiveness of pulsed UV-light was evaluated for the decontamination of shell-eggs. Shell-eggs inoculated with antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Enteritidis on the top surface at the equator were treated with pulsed UV-light for 1-30 seconds at 9.5 and 14.5 cm from the UV-strobe in the pulsed UV-light chamber. A maximum log10 reduction of 7.7 (CFU/cm2) was obtained after 20-s treatment at 9.5 cm from the UV-lamp (at total dose of 23.6 J/cm2) without any visual damage to the egg. Temperatures of egg-shell surfaces and energy levels showed increases with longer treatment times and shorter distance from the UV-lamp. Pulsed UV-light treatments for 3, 10, and 20 s at either 9.5 or 14.5 cm did not change the albumen height, egg-shell strength or cuticle presence significantly (p>0.05). \nThese results demonstrated that pulsed UV-light has potential to inactivate microorganisms on poultry products in both lab-scale and pilot-scale settings. The effect of pulsed UV-light on the shelf-life of poultry products as well as the ability of the light to penetrate into their surface still needs to be evaluated.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4656], "author_name_tesi": "Keklik, Nene Meltem", "last_name_ssi": "Keklik", "middle_name_ssi": "Meltem", "first_name_ssi": "Nene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Demirci", "Ali Demirci", "Virendra Puri", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Paul H Patterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Demirci, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Demirci, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "Paul H Patterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["decontamination", "Listeria", "Salmonella", "poultry", "pulsed UV light"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EVOLUTION OF MICROSATELLITES IN PRIMATE GENOMES: DEFINITION OF \nMICROSATELLITES, CAUSES OF VARIATION, AND THE MICROSATELLITE LIFE CYCLE\n", "id": "11306", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microsatellites \u2013 simple repeats of short (1-6 bp motifs) - are ubiquitous in eukaryotic genomes, and are hotspots for insertion and deletion (indel) mutations. Due to their variable nature, microsatellites have been extensively used as genetic markers in population genetic and ecological studies. More than 40 neurological diseases in humans are caused by microsatellite instability. In spite of this, there is dearth in our understanding of their mutational mechanism and their birth/death in primate genomes. My dissertation focuses on the following key questions pertaining to the microsatellite life cycle (i.e., microsatellite birth, maturation and eventual loss from genome): 1) What qualifies a repeat to be classified as a microsatellite? 2) Which microsatellite-intrinsic and regional genomic features determine the observed genome wide variation in mutability of mature microsatellites? 3) What are the salient mutational mechanisms that cause microsatellite births and losses in primate genomes? To address these questions, the project was divided into three phases. First, we examined size polymorphism (as indicator of polymerase slippage) at repeat loci found in ten ENCODE regions that were re-sequenced in multiple individuals. In parallel, an in vitro mutagenesis system was established to determine indel frequencies and their dependence on repeat number. Using this combined approach we determined a threshold requirement of 9 repeats for [A/T]n, and of 5 repeats for [GT/AC]n to distinguish their slippage rates from background rate of slippage, thereby allowing them to be classified as micro satellites. In the second phase of the project, we used repeat number variations among human-chimpanzee microsatellite orthologs as suggestive of microsatellite mutability, and implemented a multiple regression approach to determine the predictors of regional variation of microsatellite mutability. We found that microsatellite-intrinsic features, such as repeat number, motif size and motif composition are the key determinants of this variation, and other regional genomic features contribute to this variation marginally. In the third phase of the project, we implemented a maximum parsimony approach to identify mutational steps leading to microsatellite births and deaths within a five primate phylogenetic tree. We found the overwhelming importance of substitutions in causing microsatellite births and deaths. This work also revealed how transposable elements in primate genomes act as important substrates for microsatellite birth-death activity. These results have furthered our understanding of the unique mutational processes taking place at microsatellite loci in primate genomes. They reveal a very complex life cycle of these simple repeats.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6718], "author_name_tesi": "Kelkar, Yogeshwar Dinkar", "last_name_ssi": "Kelkar", "middle_name_ssi": "Dinkar", "first_name_ssi": "Yogeshwar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Mark Shriver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Dissertation Advisor", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Chair", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Mark Shriver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transposable elements", "indel", "mutability", "microsatellite life cycle", "microsatellites", "primates", "multiple regression analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The regulation of mTORC1 signaling in immobilized rat hindlimb skeletal muscle", "id": "22587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10165", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Limb immobilization, limb suspension, and bed rest cause substantial loss of skeletal muscle mass, a phenomenon termed disuse atrophy.  Disuse atrophy is attributed to a depression in the rates of protein synthesis in a fasted state, and a resistance to stimulation by nutrients and other anabolic stimuli.  Skeletal muscle protein synthesis is modulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which is repressed during hindlimb immobilization.  The overall goal of this research was to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for repression of mTORC1 signaling in immobilized rat hindlimb soleus muscle.  The overall hypothesis was that mTORC1 signaling is repressed in immobilized rat hindlimb skeletal muscle due to induction in the mRNA expression of two repressors of mTORC1 signaling, regulated in development and DNA damage responses (REDD) 1 and REDD2.  The studies show that REDD1 and REDD2 mRNA expression are induced in association with repression of mTORC1 signaling after 1-3 days of hindlimb immobilization.  Hindlimb immobilization repressed mTORC1 signaling in a fasted state and blunted the stimulation of mTORC1 signaling in response to a bolus of leucine, a potent nutrient stimulator of mTORC1 signaling.  Fixed muscle length was identified as a physiological trigger for the expression of genes associated with disuse atrophy, particularly REDD1 and REDD2.  These genes were induced in soleus muscle immobilized for 3 days in a shortened position, but not in a stretched position.  Aging was also associated with repression of mTORC1 signaling and induction in the mRNA expression of REDD2, while 7 days of remobilization was associated with augmented mTORC1 signaling and repression in the mRNA expression of REDD2.  Collectively, these findings indicate that the mRNA expression of REDD1, and primarily REDD2 at time points longer than 3 days, is associated with changes in mTORC1 signaling under conditions of hindlimb immobilization, aging, and remobilization.  REDD1 and REDD2 act as repressors and governors of the capacity for mTORC1 signaling in fasted and fed states.  Furthermore, impaired PDK1 signaling to 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) and induction of REDD1 and REDD2 are associated with resistance to anabolic stimulation of mTORC1 signaling.

It directly affects the geographic distribution of aquatic species, and controls many vital biotic and abiotic processes. Climate and land use changes threaten to alter stream temperatures, thereby endangering habitat for aquatic organisms dependent on particular temperature regimes. This effect is especially pronounced in Pennsylvania, where the combined effect of high water temperatures and low flows may render many once cold-water streams uninhabitable for cold and cool water aquatic species in the future.  In order to determine how aquatic ecosystems will be affected by environmental change and how water temperature varies across a region, we need to understand what controls water temperature sensitivity. To investigate both controls on and sensitivity of stream temperature, we define \u2018thermal elasticity\u2019 to quantify the sensitivity of a given stream to environmental change. Thermal elasticity was shown to vary from near zero to one across Pennsylvania, and controls were identified to be stream size (stream order), shading (shading factor) and groundwater contribution (baseflow index).

While they are abundant, headwater streams are typically unmonitored.  As such, little is known about how they will be impacted by climate and land use change.  It is widely regarded that environmental change, representing the combined effects of changing land use and climate, is currently altering many natural processes in landscapes across the globe, and is expected to have significant impacts in headwater streams.  There is an urgent need to understand the sensitivity of headwater streams to change, as well as the physical mechanisms that control this change and how they vary across differences in climate, vegetation, geology, and topography.  Comparative hydrology, one such approach, describes similarities and differences in catchment behavior in terms of the evolution and current status of physical setting.  In this dissertation, we use comparisons across a range of spatial and temporal scales to understand what physical characteristics, represented by model parameters, most influence model-predicted hydrologic behavior.  In our first study, we apply this framework to understand how dominant processes relate to physical setting for the one-dimensional transport with inflow and storage (OTIS) model, a transient storage model which is used to characterize streams in terms of parameter values.  We show that not all parameters, representative of stream processes across a given reach, may be able to be used in this characterization for all streams.  Additionally, we show that which parameters are sensitive, and therefore viable to be used for stream reach characterization, varies with physical setting across a single stream.  In our second and third studies, we use comparisons between headwater catchments to understand how soil and vegetation properties influence variability in hydrologic behavior.  Sensitivity analysis is used in conjunction with a distributed, physically-based watershed model, used to simulate hydrologic behavior.  In the second study, we compare similarities and differences in controls on behavior for five adjacent headwater catchments located in central Montana.  Similar catchment characteristics and properties control this behavior at similar times across all of the basins.  Differences in parameter controls and our ability to explain this behavior are attributed to variability in vegetation and geologic influence via a fault that runs through the basin.  In our last study, we compare controls on behavior for four headwater catchments located in different climates across the United States.  We show variable seasonality for periods when important parameters are sensitive across different water balance components.  Vegetation characteristics are an important control on evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent across all basins and streamflow for drier basins.  Soil characteristics largely governed variance in streamflow, though which characteristics were important varied with climate and topography.  In both studies, we demonstrate a framework for investigating controls on basins without observations, as parameters are specified a priori, as well as for investigating the potential sensitivity of these basins to changes in land use.  Future work should investigate the applicability of this approach to ungauged basins, as well as the potential for this framework to be used to understand changes and sensitivity to land use and climate change.  Ultimately, by linking model-inferred dominant processes to similarities and differences in physical setting, we are able to improve an understanding of headwater functioning.  The comparative studies at all scales offer the potential extrapolate relationships between physical setting and the sensitivity of hydrological behavior to change across the United States.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8945], "author_name_tesi": "Kelleher, Christa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Kelleher", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Christa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thorsten Wagener", "Michael Gooseff", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "Christopher J Duffy", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thorsten Wagener, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Gooseff, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrology", "headwater streams", "sensitivity analysis", "watersheds"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Beyond individual differences: The role of differentiation of self in predicting the career exploration of college students", "id": "7244", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "652", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study sought to test Super\u2019s (1957) assertion that individual and environmental variables interact to shape one\u2019s career development.

Additionally, if the material properties of a mechanical structure can be identified within a smaller range, then the remaining life prediction of that structure will be substantially more accurate. Typically, neither the damage state nor the material properties are known precisely for any given structure.  Decision systems for maintenance and usage scheduling are often based on analytically derived reliability and anticipated usage patterns.  At best, if the anticipated and actual usages are approximately the same, these systems can only project worst-case remaining life that is considerably worse than the average case.  Thus almost all structures must be inspected and repaired on a schedule that is more conservative than is required for a given margin of safety.  However, in a very common scenario, usage is considerably more demanding than the design usage, and thus the systems are not conservative enough, leading to unexpected failures and safety concerns.  Information-based decision systems can rely on physical models, estimation of material properties, exact knowledge of usage history, and sensor data to synthesize an accurate snapshot of the current state of damage and the likely remaining life of a structure under given assumed loading.  Thus the future usage can be modified, either through mission planning or through damage mitigating control in order to optimally use the remaining life of a structure.   \nThe work outlined in this dissertation is structured to enhance the development of information-based decision and control systems.  This is achieved by constructing a test facility for laboratory experiments on real-time damage sensing.  This test facility make use of a methodology that has been formulated for fatigue crack model parameter estimation and significantly improves the quality of predictions of remaining life.   Specifically, the dissertation focuses on development of an on-line fatigue crack damage sensing and life prediction system that is built upon the disciplines of Systems Sciences and Mechanics of Materials.  A major part of the research effort has been expended to design and fabricate a test apparatus which allows: (i)  measurement and recording of statistical data for fatigue crack growth in metallic materials via different sensing techniques;  and (ii) identification of stochastic model parameters for prediction of fatigue crack damage.  To this end, this dissertation  describes the test apparatus and the associated instrumentation based on four different sensing techniques, namely, traveling optical microscopy, ultrasonic flaw detection, Alternating Current Potential Drop (ACPD), and fiber-optic extensometry-based compliance, for crack length measurements.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1735], "author_name_tesi": "Keller, Eric Evans", "last_name_ssi": "Keller", "middle_name_ssi": "Evans", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Albert Koss", "Asok Ray", "Eric Russell Marsh", "Shashi Phoha", "Marc Carpino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Albert Koss, Committee Member", "Asok Ray, Committee Chair", "Eric Russell Marsh, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Marc Carpino, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["damage", "ultrasonic", "fatigue crack"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Analysis and Control of the Transient Aeroelastic Response of Rotors During Shipboard Engagement and Disengagement Operations", "id": "5850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2517", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-03-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An analysis has been developed to predict the transient aeroelastic response of a helicopter rotor system during shipboard engagement and disengagement operations.  The coupled flap-lag-torsion equations of motion were developed using Hamilton\u2019s Principle and discretized spatially using the finite element method.  Aerodynamics were simulated using nonlinear quasi-steady or time domain nonlinear unsteady models.  The ship airwake environment was simulated with simple deterministic airwake distributions, results from experimental measurements or numerical predictions.  The transient aeroelastic response of the rotor blades was then time-integrated along a specified rotor speed profile.  The control of the rotor response for an analytic model of the H-46 Sea Knight rotor system was investigated with three different passive control techniques.  Collective pitch scheduling was only successful in reducing the blade flapping response in a few isolated cases.  In the majority of cases, the blade transient response was increased.  The use of a discrete flap damper in the very low rotor speed region was also investigated.  Only by raising the flap stop setting and using a flap damper four times the strength of the lag damper could the downward flap deflections be reduced.  However, because the flap stop setting was raised the upward flap deflections were often increased.  The use of extendable/retractable, gated leading-edge spoilers in the low rotor speed region was also investigated.  Spoilers covering the outer 15%R of the rotor blade were shown to significantly reduce both the upward and downward flap response without increasing rotor torque.  Previous aeroelastic analyses developed at the University of Southampton and at Penn State University were completed with flap-torsion degrees of freedom only.  The addition of the lag degree of freedom was shown to significantly influence the blade response.  A comparison of the two aerodynamic models showed that the nonlinear quasi-steady aerodynamic model consistently yielded a larger blade response than the time domain nonlinear unsteady model.  The transient blade response was also compared using the simple deterministic and numerically predicted ship airwakes for a frigate-like ship shape.  The blade response was often much larger for the numerically predicted ship airwakes and was also much more dependent on deck location, wind speed and wind direction.  Fluctuating flow components in the range of frequencies measured in previous ship airwake tests were shown to increase the blade response.  A separate analysis was developed to investigate the feedback control of gimballed rotor systems using swashplate actuation.  The equations of motion for a rigid, three-bladed gimballed rotor system were derived and aerodynamic forces were simulated with a simple, linear attached flow model.  A time domain Linear Quadratic Regulator optimal control technique was applied to the equations of motion to minimize the transient rotor response.  The maximum transient gimbal tilt angle was reduced by as much as half within the current physical limits of the control system; further reduction was achieved by increasing the limits.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2499], "author_name_tesi": "Keller, Jonathan Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Keller", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre", "Kon Well Wang", "Edward C Smith", "Lyle Norman Long", "Farhan S Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Chair", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Farhan S Gandhi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["helicopters", "blade strike", "H-46 aircraft", "shipboard", "aeroelasticity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Structure and Dynamics of C-H-Bond-Cleaving High-Valent Iron Intermediates", "id": "14215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5254", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "C-H bond cleavage is one of the primary tenets of the chemical world. Industry has long searched for more efficient commercial processes to functionalize C-H bonds to activate such molecules as hydrocarbons. Current processes require large amounts of energy and often expensive reagents and often produce a number of increasingly less desirable pollutants such as carbon dioxide. Discovering a process that requires less energy input or is more environmentally neutral is still a very desirable research goal. The natural world already has generated a number of enzymatic processes that can activate C-H bonds at ambient temperatures and pressures. These oxygenase enzymes typically operate at temperatures less than 37 oC and atmospheric pressure. Both heme and non-heme containing oxygenases as well as certain DNA cleaving anti-cancer compounds activate C-H bonds via high valent iron-oxo compounds. A C-H bond activating organic molecule of interest to this document is bleomycin. Bleomycin is a glycopeptide macrocycle used in clinical situations as Blenoxane \u00ae for treatment of a variety of cancers. It coordinates an iron with five nitrogen (or four nitrogen and one oxygen) ligands allowing a sixth coordination site to bind molecular oxygen in a manner similar to heme oxygenases. The clinical function of bleomycin is to bind DNA and activate the C4 hydrogen to generate single and double strand breaks in the chain and ultimately cause the death of the cancerous cell. Here, samples of the activated form of bleomycin have been cryoreduced in an attempt to observe an Fe(IV)=O containing species that has not been previously characterized. The non-heme, taurine:\u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) dioxygenase (TauD) has been found to activate C-H bonds by generating an Fe(IV)=O species in order to hydroxylate substrate. The ferryl species of TauD has already been well characterized, but recent observations suggested that in the ferryl state, TauD may be able to release and rebind the taurine substrate. Here, substrate exchange during the ferryl and ferrous states of TauD is one main focus of this study. The primary difference between the \u03b1KG dependent oxygenase family of enzymes and the halogenase SyrB2 is that SyrB2 contains an alanine rather than a carboxylate ligand in the iron coordinating facial triad. Recent studies have shown that under certain conditions SyrB2 is able to hydroxylate its substrate. The carboxylate residue of TauD is D101, and the D101A variant was generated for studies to determine if TauD D101A is able to bind Cl- and potentially halogenate its substrate. P450s have been studied for more than 50 years and until recently, the Fe(IV)=O intermediate in their reaction had not been characterized. The novel P450 fatty acid hydroxylating peroxygenase from Bacillus subtilis P450BS\u03b2 was believed to be a good candidate to observe P450 Compound I, the Fe(IV)=O species that is coupled to a \u03c0-cation radical. Characterization of a P450 Compound I from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius rendered the search for a P450 Compound I much less novel. Studies of P450BS\u03b2 never produced spectra of a Compound I- like species. However, other observations made through the course of study yielded further insight into the reaction and capabilities of P450BS\u03b2 that have not been previously reported.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5231], "author_name_tesi": "Keller, Rebecca Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Keller", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carsten Krebs", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Michael Thomas Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carsten Krebs, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Michael Thomas Green, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["C-H activation", "TauD", "Bleomycin", "P450"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Elucidating Evolutionary Constraints of Mouse Mammary Cancer Using Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Mutations", "id": "15024rrk145", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15024", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cancer is a disease of evolution. Species evolve because mutations are passed to progeny through the germline, but somatic cells acquire mutations as well, and somatic mutation can initiate cancer. In addition, established cancers themselves evolve. Within a tumor, ongoing mutagenesis creates cell-to-cell genetic diversity, allowing subpopulations to undergo natural selection in Darwinian fashion. With a surplus of cells and a staggering number of potential mutations, evolution could, in theory, empower a tumor to overcome a plethora of obstacles. But fortunately, cancer evolution is restricted. Chemical, genetic, cellular, and environmental evolutionary constraints make cancer vulnerable. To uncover novel constraints, we utilized mouse model systems of breast cancer, specifically models driven by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene, which antagonizes oncogenic Wnt signaling.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we show that chemical and genetic constraints can direct which oncogenes are selected to cooperate in driving cancer. In mice that develop reversible, Wnt pathway-dependent mammary cancers (iWnt mice), exposure to chemical carcinogens that preferentially form adducts with either adenine (7,12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, DMBA) or thymine (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, ENU) resulted in activating mutations affecting different genes in the oncogenic Ras-Raf pathway (HrasCAA61CTA or BrafGTG636GAG, respectively). Both these mutations occur at A:T base pairs, but differ because in Hras, adenine resides on the sense strand, while in Braf, thymine does. This implicated strand-biased processes, such as strand-specific DNA repair, in mutagenesis. To confirm this, we generated DMBA- and ENU-induced mammary tumors in Apcmin mice, which inherit one nonfunctional Apc allele but routinely acquire second-hit mutations en route to mammary tumorigenesis. Exposure to each chemical led to distinct second-hit Apc mutation patterns, including strand-inverse mutation signatures at A:T sites, which precisely matched the mutation bias observed in Ras-Raf oncogenes. The findings indicate that a mutagen\u2019s chemistry paired with DNA repair processes may have an outsized influence on which cancer driver genes are selected, independent of other pressures.\n\nIn Chapter 3, we exploited patterns of second-hit Apc driver mutations to demonstrate that ionizing radiation (IR) perturbs mutation spectra in a dose-dependent manner, implying different doses drive cancer evolution via different mechanisms. In Apcmin mice, low-dose IR exposure (1 Gy), whether administered as a one-time dose or fractionated daily doses increased mammary tumor incidence without altering the mutation spectrum compared with IR-na\u00efve tumors. By contrast, high-dose IR (5 Gy) not only increased tumor incidence, but also shifted the mutation spectrum towards microdeletions, a putative signature of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Since IR is routinely used to treat breast cancer patients, we went on to determine how IR exposures impact mammary tumor cells. We introduced the Apcmin allele into iWnt mice and determined how IR exposure delivered prior to Wnt withdrawal impacted second-hit Apc mutations responsible for initiating relapse. Again, effects of low- and high-dose IR diverged. Low-dose IR augmented relapse but did not change the mutation spectrum from IR-na\u00efve. By contrast, high-dose IR augmented relapse further and exhibited a microdeletion signature characteristic of DSBs. Thus, high IR doses likely introduce DNA mutations by direct DNA damage, while lower doses promote tumor evolution via indirect mechanisms. These findings have implications for assessing cancer risk and planning radiotherapy regimens.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 4 we establish that oncogene overdose is a powerful evolutionary constraint that remains in force throughout tumor lifespan. At tumor initiation, mammary gland cells acquired mutations conferring an elevated, but submaximal oncogenic signal, avoiding oncogene overdose. However, for overdose to render cancer vulnerable, the constraint must remain through stages of tumor progression. Thus, we show that tumor cells responsible for initiating relapse following Wnt withdrawal (i.e. rescue subclones, RSCs) acquired second-hit Apc mutations conferring oncogene overdose avoidance, but we also show RSCs are still susceptible to oncogene overdose. Selection for these mutations during therapy involves an evolutionary trade-off. Rescue mutations, which enhance fitness by restoring oncogenic signaling during therapy, instead reduce fitness by driving oncogene overdose while superimposed on native (i.e., undrugged) signaling. Consistent with this model, RSCs underwent dynamic turnover prior to therapy, and RSCs generated by a timed mutagen exposure decreased in number when therapy was delayed or transiently interrupted. We ruled out neutral drift dynamics by demonstrating RSCs compete poorly against therapy-sensitive parental clones during tumor growth and were lost when the endogenous signal is increased to maximum. Exploiting this vulnerability could further efforts to eliminate cancer cells that drive relapse.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16462], "author_name_tesi": "Keller, Ross Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Keller", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Ross", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Lisa M Shantz", "James Riley Broach", "Sarah Bronson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "James Riley Broach, Outside Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cancer", "Evolution", "Genetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Inside the Madhouse: Bernard Herrmann's \"Psycho\"", "id": "11853", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "27", "abstract_tesi": "Bernard Herrmann\u2019s score to Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s definitive slasher film from 1960, enhances the emotional and mental aspects of the characters through musical techniques designed to complement the image track.

This dissertation was inspired by the perception of a compelling need to define leadership better and obtain a greater understanding of how leadership can be developed and effectively practiced. \nI describe in this dissertation a process by which a theory of leadership was conceptualized, constructed, situated in the literature, tested, and applied to the practice of leadership.  This process was recursive, dynamic, and incremental.  The initial theory, constructed through the use of a qualitative study, was refined several times throughout the process to reflect the ongoing flow of information and insights realized at different stages of the dissertation.  It is a powerful theory that provides valuable insights into leadership, but it is also a dynamic theory that will grow and evolve as additional research provides new insights into its principles.  \nConstructed using Grounded Theory methodology, Dynamic Leadership Theory (DLT) proposes that leadership is defined as changing the cognitive processes of individuals or groups.  Constructive leadership is leaders\u2019 infusion of positive, aligned meaning.  Ineffective leadership occurs when leaders fail to affect an individual\u2019s or group\u2019s meaning or purpose.  Destructive leadership occurs when leaders diminish or destroy meaning.  Leadership is a dynamic process that can occur in networks, as an emergent phenomenon, and that changes frequently depending on the circumstances and individuals involved.  Leadership is dependent on relationships, communication, positivism, resilience, and self-efficacy as the means by which leaders infuse meaning into a group.  \nThese principles were tested by the quantitative analysis of a survey of 308 healthcare leaders in Central Pennsylvania.  Of the theory\u2019s five hypotheses, three were confirmed and two were partially confirmed.  Relationships were found to be significantly correlated with Constructive Leadership. Communication, positivism and resiliency were found to be powerful moderators of the association between relationships and Constructive Leadership.  Self-efficacy was shown to be a significant moderator of the effects of these three variables on relationships. Significant covariation between communication, resilience and positivism allowed them to be combined into a single variable, which in turn resulted in a more parsimonious but statistically robust model of DLT.  The revised theory provides crucial insights into the effective practice of leadership, the ways in which leadership can be ineffective or destructive, and ways in which leadership can be developed.  \nDLT provides important contributions to the field of leadership.  It defines leadership based on a cognitive ontology in a way that allows for the construction of a comprehensive theory of leadership. It describes a spectrum of leadership manifestations, from Constructive to Ineffective to Destructive, which allows a better understanding of how different behaviors fit into the leadership rubric, and how leaders can be developed and evaluated.  It identifies key contributing factors to leadership, including relationships, communication, resilience, positivism and self-efficacy, and presents the connections between these variables as they affect the practice of leadership.  It incorporates the dynamic nature of leadership into our understanding of the term, noting that leaders and leadership evolve and change frequently depending on the context of the situation.  It also highlights the potential risks of applying quantitative methods to behavioral variables.  \n\tDLT is built upon the concepts of other major leadership theories, and provides opportunities for continued development and refining of these leadership principles. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9020], "author_name_tesi": "Kellis, Dana Sterling", "last_name_ssi": "Kellis", "middle_name_ssi": "Sterling", "first_name_ssi": "Dana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bing Ran", "Triparna B Vasavada", "Odd Jonas Stalebrink", "Melvin Blumberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bing Ran, Dissertation Advisor", "Triparna B Vasavada, Committee Member", "Odd Jonas Stalebrink, Committee Member", "Melvin Blumberg, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Healthcare leadership", "leadership theory", "physician leadership", "nursing leadership", "constructive leadership"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "TESTING AN INNOVATIVE METHOD TO COLLECT ADVERSE EVENTS \nDATA: A METHODOLOGICAL STUDY\n", "id": "6166", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6387", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Title: Testing an Innovative Method to Collect Adverse Events Data: A Methodological Study\nAuthor: Victoria A. Kellogg, RN, MSN, CRNP, MBA, PhD(c)\nPennsylvania State University, School of Nursing\n\nPurpose: The Shift Coupon was designed to provide a more accurate measure of adverse events occurring in the hospital setting by eliminating the two overriding barriers to reporting adverse events: \u201c[1] fear and [2] lack of belief that it [reporting the adverse event] results in improvement\u201d (Leape, 1999, p. 1). Thus, the study purposes were to test the ability of the Shift Coupon to collect adverse events data and to explore the hospital work environment as it related to registered nurses\u2019 reports of adverse events.\n\nMethods: Design: Nonexperimental descriptive, comparative; Sample: 1,000 randomly selected registered nurses; Instruments: Shift Coupon and Blegen/Vaughn Work Environment Index; Procedure: Mailed registered nurses surveys following Dillman\u2019s (2000) Tailored Design Method.  Registered nurses completed Shift Coupons for 5 shifts and the Blegen/Vaughn Work Environment Index then returned completed instruments; Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and chi-square.\n\nResults: 355 registered nurses returned 1937 Shift Coupons (46.7% response rate), with 247 (69.6%) registered nurses returning 1369 coupons for shifts worked in a hospital.  On the majority of Shift Coupons (70.9%) registered nurses reported that no adverse event occurred.  The most commonly reported adverse events were: patient complaints (21.4%), medication errors (18.9%), family complaints (17.6%), and patient falls (12.1%).  Registered nurses identified lack of staff (36.8%), lack of communication (30.5%), and work overload (29.5%) as the most frequent causes of adverse events.  Shift Coupons did collect more adverse events data than incident reports (p<.001).  Blegen/Vaughn Work Environment Index data supported the underreporting of adverse events and Shift Coupon findings and provided insights for future coupon studies.   \n\nConclusion: The Shift Coupon is a viable method to collect adverse events data.\n\nImplications: The Shift Coupon provides a method for collecting adverse events data in the hospital setting that attenuates barriers to reporting adverse events while placing front-line healthcare professionals in a position to identify direct and indirect adverse event cause(s).  Shift Coupon data can be used to isolate areas needing quality improvement and to develop appropriate quality improvement initiative(s) to decrease the occurrence of adverse events.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6387], "author_name_tesi": "Kellogg, Victoria Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Kellogg", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Victoria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Samantha Havens", "Kathleen M Fisher", "David R Johnson", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Pamela J Mitchell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Samantha Havens, Committee Chair", "Kathleen M Fisher, Committee Member", "David R Johnson, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["shift coupon", "adverse events"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Estimating Migration to Pennsylvania Counties Due to Marcellus Shale Drilling Activity", "id": "15388", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7855", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 2003, the first natural gas well was drilled into the Marcellus Shale in Washington County, Pennsylvania.

However, most of the prior research has focused on the social impacts of rapid population change rather than attempting to quantify the change that has taken place. Due to the unique nature of economic development associated with natural resource extraction development, current methods of population estimation may fail to fully capture the population change which is occurring. Using the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s population estimates for Pennsylvania counties, I find that after controlling for other factors that may affect population change and county population estimate accuracy, net migration estimates between 2000 and 2010 are underestimated relatively more in the northeastern counties of Pennsylvania, which is where most of the drilling activity has taken place thus far. This may indicate that population change is occurring at a rate faster than expected in this area and that population estimates are not fully capturing the change in this region. The same cannot be said for the southwestern counties of the state, which have also experienced extensive drilling activity. Considering the Bureau\u2019s population estimates are used for allocating funds related to various government programs, these findings have important implications for state and local government agencies in areas which have experienced drilling activity, as well as those which expect to in the future.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7782], "author_name_tesi": "Kelly, Andrew Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Kelly", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark R Leach", "Dr Diane Mc Laughlin", "Dr Kathy Brasier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark R Leach, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Diane Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Kathy Brasier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus", "migration", "boomtown", "population", "Census", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Next Generation of Binary Black Hole Head-On Collisions, and their Aftermath", "id": "6289", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I present new results in the full 3D evolution of black hole binary systems, for the head-on collision case.

The Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR), located at the Radiation Science and Engineering Center (RSEC), is utilized to irradiate samples for NAA applications. The current work presents the implementation of the k0-standardization method of NAA at the PSBR. For the application of the k0-method, the neutron flux characterization parameters of the irradiation facility must be accurately measured. The neutron flux characterization parameters for the irradiation positions in the PSBR core, namely the dry irradiation tubes 1 and 2 (DT-1 and DT-2), were measured by irradiating the bare gold-aluminum wires (0.112% Au), lutetium-aluminum wires (0.1% Lu), and high purity zirconium foils provided in the k0-IAEA Software Package. The thermal to epithermal neutron flux ratio (f), epithermal flux shape factor (\u03b1), the average neutron temperature (Tn), and the spectral index (r\u221a(Tn/T0 )) parameters were measured as follows: 23.1 \u00b1 1.8, -0.067 \u00b1 0.02, 308 \u00b1 19 K, and 0.051 \u00b1 0.004 for DT-1 and 24.3 \u00b1 1.9, -0.077 \u00b1 0.03, 314 \u00b1 20 K, and 0.051 \u00b1 0.004 for DT-2, respectively. Samples from five certified standard reference materials were analyzed, including NBS-1575 Pine Needles, NBS-1573 Tomato Leaves, NIST-2704 Buffalo River Sediment, NBS-1633a Trace Elements in Coal Fly Ash, and NBS-98b Plastic Clay. The samples were irradiated in each dry tube for 10 minutes at 800 kWt power. Gamma ray spectroscopy was performed on the activated samples and their constituent concentrations were calculated using the standard INAA method and the established k0-method. The measured elemental concentrations were then compared with respective certified and/or information elemental concentration values for each standard reference material. In total, 20 elements were identified using the implemented analytical methods. Elemental concentrations measured for Na, Sc, Ca, Zn, Ba, Hf, Ce, Se, K, Cr, Ga, As, Br, Sb, La, Sm, Eu, Fe, Mn, and Rb were all in reasonable agreement with the certified/information concentrations for most of the samples. The majority of the z-scores for the k0-method were less than those of the INAA method for all of the analyzed standard reference materials. The percent error of the measured elemental concentrations was greatly reduced when using the k0-method rather than the INAA method, therefore validating the accuracy of the k0-method also established for the PSBR.

Because sea spray can significantly affect this ocean-air exchange, accurate hurricane models need to account for spray effects.  We incorporate sea spray into large-eddy simulations (LES) to explore its role in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) of hurricanes, allowing us to assess the validity of and offer improvements to the simple spray parameterizations currently used in hurricane models.  We investigate thermodynamic feedback between spray and surface heat fluxes, and examine the effects of spray upon the dynamics of the hurricane boundary layer.  \n\nResults of preliminary LES, which use a bulk representation of the dominant range of spray sizes and a simplified diagnostic phase change scheme, indicate an appreciable amount of spray-air heat transfer---consistent with theory---and demonstrate a form of spray-induced thermodynamic feedback.  The LES model of the hurricane atmospheric boundary layer (HABL) is adapted to account for variations in spray generation due to wave-breaking, momentum transfer between air and spray in both the vertical (liquid loading and stratification) and horizontal (drag), and dissipative heating in an emulsion-like two-phase environment.  These modifications are accompanied by extension of the phase change and spray generation schemes to account for different droplet sizes, and implementation of a moving three-dimensional boundary.  Collective inclusion of all these pieces of modeled physics in the LES provides results which offer a better view of the limitations of current spray-flux models, and motivates a simpler and improved alternative model.  The refined results of the `full' LES-HABL model are consistent with early simulations, and underscore the significance of boundary-layer scale thermodynamic balance, spray-induced fluxes, and wind-dependent thermodynamic feedback.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3993], "author_name_tesi": "Kelly, Mark C.", "last_name_ssi": "Kelly", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Corry Wyngaard", "William Menaul Frank", "Jerry Y Harrington", "James Gordon Brasseur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Corry Wyngaard, Committee Chair", "William Menaul Frank, Committee Member", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hurricanes", "tropical cyclones", "hurricane simulation", "atmospheric turbulence", "sea spray", "large-eddy simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A CASE STUDY IN CITIZEN LEADERSHIP DURING CRISIS:\nTHE EXPERIENCES OF THE WOMEN OF THE STORM \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10528", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4022", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative case study explores the experiences of members of the organization known as the Women of the Storm who in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, stepped into the vacuum of traditional leadership to bring members of Congress and funding to New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.

The study also explores the relationship of leadership formative and learning experiences among the participants as they relate to leadership development and its emergence in the wake of Katrina.  The analysis of data resulted in the emergence of six primary themes: 1) the impact and extent of Hurricane Katrina and the ensuing crises, 2) the vacuum of leadership after Katrina and the ensuing consideration of what leadership means, 3) the role of Women of the Storm throughout the Katrina crisis, 4) the experiences related to leadership development, 5) the emergence of citizen leaders, and 6) networking among people.  These themes were synthesized into four areas of discussion.  First, the experiences and perspectives of the participants offer a unique, first hand, framework for exploring what leadership means in a time of crisis.  Second, these same experiences begin to shed new light on the role of citizens and emergent organizations in times of crisis.  Third, the participants\u2019 reflections on experiences related to leadership development provide a bridge between the ideas related to how leadership is learned and how these experiences become meaningful during times of crisis.  Finally, the ability of the citizens to utilize and build new social networks demonstrates the value of social capital in times of crisis.

The curriculum is based on experiential learning model that is structured around direct participation: experiencing, thinking, discussing, and applying what the youth have learned to their daily lives. Five research question/hypotheses guided this investigation. A quasi-experimental design consisting of pretest-posttest comparison control group was used. The intervention in this study consisted of six nutrition lessons from the curriculum. To evaluate the nutrition education lessons, three measurements were taken at pretest (time 1), posttest (time 2), and delayed posttest (time 3). Participants included youth in two afterschool programs receiving nutrition education lessons through the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program of Penn State Nutrition Links. A total of 86 students both in the treatment and control groups participated in the study. A four-part evaluation tool was developed to collect data. Part one contained questions pertaining to general nutrition knowledge and physical activity. Part two contained statements about attitude towards nutrition, fruits and vegetable consumption, and eating healthy and making healthful food choices. Part three contained statements on nutrition and physical activity behaviors. Part four contained demographic questions such as gender, age, grade level and ethnicity. Hands-on nutrition education lessons were taught to youth in the treatment group each week over a four-week period. Pretest data was collected before intervention, posttest data collected after the four weeks of intervention, and delayed posttest data collected after two weeks of posttest data collection. The control group did not receive any lessons. General linear model (GLM) procedures were performed. Results from repeated measures ANCOVA posttest and delayed posttest with pretest as a covariate showed that youth who received nutrition education lessons significantly improved their nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and nutrition behaviors compared to those who did not participate in the lessons. Physical activity knowledge and physical activity behaviors also improved from pretest to posttest and delayed posttest. However, factorial ANOVA with repeated measures pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest indicated no significant differences between nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and nutrition behaviors when participants were examined by gender, grade level, and age. The significant improvement for nutrition knowledge and physical activity knowledge, attitudes, and nutrition behaviors and physical activity behaviors indicated program effectiveness regardless of the demographic characteristics examined in the study.

Producing, transporting, and storing large square bales have many advantages over both small square bale and round bale counterparts as well as other possible harvest methods. These advantages stem from the high capacity of the machines and both storage and transportation characteristics of the bales. To optimize the logistics of switchgrass as a biomass feedstock, the characteristics of harvesting switchgrass with a large square baler must be well understood. Parameters that effect switchgrass large square bale production and handling logistics are the focus of this research.\nA New Holland large square baler was used to harvest switchgrass biomass in May of 2010. The biomass had been cut with a discbine the previous fall and left to overwinter on the ground in order to create a spring harvest situation. The large square baler was able to produce bales that approached 200 kg/m3 at 12% (w.b.) moisture content. Fuel consumption of the tractor that powered the baler did not significantly change when different bale density setting were applied to the baler. However, the efficiency of the baler was found to be heavily dependent on windrow density and consistency. The square bale handling capabilities were then studied at a commercial farm to determine the benefits of producing denser bales in terms of labor and energy costs.\nLab scale compression tests were performed to analysis the effects of harvest time and moisture content on switchgrass large square bale production. For the switchgrass samples compressed at various moisture contents, no statistical differences in the specific energy required for compression were found when only the dry matter bulk density was considered. The spring harvested samples were found to require more energy to compact than the fall harvested samples, mainly due to a decrease in the leaf to stem ratio caused by the biomass overwintering in the field.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [649], "author_name_tesi": "Kemmerer, Benjamin David", "last_name_ssi": "Kemmerer", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jude Liu", "Jude Liu", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Marvin H Hall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jude Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Jude Liu, Thesis Advisor", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Thesis Advisor", "Marvin H Hall, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Density", "Harvest", "Large Square Bale", "Biomass"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "STEADY STATE FLOW STUDIES OF SECTIONS IN NATURAL GAS PIPELINE NETWORKS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9185", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3365", "abstract_tesi": "Efficient transportation of natural gas is vital to the success of the economy of the US and the world, because of the various uses of natural gas and its components.

Loops consisting of different numbers of pipes are analyzed to study the accuracy of prediction by any particular friction factor equation for the particular segment of the gas pipeline network. The Newton-Raphson method was utilized for solving the networks. No equation currently available, is able to predict pressures and flow rates accurately for all cases.

An improved understanding of how karst heterogeneity impacts field-scale hydrology will support more accurate interpretation of hydrologic data. This study aimed to apply near-surface geophysics, specifically electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and seismic refraction methods, to characterize karst bedrock structure and topography, and to describe the role of these features in surface and subsurface hydrology. This study uses twelve replicated field-scale lysimeter plots established in a shallow hillslope. Replicated field-scale lysimeters studies are rare, having only been attempted on two farms in the UK (Armstrong and Garwood, 1991; Cannell et al., 1984; Harris et al, 1984, Haygarth and Jarvis, 1997; Haygarth et al., 1998; Preedy et al., 2001) and one study in the USA by Bosch et al. (2005). Each lysimeter is engineered to be hydrologically isolated from other lysimeters and from offsite drainage. The scale, replications and engineering of these lysimeters provide a unique framework for a hydrologic study, but true hydrologic isolation is questionable due to karst development of the underlying Bellefonte formation dolomite.\nMeasurement and subsampling of surface runoff and shallow subsurface flows have been continuous since 2012. Flows enter pipe drains established at the soil surface and the soil-bedrock interface in each plot and are rerouted to one of two main collection houses. High variability in storm responses among the plots supports the hypothesis that hydrologic isolation may be breached by interconnection with shallow karstic features in the weathered epikarst zone underlying the site. An extensive ERT survey was conducted consisting of 25 survey lines configured as a rectangular grid. Each line was collected using Wenner and Dipole-Dipole arrays to compare and maximize resolution in both the vertical and horizontal directions. All data underwent reciprocal analysis to identify and remove outliers, which to reduced errors during inversion using RES2DINV/RES3DINV inversion software. Borehole and seismic refraction data were collected to constrain our ERT results and improve confidence in the resolution of our final model, bolstering our interpretations of subsurface structure and bedrock topography. The results of this study suggest that subsurface drainage in the epikarst influences subsurface flow at the site, complicating traditional topographic controls on hillslope hydrology. In addition, the methods used in this study reveal the effectiveness of paired near-surface geophysics in providing substantial subsurface information to improve our understanding of karst hydrology at a field scale without the need for invasive subsurface characterization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14386], "author_name_tesi": "Kennedy, Curtis Ross", "last_name_ssi": "Kennedy", "middle_name_ssi": "Ross", "first_name_ssi": "Curtis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tess Russo", "Anthony Buda", "Andrew Nyblade", "Casey Kennedy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tess Russo, Thesis Advisor", "Anthony Buda, Committee Member", "Andrew Nyblade, Committee Member", "Casey Kennedy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogeophysics", "Hydrogeology", "Hydrology", "Geology", "Karst", "Resistivity", "Agronomy", "Agriculture", "Lysimetry", "Carbonate"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The American Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Fiction", "id": "15979", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project investigates how nineteenth-century writers portrayed the American Revolution in fiction.  Nationalism is typically described as a homogenizing social force, one that crafts a sense of unity among a civic body \u2013 but also one that excludes minority populations.  I argue that U.S. nationalism was constructed around eighteenth-century conceptions of the liberal citizen, characterized by the ability to enter the political discussion found in the public sphere by assuming the mantle of \u201cvirtuous disinterest,\u201d a commitment to rationalism, and above all the belief in the ability to act without restraint.  These traits are coincident with the rise of middle-class political power in the Age of Revolution.  As U.S. society moved towards industrial modes of production over the nineteenth century, writers retold the story of the Revolution in order to affiliate new political positions with the ideals and values of the nation.  Proponents of both class and abolitionist politics took up this work with the aim of changing (or revolutionizing) society.  For proponents of working-class interests, this meant challenging the liberal beliefs that equated being American with economic success \u2013 and that relegated economic interests to the apolitical order of the private sphere.  For abolitionists, it meant challenging the belief that people of African descent had a political destiny separate from the nation.  For both, it meant understanding that the body was as important in constructing identity as the mind and that the ability to act was always conditioned by social limitations.  My dissertation shows how the Revolution was culturally imagined first as the outgrowth of liberal values as demonstrated in the fiction of Charles Brockden Brown and Washington Irving, and then was challenged by writers with working-class and abolitionist politics such as George Lippard, Herman Melville, William Wells Brown and Lydia Maria Child.

Accumulation of such damage can lead to unsuccessful secondary ion mass spectrometry depth profiling experiments.\n\nThe first objective is to develop and test a methodology for incorporating reactions in cluster bombardment simulations, which has been shown to be difficult due to the high computational cost of such simulations. Initially, a reactive force field used to describe the interactions between atoms was tested for its ability to model reactions related to the build-up and removal of damage during depth profiling experiments of two organic polymers. Next, a protocol for a mixed resolution model was designed that partitioned a test sample of solid benzene into atomistic and coarse-grained regions. The atomistic region incorporated interactions described by a complex reactive potential, and the coarse-grained region\u2019s interactions were described by simple two-body potentials. Test simulations showed that the dynamics of cluster bombardment transferred smoothly between the regions of the mixed resolution system. Finally, as a proof of principle, the molecular benzene system was used in simulations of energetic C60, Ar18 and Ar60 cluster bombardments to analyze the overall differences in sputtering yields and damage formation. The results from the C60 bombardment were also used in an investigation that successfully determined the relationship between C60 and Ar in cobombardment experiments. \n\nThe second objective of this dissertation is to elucidate through MD simulations the difficulties in SIMS depth profiling experiments of metal-organic interfaces. By performing C60 bombardment simulations on systems composed of varying metal overlayer thicknesses on an organic substrate, the dynamics related to the early ejection of substrate molecules along with the implantation of metal clusters in the substrate were uncovered. Results from these simulations provide a clear picture of the dynamics occurring in the SIMS depth profiling experiments.\n\nThe work presented in this dissertation is beneficial to the theoretical and experimental advancement of the SIMS field. The mixed resolution model has shown that both a reactive atomistic and coarse-grained description of a system can be used together in cluster bombardment simulations to greatly reduce their computational cost, which will enable its use in simulations to elucidate the chemical effects of cluster bombardment. For SIMS experimentalists, the simulations of the cluster bombardment of metal-organic interfaces have presented a microscopic view of the dynamics occurring during the bombardment process.

Much work has been done on PCET systems, particularly for excited state processes in which charge mobility can be easily followed using pump-probe methods.  However, while excited state PCET is utilized for the initial step of many solar energy-driven processes, including photosynthesis, ground state PCET is critical for all subsequent processes, including regeneration of solar cells.  Homogeneous ground state PCET systems are of particular interest for this regeneration, but no convenient method exists for measuring parameters governing such reactions.  Our work is directed toward understanding homogeneous ground state PCET reactions as probed using solution-phase steady-state methods.\nIn order to establish a probe for these homogeneous ground state PCET reactions, we design self-exchange model systems for PCET in analogy to classical electron transfer.  With our first model system, [Ni(2,3-pyrazinedithiol)2], we demonstrate that protonation of a mixed valence species, generating a mixed valence mixed protonated (MVMP) state, results in severe reduction of the electronic coupling intimately connected with electron transfer kinetics.  This ligand-based mixed valence molecule can be asymmetrically protonated, rendering the MVMP state.  We characterize the structural, electronic, vibrational, and magnetic properties of this complex in five different states, including the mixed valence and MVMP states, and then analyze the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) band to demonstrate a five-fold reduction in electronic coupling upon protonation.  We conclude that the reduction in electronic coupling is a result of the asymmetry of the electronic orbitals of the redox sites that results from the asymmetric protonation.  As a result, the IVCT band is established as a probe for interrogating the electronic coupling in the MVMP state, which reflects the change in the PCET potential energy landscape as a result of protonation.  This conclusion suggests that many systems designed to link electron and proton transfer will also exhibit a decrease in electronic coupling upon protonation as the strength of the interaction between redox and protonation sites is increased.\nAfter having established the MVMP state as a useful model system to study homogeneous ground state PCET, we explored structural modifications to control the communication between electron transfer and protonation sites.  These studies allow for a more fine-tuned response to protonation in a series of metal dithiolene complexes when moving from the mixed valence to the MVMP state.  We investigate the effect of changing the bridge between ligands simply by changing the metal center.  In this study, we find nearly five-fold decreases in electronic coupling for both Ni and Pt, while, for the Pd complex, the electronic coupling is reduced to the point that the IVCT band is no longer observable. We ascribe the reduction in electronic coupling to charge pinning induced by asymmetric protonation.  The more severe reduction in coupling for the Pd complex is a result of greater energetic mismatch between ligand and metal orbitals, reflected in the smaller electronic coupling for the pure mixed valence state. This work demonstrates that the bridging metal center can be used to tune the electronic coupling in both the mixed valence and MVMP states, as well as the magnitude of change of the electronic coupling that accompanies changes in protonation state.\nIn addition, we explore 2,3-quinoxalinedithiol and 2,3-pyridinedithiol ligands, which are structurally altered versions of the above dithiolene ligands in which the aromatic rings are extended and the number of ring nitrogen atoms is reduced, respectively.  With these complexes, we find that these modifications cause changes in the electronic coupling both in the mixed valence and MVMP states, and the degree of response to protonation, generating the MVMP state, is controlled as well.  For [Ni(2,3-quinoxalinedithiol)2], the only complex with the 2,3-quinoxalinedithiol ligand that reversibly generated its MVMP state, the IVCT band, and hence the electronic coupling, disappeared upon protonation.  This disappearance of electronic coupling resulted from additional electron density being placed on the ligands and not being channeled into ligand-ligand electronic coupling through the metal center.  The complex [Ni(2,3-pyridinedithiol)2] retained its IVCT band in the MVMP state, but with less electronic coupling than in the 2,3-pyrazinedithiol analogue.  This lower value of electronic coupling is a result of higher energy ligand orbitals that overlap with the metal orbitals to a lesser extent.\nLastly, we explore the [Au(2,3-pyrazinedithiol)2] complex, which is appealing for the non-innocent character of its ligands.  We report its synthesis and characterization, along with electrochemistry and spectrophotometric response to acid titration.  This molecule did not exhibit generation of its singly oxidized mixed valence species, so it does not permit direct comparison to the mixed valence species of the other metal dithiolene compounds in this study.\nUltimately, our investigations of these metal dithiolene MVMP model systems allow for more informed control over PCET self-exchange transformations, as interrogated through their IVCT bands.  The IVCT band is established as a probe for monitoring the effect of asymmetric protonation upon electronic coupling, seeking to extend classical electron transfer model systems into the domain of PCET.  The interdependence of asymmetric protonation and electron transfer will allow for better control over PCET charge mobility through structural modifications, which will allow for more rational design of systems that undergo ground state PCET in device applications.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12499], "author_name_tesi": "Kennedy, Steven Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Kennedy", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear", "Benjamin James Lear", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin James Lear, Dissertation Advisor", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Chair", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Committee Member", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mixed valence", "proton-coupled electron transfer", "mixed valence mixed protonated", "metal dithiolene", "electronic spectroscopy", "intervalence charge transfer", "solar energy", "ground state electron transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INSIGHTS INTO RETROVIRAL ASSEMBLY FROM MUTATION OF THE ROUS SARCOMA VIRUS p10 NUCLEAR EXPORT SEQUENCE", "id": "9234", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5736", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Assembly of retroviruses is mediated by a polyprotein termed Gag, which is both necessary and sufficient to drive particle assembly.  Gag functional domains are conserved among retroviruses, and each Gag protein encodes a matrix, capsid, and nucleocapsid protein that serves specific functions during particle assembly.  Numerous protein-interaction partners and conformational changes occur during the course of assembly to mediate each step of the process.  In this dissertation, I present my work on the subcellular trafficking patterns of the Gag protein of the simple avian retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) to gain insights into the role of nuclear transport mechanisms in the assembly of retroviruses.  \nRSV Gag undergoes transient nuclear localization in which nuclear export is mediated through the host cellular factor CRM1.  The nuclear trafficking step divides the assembly process into early (pre nuclear) and late (post nuclear) events.  Utilizing a complementation approach, I found that Gag proteins interact early in the assembly process, either prior to nuclear import or within the nucleus.  Under normal conditions, higher-ordered protein complex formation is prevented from occurring in the nucleus because of efficient nuclear export.  However, in the overexpression system, Gag multimers form in the nucleus when Gag is capable of interacting with RNA.  Through the use of CRM1-dependent and CRM1-independent nuclear export signal substitutions, I showed that CRM1-dependent export signals could substitute for the Gag nuclear export signal and virus assembly, although infectivity was impaired.  \nIn the course of these experiments, I made several novel observations.  In addition to the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway, RSV Gag appears to be exported from the nucleus in a CRM1-independent manner.  Furthermore, substitution of the p10 NES with heterologous NESs increased genomic RNA packaging, implicating the nuclear export sequence in Gag as a determinant for RNA incorporation.\nFinally, I showed that nuclear export activity of the Gag polyprotein can be genetically separated from the role of this region in virus replication.

In recent decades is has evolved from an obscure pursuit of naturalists into a critical tool for evaluating the ecological consequences of climate change.  Beyond simply reflecting climatic variability, phenology acts as a driver of ecological dynamics and a source of insight about an organisms\u2019 evolutionary history.  \n\nThe proximal drivers of phenology vary among species, sometimes resulting in asynchronous phenological responses to shared changes in climate.  The match/mismatch hypothesis attributes changes in reproductive success to phenological asynchrony between trophic levels when asynchrony arises during sensitive periods of a consumer/predator life history progression.  In chapter 2 I explore the genesis of this concept, review its contemporary relevance, and suggest avenues of future research that I explore in more detail in later chapters.\n\nNo global region is warming faster than the Arctic, and widespread ecological perturbations have already been documented throughout high latitudes.  Combining traditional field observations, novel phenological monitoring techniques, and data from a long-term study of tundra ecology, I examine how phenological dynamics link ecological processes across trophic levels and spatial scales in Arctic West Greenland.  In chapter 3 I test predictions about how consumer reproductive strategies and directional changes in resource phenology interact to differentially affect the reproductive performance of two Arctic ungulate species.\nSea ice loss is a broad scale abiotic driver of regional warming in the Arctic, but the indirect ecological consequences of these dynamics are poorly studied in terrestrial systems.  In chapter 4 I identify a sea ice signal in the terrestrial phenological dynamics of plant phenology and herbivore reproductive performance.  These findings suggest sea ice loss may have more wide reaching impacts on terrestrial Arctic ecology than are currently appreciated.  \n\nSpatial patterns of phenological dynamics are relevant to ecological processes across multiple spatial scales, but often information on plant phenology is derived solely from localized vegetation plots or broad scale satellite derived metrics.

I do so using a novel quantitative dataset derived from a network of time-lapse cameras distributed across the focal tundra landscape.

These 16 employees attended three workshops in State College during the 2006-2007 academic year.  The program was evaluated through participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and phenomenological interviews to discover the experience of the participants.  The interviews explored attitudes, perceptions, and receptivity of the participants using Collaborative Learning in a natural resources context and addressed Collaborative Learning\u2019s practicality in changing interactions with private forestland stakeholders and addressing other natural resource issues.  \nInterview analysis highlighted three categorical themes that describe participant experience with Collaborative Learning: direct outcomes of the Collaborative Learning workshops, the agency reflections, and facilitating in a Collaborative Learning way.

The participants in these learning communities are the students and the teacher in individual classrooms. These participants contribute to scientific discourse about a specific content area under study. Scientific learning communities, on the other hand, long ago moved beyond the confines of a laboratory, meeting room or any one physical location. Scientists engage in ongoing discourse with many members of the scientific community in different locations all over the world. These same technological advances can now be used by science teachers and students to venture out of their classroom and become involved in a global learning community (GLC).\n\tThe context of this study, From Local to Extreme Environments (FLEXE), is a science curriculum that attempts to expand the boundaries of the science classroom and involve students in a GLC. FLEXE participants are not limited to conversations with students and a teacher in one classroom. Students and teachers in many classrooms in multiple countries, deep-sea scientists, and university education researchers are involved in the FLEXE community. \n\tThis study was framed by theories of sociocultural learning, discourse and learning communities. These theoretical research perspectives acted as lenses for the examination of communication of student participants in a GLC. Student views of their collaboration and their scientific writing were studied within a principle contrast of U.S. students in domestic or international class partnerships. A mixed methods approach was used to study the GLC established in the FLEXE program. Statistical analyses were used with \u201cquick questions\u201d (QQs) that follow each online session, in order to characterize students\u2019 views of the online global learning environment. Argumentation analysis was used to examine and compare how students supported their scientific claims with a number of different data sources. Classroom visits and communication with teachers throughout the unit helped to characterize the enactment of the instructional unit.\n\tTrends in the findings of the analyses all point to favorable results for international class partnerships over domestic U.S. partnerships. U.S. students in international partnerships were more excited about their partnership and wrote more accurate scientific claims that they supported with more evidence. These students specifically included more uses of the evidentiary discourse components contrast, causality, and experience discourse components.\n\tThe findings from this study add to knowledge about learning communities, written scientific argumentation analysis, and students\u2019 views of class partnerships. The findings also have direct implications for classroom practice. Global science education has the possibility to have bold impacts on the structure and discourse of science education. Many features of science education should now be reconsidered, including the curriculum, assessments, student discourse, and interaction with scientists. We live in a global society that includes a global economy, multicultural and multi-national relationships, and comparisons of educational achievements between countries.

Pavement structure typically consists of an asphalt concrete or concrete surface layer, underlying granular layers (subbase and/or base), and a compacted subgrade soil layer. As the subgrade is saturated during wet seasons, cyclic loading caused by heavy traffic may lead to pumping of fine particles from the subgrade into the granular layers. Additionally, in rigid pavements, the repeated traffic loading may also result in redistribution of materials underneath the slabs, which contributes to faulting of rigid pavement slabs. Pumping of fines negatively impacts the performance and service life of the pavement and ultimately may lead to failure. The main objectives of this research are to (1) investigate occurrence of migration of fines and simulate and quantify the magnitude and rate of such migration in both flexible and rigid pavements and for different classes of roadways, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of geotextiles as a separation and filtration layer in preventing subgrade fines migration, and (3) understand the mechanisms of fines migration in pavement and provide a reasonable prediction of the amount of fines migration using a numerical model on particle transport in porous media.\n\nThe cyclic traffic loading is simulated on geometrically-scaled models of flexible and rigid pavements representing a typical collector road and interstate highways using a one-third-scale Model Mobile Load Simulator (MMLS3), an accelerated pavement testing (APT) device. The pavement sections are constructed on partially saturated aggregate subbase overlying non-plastic saturated silt as subgrade. To evaluate the effectiveness of geotextile separation and filtration in reducing subgrade fines migration, identical tests simulating flexible collector road and rigid interstate highway are repeated, except that a geotextile layer is placed at the interface of subgrade and subbase layers. The results obtained from the tests with and without geotextile separator layer are then compared. The lab testing reveals that, under repeated traffic loading, a significant amount of fines migrated into the subbase. More migration occurs in the simulated collector road than in the interstate highway. The subgrade fines migration in mass percentage increases with the simulated traffic loading cycles. The resulting gradation of subbase also varies with the depth in the subbase, with more fines deposited in the lower section (closer to the subgrade) than in the upper section of the subbase. In the jointed rigid pavement, more fines accumulated in the subbase beneath the approach slab than beneath the leave slab, confirming that migration of fines counter to the direction of traffic occurs when the load moves to the leave slab. A geotextile separation layer at the subgrade-subbase interface can be used as an effective means to reduce pumping of subgrade fines in pavement by providing both separation and filtration. \n\nFinally, a numerical model is formulated to understand the mechanisms of particle transport in pavement and to provide a reasonable prediction of the amount of fines migration in pavement. The model is verified using the results from the scaled pavement testing conducted on flexible pavements to quantify the magnitude and rate of subgrade fines migration. The numerical study suggests that the deposition of the subgrade soil into subbase is governed by hydraulic condition, grain size of subgrade, grain size and pore size of subbase, permeability of subbase, and viscosity of pore fluid in the subbase. Moreover, magnitude and duration of applied load play a leading role in the amount of pumping in pavement, as also revealed in the experimental study.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16892], "author_name_tesi": "Kermani, Behnoud ", "last_name_ssi": "Kermani", "first_name_ssi": "Behnoud", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels & Ming Xiao", "Shelley Marie Stoffels & Ming Xiao", "Tong Qiu", "Shimin Liu", "Shimin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels & Ming Xiao, Dissertation Advisor", "Shelley Marie Stoffels & Ming Xiao, Committee Chair", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member", "Shimin Liu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cyclic loading; Faulting; Flexible pavement; Geosynthetics; Geotextiles; MMLS3; Particle transport; Pore water pressure; Pumping; Rigid pavement; Rutting; Subgrade fines migration; Traffic loading"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "SIMULATIONS OF GRANULAR COLUMN COLLAPSE USING SMOOTHED PARTICLE HYDRODYNAMICS AND DISCRETE ELEMENT METHODS", "id": "15103euk158", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15103", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Granular materials are an inseparable part of daily life. Granular flow is commonly encountered in nature (e.g., landslides, debris avalanches, active movement of retaining walls) and various industrial and engineering processes (e.g., hopper flow, conveyer belts, silo discharge). Granular material may exhibit both solid-like and fluid-like behaviors and due to this complexity, understanding of the behavior of granular materials under different flow conditions is of great importance and has been the subject of various experimental and numerical studies in recent years. Interesting cases of granular flow are dynamic (i.e. rapid) and quasi-static (i.e. slow) collapses of granular columns, which are relevant to landslides and active movement of retaining walls in geotechnical engineering, respectively, and provide invaluable insights into the mechanics of unsteady dense granular flow.\nIn this research, two numerical simulation techniques including Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method from continuum framework and Discrete Element Method (DEM) from discrete framework have been employed to model three-dimensional (3D) quasi-static and dynamic collapses of cylindrical and rectangular granular columns and the transitional regime between quasi-static and dynamic collapses. The developed 3D models are initially validated against available experimental observations and are later used to provide better understandings of the collapse mechanisms including collapse pattern, deposit morphology, energy dissipations, non-deformed region, etc.\nResults of the developed SPH and DEM models reveal that both continuum and discrete frameworks are qualitatively and quantitatively capable of capturing different aspects of granular collapse as long as appropriate constitutive models or contact behaviors are implemented. However, DEM simulations are better capable of capturing particle-level behaviors, such as the sharp edges of the free surface and flow front.\nResults of the developed 3D SPH and DEM models under different flow conditions show that quasi-static collapse is qualitatively similar to the dynamic collapse, with final profile height, runout distance, collapse pattern, and energy dissipation mainly depending on the initial aspect ratio of the columns. However, the quasi-static collapse results in shorter runout distances and less granular material distortion. It is also observed that transition between quasi-static and dynamic collapses occurs within a small range of Midi numbers. Furthermore, the developed models are used to conduct a parametric study on the effects of microscopic and macroscopic material properties (e.g., density, friction, rotational resistance and porosity) on flow behavior. For quasi-static granular column collapse, theoretical equations for final height, runout distance and energy dissipations for two conceptual cases (i.e., truncated cone-like/truncated wedge-like deposits for small aspect ratios and cone-like/wedge-like deposits for large aspect ratios) are derived, and it is shown that results of these equations are in good agreement with SPH and DEM simulations and experimental observations. \nThe dissertation also presents the results of SPH simulation of flow of water through non-deformable porous media, which can be considered as the first stage of developing a fully coupled SPH-DEM model to comprehensively study the flow of water through soil. The developed models are validated against the results of available numerical studies in the literature and an experimental study which was conducted as a part of this research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16640], "author_name_tesi": "Kermani, Elnaz ", "last_name_ssi": "Kermani", "first_name_ssi": "Elnaz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tong Qiu", "Tong Qiu", "Ming Xiao", "Shimin Liu", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tong Qiu, Dissertation Advisor", "Tong Qiu, Committee Chair", "Ming Xiao, Committee Member", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Discrete Element Method", "Dynamic Collapse", "Energy Dissipation", "Granular Flow", "Quasi-Static Collapse", "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Kinetics of ozone reaction with low-molecular weight antioxidants at physiologically relevant conditions\n\n\n", "id": "7479", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6070", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ozone (O3), a major component of photochemical smog is a highly reactive gas that causes a decrement in lung function and lung inflammation upon inhalation. Respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) contains natural antioxidants such as uric acid (UA), ascorbic acid (AH2), and glutathione (GSH) that protect the underlying epithelium from toxic gases such as O3. The purpose of this study was to better understand and quantify the reaction kinetics between O3 and these antioxidants under conditions that are similar to those encountered when polluted air is inhaled into the respiratory system. To achieve this objective, we developed a semibatch reactor in which a 300 to 800 ml/min flow of air containing 1-5 parts per million by volume (ppm) of O3 contacted 3 ml of a well-stirred test solution.  The concentration of O3 at the outlet of the reactor and the concentration of antioxidant in the aqueous solution were measured at reaction times of 5, 10 and 15 minutes, allowing the simultaneous determination of O3 absorbed and antioxidant consumed.   \nData was collected on test solutions consisting of single-component, binary and ternary mixtures of 50-200 &#956;M UA, AH2 and GSH.  Kinetic parameters were determined using a mathematical model in which the squared-error between the observed amounts of O3 absorbed and antioxidant consumed and their simulated values was minimized.  The results obtained in single-component solutions of the antioxidants indicated that:  1) mass transfer resistances in the gas and liquid phases were negligible; 2) the reaction of O3 with UA or with AH2 has a one-to-one (1:1) stoichiometry; 3) the reaction of O3 with GSH has a 1:2.5 stoichiometry; and 4) the reactivity between O3 and these antioxidants is in the following order: UA &#61627; AH2 > GSH.  The rate constants estimated from these data for O3 reaction with UA, AH2, and GSH were  ,  and  , respectively. Comparing the previous studies with the current investigation indicates: 1) with the exception of one study, all the previously-reported rate constants of UA and AH2 with O3 are two to three orders of magnitude larger than our values; 2) all the reported data agree with our conclusion that the reaction of O3 with UA or with AH2 is first-order with respect to O3, as well as the antioxidant; 3) our study is the only one that provides clear evidence of a non-first-order reaction between O3 and GSH.\nFor binary and ternary mixtures of the antioxidants, we found that: 1) the consumption of UA and AH2 are decreased in the presence of one another.  Numerical simulations verified that this protective effect is mostly due to the competitive reaction of UA and AH2 toward O3;   2) both UA and AH2 can attenuate the consumption of GSH in the binary mixtures whereas GSH does not have the same effect on UA and AH2. It was necessary to employ an interaction parameter in the numerical simulation in order to account for this; and 3) the presence of UA and AH2 simultaneously in the mixture also diminished GSH consumption.\nWe also studied the kinetics of reaction between O3 and albumin. Concentrations of tryptophan residues in albumin ranged from 6 to 20 \u00b5M. By employing a procedure similar to the one used for the antioxidants we found a stoichiometry of 1.5:1.0 and an optimal rate constant of   for reaction between O3 and a tryptophan residue in albumin. The effectiveness of GSH for protecting tryptophan groups from O3 oxidation was examined in binary solutions of GSH and albumin. The Concentrations of GSH in the solutions ranged from 0 to 200 \u00b5M, whereas equivalent tryptophan concentrations were varied from 0 to 20 \u00b5M. The results indicated that GSH and tryptophan groups can attenuate the consumption of one other. However, the changes in GSH consumption caused by tryptophan residues were not as drastic as the changes in tryptophan consumption caused by GSH. Therefore, GSH is more effective in protecting tryptophan residues in albumin from O3 oxidation than tryptophan groups are in inhibiting GSH reaction.\nFinally, we studied the reaction of O3 with nasal lavage samples obtained from healthy human subjects.  The results indicated that:  1) approximately 50% of the total O3 absorption in nasal lavage is due to UA. This demonstrates that UA is an effective scavenger of ozone; and 2) half of the UA is spared by other substrates such as albumin and mucin that successfully compete for half of the O3 with a non-unity stoichiometry.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6062], "author_name_tesi": "Kermani, Sanaz ", "last_name_ssi": "Kermani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sanaz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James S Ultman", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria", "Ali Borhan", "Michael Pishko", "Anne M Andrews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James S Ultman, Committee Chair", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Michael Pishko, Committee Member", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["air pollution", "antioxidant reaction kinetics", "Respiratory antioxidants", "inhalation toxicology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Spatialization in Selected Works of Iannis Xenakis", "id": "17586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8582", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe intersection between music and architecture in the work of Iannis Xenakis (1922\u20132001) is practically inseparable due to his training as an architect, engineer, and composer.

In the 1960s, Xenakis began composing music that included spatial aspects\u2014music in which movement is an integral part of the work.

In Eonta, the brass players actually walk around on stage and modify the position of their instruments to create spatial effects.

In this research the AMC consists of a frequency selective surface placed above a PEC ground plane, with a dielectric material in between.  Such a structure can be modeled as a parallel L-C circuit, which gives rise to a resonant frequency at which the surface impedance of the AMC becomes quite large.  \nOne method for increasing the bandwidth is the use of an active load, in this case a negative impedance converter, to change the inductance and capacitance of the structure.  Additionally, the use of magnetic materials within the substrate also allows for a small increase in operating bandwidth for all resonances of multi-band AMCs.  Tunable AMC surfaces are also realized by means of an electrically tunable, high dielectric substrate material, as well as incorporating mechanical switches as part of the FSS geometry to provide tunable performance for different screen geometries.  \nA unique application of AMC surfaces is the equivalence between a high impedance AMC structure and a magnetic substrate backed by a PEC ground plane.  The resulting structure is called a metaferrite and can be optimized, much like a conventional AMC, to achieve a desired magnetic permittivity for one or more frequencies for use as lightweight, thin absorbers for electromagnetic radiation.  \nFurther research into metasurfaces resulted in the ability to design a matched impedance metamaterial to act as a magneto-dielectric substrate without using magnetic materials.  The metamaterial is GA optimized to obtain an equivalent low-loss dielectric and magnetic constant.  The primary application of this magneto-dielectric metastructure is to reduce the aperture size without negatively impacting antenna operating bandwidth.  Since no magnetic materials are used in this metastructure, a thin, lightweight, low-profile antenna system can be developed. \nFinally, the combination of electromagnetic bandgap AMC surfaces and low-profile antennas will be examined to obtain improved antenna performance over the desired frequency band.  The optimized result is an antenna system that achieves improved realized gain compared to the conventional antenna alone.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1414], "author_name_tesi": "Kern, Douglas John", "last_name_ssi": "Kern", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Pingjuan Li Werner", "Kultegin Aydin", "Milton Walter Cole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["frequency selective surfaces", "metamaterials", "artificial magnetic conductors", "antennas", "negative impedance converters", "electromagnetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Intersection of Multiple Focal Climates: Safety Climate and Service Climate in a Healthcare Context\n", "id": "11784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2702", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study examines the impact of multiple focal climates operating simultaneously in a single organization.

Some researchers and theorists contend that nontraditional students need to be taught differently from traditional-age college students utilizing a more independent, self-directed mode of instruction that takes their prior life and work experiences into account and that educators in higher education need to modify conditions to better serve nontraditional students. Researchers have suggested that the classroom experience is the focal point of the adult student\u2019s learning experience. Indeed, classrooms are spaces where learners make meaning of their experiences and ideas in multiple ways: through individual reflection on reading and/or lecture, through social interaction with facilitators and other learners, and through various experiential learning opportunities. Therefore, knowing the learning preferences of adult students and how they make meaning of their new learning experiences is important to adult educators. \n\tThe purpose of this study was to explore the learning preferences of adult community college students from diverse backgrounds and how they construct new meanings out of their educational experiences in the classroom. This qualitative social constructivist study extends the existing learning preferences literature by providing depth through interviews of participants, designed to learn of their preferences in their own words. It also provides insight into the reasons behind their stated preferences and the meaning of their new learning in light of both individual preferences and the social context of the higher education classroom. A diverse group of students was selected in order to determine how learning preferences differ based on participants\u2019 positionality and to learn the meanings diverse students place on their classroom experiences from among those who have actually experienced a variety of teaching approaches in the higher education classroom. This study employed a qualitative social constructivist design to learn of adult students\u2019 learning preferences. The researcher conducted 18 individual interviews and 2 focus groups with a total of 12 students who were students or had recently been students in the business division of a community college.

These small satellites are revolutionizing the space industry, but their general lack of propulsion options limit their operational capabilities.  Previous research at Penn State into the use of additive manufacturing to create an integrated hybrid propulsion unit for CubeSats showed promise, but material limitations eliminated the possibility of using the polymer materials investigated.  \nIn this work, development of an additively manufactured propulsion unit for CubeSats was continued with the goal of creating a metal design.  Estimations of performance parameters for the proposed propulsion unit were made using previous work, basic orbital mechanics, and computer models.  Initial estimates indicated the propulsion unit could provide 160 m/s of velocity change to a 3U CubeSat weighing approximately 5 kg.  Feasibility studies conducted using these performance parameters showed that an integrated hybrid propulsion unit for CubeSats can enable significant orbital maneuverability without the cost and hazards associated with the sparse market alternatives.  Specifically, models suggest that the propulsive capability enabled by the propulsion unit can extend the lifetime of a 3U CubeSat deployed from the International Space Station from a number of months to a number of years.  Based on the positive results of the feasibility study, a titanium hybrid propulsion unit for CubeSats was subsequently designed, additively manufactured, and tested through a series of pressure, leak, and hot-fire tests.  The propulsion unit was designed to utilize paraffin-based grains and nitrous oxide as the fuel and oxidizer, respectively.  \nThe printed propulsion unit, with a mass of 550g, showed some minor deformations from the manufacturing process that were corrected using post processing or accounted for in the design of subsequent tests.  Pressure and leak testing verified that the oxidizer tank could withstand high pressures and that the additively manufactured pressure vessel did not leak at expected operating pressures.  A specialized nozzle assembly was designed and manufactured to withstand the extreme conditions of a hot-fire test.  The propulsion unit was designed to take standardized 1.5\u201d diameter, 2.5\u201d long fuel grain cartridges.  Hot-fire testing demonstrated the propulsion unit in a laboratory environment, satisfying the conditions necessary to bring the propulsion unit to Technology Readiness Level 4.  A unique fuel grain geometry featuring a length of straight port paraffin with a downstream ABS diaphragm and mixing section was used and characterized during the hot-fire tests.  Initial calculations suggest these fuel grains achieved a c* combustion efficiency of around 0.60-0.80, reflecting relatively high performance for such short fuel grains.  Recommendations for future work necessary to advance the propulsion unit to Technology Readiness Level 6 (component demonstration in a relevant environment) were made based on the knowledge gained in this research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16917], "author_name_tesi": "Kerr, Evan M", "last_name_ssi": "Kerr", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Michael Matthew Micci", "Amy Ruth Pritchett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Matthew Micci, Thesis Advisor", "Amy Ruth Pritchett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CubeSat", "Propulsion unit", "hybrid rocket", "additive manufacturing", "powder bed fusion", "direct metal laser sintering", "DMLS", "PBF"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE SIGINIFICANCE OF MODEL STRUCTURE IN ONE-DIMENSIONAL STREAM SOLUTE TRANSPORT MODELS WITH MULTIPLE TRANSIENT STORAGE ZONES\n\n", "id": "12471", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4864", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transient storage models are used to simulate solute transport in streams. The processes characterized and the parameters interpreted from these models are important to our understanding of biogeochemical cycling. Single storage zone (1-SZ) models lump portions of the stream with different biogeochemical and hydrodynamic characteristics into one zone. Recent progress has been made to develop transient storage zone models with two-storage zones (2-SZ) to discriminate between surface and subsurface (hyporheic) exchange. Surface transient storage (STS) is the non-advective portion of channels that surround and sometimes divide the main channel, while hyporheic transient storage (HTS) is the wetted subsurface area adjacent to the stream. These storage zones are subject to different physical and biogeochemical conditions. Thus, to advance biogeochemical models, we want to separate the effects of these storage zones. In models with multiple transient storage zones, each storage zone can exchange with the stream, another storage zone, or both. In a competing model structure both zones are connected to the stream at the same location and the stream interacts with the STS and HTS separately; whereas in a nested model structure the STS interacts directly with the stream and the HTS interacts only with the STS. Residence time metrics used to compare single transient storage models were adapted for use with the competing and nested 2-SZ models and are model-structure based. We investigated the transient storage characteristics of a 460-m reach of Laurel Run, a first-order stream in central Pennsylvania, using a 1-SZ, nested 2-SZ, and competing 2-SZ model configurations. This study modeled the solute breakthrough curves from three salt tracer experiments ranging from high to low flows and compared the results. Results show that both the competing and nested 2-SZ models\niv\nmay accurately simulate the BTCs obtained in the STS and main channel. The calibrated model parameters differ for the three model structures, and therefore so does the interpretation of associated transient storage metrics. The new 2-SZ metrics were applied to this data and the results suggest that the interpretation of transient storage processes and its relationship with biogeochemical cycling processes is dependent on model structure.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4841, 4842], "author_name_tesi": "Kerr, Patrick Corbitt", "last_name_ssi": "Kerr", "middle_name_ssi": "Corbitt", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mike Gooseff", "Michael N Gooseff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mike Gooseff, Thesis Advisor", "Michael N Gooseff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["transient storage", "modeling", "hyporheic", "stream"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Developments in Acoustic Metamaterials for Acoustic Ground Cloaks", "id": "14779pak215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14779", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of acoustic cloaking is to eliminate both the back scattered and forward scattered acoustic fields by redirecting the incident wave around an object. Acoustic ground cloaks, which conceal an object on a rigid reflecting surface, utilize a linear coordinate transformation to map the flat surface to a void by compressing space into two cloaking regions consisting of a homogeneous anisotropic acoustic metafluid. Transformation acoustics allows for the realization of a coordinate transformation through a reinterpretation of the scale factors as a new material in the original coordinate system. Previous work has demonstrated at least three types of unit cells exhibit homogeneous anisotropic mass density and homogeneous isotropic bulk modulus: alternating layers of homogeneous isotropic fluids, perforated plates and solid inclusions. The primary focus of this dissertation is to demonstrate underwater anisotropic mass density with a solid inclusion unit cell and realize an underwater perforated plate acoustic ground cloak. \n\nAn in depth analysis into the methods used to characterize the effective material parameters of solid inclusion unit cells with water as the background fluid was performed for both single inclusion unit cells as well as multi-inclusion unit cells. The degree of density anisotropy obtainable for a rigid single inclusion unit cell is limited by the size of the inclusion. However, a greater degree of anisotropy can be achieved by introducing additional inclusions into the unit cell design. For example, including a foam material that is less dense than the background fluid, results in an anisotropic density tensor with one component greater than and one component less than the value of the background fluid. The results of a parametric study determined that for a multi-inclusion unit cell, the effective material parameters can be controlled by the dimensions of the rigid inclusion as well as the material parameters and dimensions of the foam inclusions.\n\nNon-destructive acoustic excitation techniques were used to extract the material parameters of different grades of foam to identify the ideal grade for use in a multi-inclusion unit cell. Single inclusion and multi-inclusion bulk metamaterial samples were constructed and tested to characterize the effective material properties to determine if they exhibited the desired homogeneous anisotropic behavior. The single steel inclusion metamaterial behaved as expected, demonstrating anisotropic mass density and isotropic bulk modulus. Almost no sound energy was transmitted through the multi-inclusion metamaterial, contrary to expectation, because of the presence of air bubbles, both on the surface of the foam as well as potentially in between the inclusions. \n\nFinally, an underwater acoustic ground cloak was constructed from perforated steel plates and experimentally tested to conceal an object on a pressure release surface. The perforated plate acoustic ground cloak successfully cloaked the scattered object over a broad frequency range of 7 [kHz] to 12 [kHz]. There was excellent agreement between the phase of the surface reflection and the cloak reflection with a small amplitude difference attributed to the difference between a water - air and a water - mylar - air boundary. Above 15 [kHz], the cloaking performance decreased as the effective material parameters of the perforated plate metamaterial deviated from the required material parameters.

As a result, players' perceptions might not be favorable for a well performing driver because they found the radiated sound unsatisfactory. Because of the importance of the sound produced when a driver impacts a golf ball, this work attempted to correlate the radiated sound from the ball/driver impact with the vibrational mode shapes of the driver. The six drivers studied in this work consisted of both new and old models that, based on anecdotal evidence from player reviews, ranged from being annoyingly loud to muted and dull. A roving impact hammer test was used to measure the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the three clubhead components: face, crown, and sole. Modal frequencies and mode shapes were extracted from the FRFs using the commercial software package STAR Modal. The first modal frequency of the sole was found around 2000 Hz which is below the \"trampoline\" effects of the face (~ 4500 Hz). Frequency limitations of the interaction between the impact hammer and the crown prompted Scanning Laser Doppler Vibrometry measurements to obtain operating deflection shapes for high frequency modes. Similar patterns were seen in both the mode shapes and operating deflection shapes. Recordings of the radiated impact sound were made at an outdoor driving range. In order to determine how the sound changed when the impact location was not \"dead center,\" sound recordings were made for each of the six drivers with a minimum of two ball strikes at three impact locations on the club face: center face, off center toward the toe, and off center toward the sole. Power spectral densities were calculated from a microphone that duplicated the relative location of the ball compared to the golfer's ear. Significant changes were seen in the spectra for different impact locations as well as overall amplitude for clubs perceived as loud verses dull. The frequencies of the peaks in the sound spectra were correlated to the frequencies of the mode shapes and operating deflection shapes allowing for matching which club vibrations were responsible for the sound the club makes when impacting a golf ball. For each club, there were mode shapes with frequencies very close to the peaks in the sound spectra. The clubs perceived as loud and annoying exhibited a dominant feature in the spectrum of high amplitude pure tones in the frequency range of 2kHz - 4kHz, frequencies associated with mode shapes involving the sole and crown. In contrast, the clubs perceived as muted and dull had spectral amplitudes that were roughly two orders of magnitude lower than the other clubs. Additionally, the spectra for these clubs were not defined by any single dominant feature. As expected, the contributions of peaks associated with face plate modes changed with the impact location of the ball.

Most of the craters formed are not erased with time due to lack of \"weathering\" processes such as no atmosphere and little erosion.  The main focus of this research is to develop ground-based observational techniques to search for ongoing hypervelocity meteoroid impacts on the lunar surface. Additionally, to design radar observational techniques to detect and map sub-surface structures that have been buried by the lunar regolith.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the developing, optically-dense hot ejecta cloud associated with the hypervelocity meteoroid impacts produce an associated complex plasma component that rapidly evolves resulting in a highly-transient Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) in the VHF/UHF spectral region. An observational EMP search was conducted in May 2014 for about 5 hours using an overlapping-band (425-445 MHz) at the Arecibo (AO; Puerto Rico) and Haystack-(HO, Massachusetts, USA) observatories simultaneously to track the common visible lunar surface from two different locations on the Earth. Observations from two locations is helpful in eliminating the false impacts. Interleaved radar observations were used to calibrate the timing and synchronize both the AO and HO systems. \n\nAs the AO/HO UHF EMP search was interference dominated, an alternative search mechanism using the Arecibo L-band ALFA Array that consists of seven beams arranged in the hexagonal manner was conducted in February 2016. During these observations, at any given time few of the receive-beams were on-Moon and few off-Moon thus allowing discrimination against local interference that might resemble the expected EMP signals. While still encountering local out-of-band radar interference, this observational paradigm did yield a few likely lunar impact EMPs.\n\nAdditionally, to detect the sub-surface lunar structures, high power large aperture - Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) 50 MHz radar located near Lima, Peru was used to map the lunar surface and subsurface features. This was accomplished by developing or refining various calibration and imaging procedures. This radar provides the ability to map the lunar sub-surface because the 6-meter wavelength radar signal penetrates the low-loss regolith and scatters from larger sub-surface structures allowing study of these structures. This analysis further depends on the (de)polarization of the return signals. Interpretation of lunar radar signal polarization is greatly complicated by the double traverse of the ionosphere at or near wavevector near to perpendicular to the geomagnetic field geometry as described. Preliminary radar observations were conducted in October 2015 by transmitting a circular polarized coded pulse during the lunar transit over JRO.

The detailed analysis of the asymptotic structure of the gravitational field,\nwhich constitutes the framework of asymptotic flatness, lays the foundation for research in diverse areas in gravitational science. However, the framework is incomplete in two respects. First, asymptotic flatness provides well-defined expressions for physical observables such as energy and momentum as `charges' of asymptotic symmetries at null infinity, $\\scri^+$.  But the asymptotic symmetry group, called the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group is infinite-dimensional and a tensorial expression for the `charge' integral of an arbitrary BMS element is missing. We address this issue by providing a charge formula which \nis a 2-sphere integral over fields local to the 2-sphere and refers to no extraneous structure.\n\nThe second, and more significant shortcoming is that observations have established that $\\Lambda$ is not zero but positive in our universe. Can the framework describing isolated systems and their gravitational radiation be extended to incorporate this fact? In this dissertation we show that, unfortunately, \nthe standard framework does not extend from the $\\Lambda =0$ case to the $\\Lambda >0$ case in a physically useful manner. In particular, we do not have an invariant notion of gravitational waves in the non-linear regime, nor an analog of the Bondi `news tensor', nor positive energy theorems. In addition, we argue that the stronger boundary condition of conformal flatness of intrinsic metric on $\\scri^+$, which reduces the asymptotic symmetry group from $\\Diff$ to the de Sitter group, is insufficient to characterize gravitational fluxes and is physically unreasonable.\n\nTo obtain guidance for the full non-linear theory with $\\Lambda > 0$, linearized gravitational waves in de Sitter space-time are analyzed in detail. i) We show explicitly that conformal flatness of the boundary removes half the degrees of freedom of the gravitational field by hand and is not justified by physical considerations; ii) We obtain gauge invariant expressions of energy-momentum and angular momentum fluxes carried by gravitational waves in terms of fields defined at $\\scrip$; iii) We demonstrate that the flux formulas reduce to the familiar ones in Minkowski space-time in spite of the fact that the limit $\\Lambda \\to 0$ is discontinuous (since, in particular, $\\scrip$ changes its space-like character to null in the limit); iv) We obtain a generalization of Einstein's 1918 quadrupole formula for power emission by a linearized source to include a positive $\\Lambda$; and, finally v) We show that, although energy of linearized gravitational waves can be arbitrarily negative in general, gravitational waves emitted by physically reasonable sources carry positive energy.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12067], "author_name_tesi": "Kesavan, Aruna ", "last_name_ssi": "Kesavan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aruna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera", "Eugenio Bianchi", "Steinn Sigurdsson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Dissertation Advisor", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Committee Chair", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera, Committee Member", "Eugenio Bianchi, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Asymptotics", "Dark Energy", "Gravitational Radiation", "Cosmological Constant"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "OZONE TRANSPORT AND UPTAKE IN\nANATOMICALLY-ACCURATE MODELS OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT\n", "id": "11826", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "863", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas and a harmful air pollutant. A reproducible pattern of tissue injury induced by inhalation of O3 is believed to depend on the local dose delivered to the airway walls. To predict the local dose, we performed\nnumerical simulations of ozone transport and uptake during inhalation in an anatomically-accurate geometrical model of the respiratory tract of a Rhesus monkey. The model geometry was created using three-dimensional reconstruction\nof MRI images of the respiratory tract, including the nasal passages, the larynx, and the first thirteen generations originating from the right bronchus. An unstructured mesh was generated for the resulting structure, and three-dimensional\nflow and concentration distributions were obtained through numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes, continuity, and species convection-diffusion equations. A quasi-steady diffusion-reaction model was used to account for the interaction between O3 and endogenous substrates in the respiratory tract lining fluid.\n\nThe total rate of O3 uptake within each section of the respiratory tract was determined, and hot spots of O3 flux on the airway walls were identified. Hot spots of wall flux within the tracheobronchial tree are found to occur near the\ninlet of the trachea where the laryngeal jet impinges on the trachea wall, and at the bifurcations (especially the first bifurcation). The simulation results show that the structure of the upper airways has a significant effect on the distribution of ozone flux on the airway walls, by producing additional hot spots of ozone flux\nupstream of the trachea in the nasal vestibule, the dorsal and ventral parts of the middle turbinate, the medial part of the inferior turbinate, the ventral part of the inferior meatus, the medial part of the nasopharynx, and the larynx. In addition, the presence of the larynx leads to a more uniform wall flux distribution within the trachea, compared to the corresponding simulations in the same airway structure without the larynx.\n\nResults of the three-dimensional simulations for ozone uptake along a single asymmetrically-branched airway path were also compared to the predictions of an axisymmetric single-path model. The axisymmetric model consisted of a series\nof tubular airway branches of decreasing cross-sectional area connected through leakage zones that emulated the flow split at each bifurcation. The dimensions of this path were determined from three-dimensional reconstruction of the actual\nairway structure. Single-path simulations of gas uptake were found to be comparable to the predictions of the more realistic (but more computationally-intensive) three-dimensional simulations. The effect of different boundary conditions imposed at the outflow boundaries were also examined. It was found that a simpler and less costly truncated geometry of the tracheobronchial tree can be used in the\nsimulations to accurately predict ozone uptake and wall flux, provided that the flow distribution at the outflow boundaries of the truncated geometry is based on the total cross-sectional area of all of their downstream outflows in the complete geometry of the tracheobronchial tree.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [856], "author_name_tesi": "Keshavarzi, Banafsheh ", "last_name_ssi": "Keshavarzi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Banafsheh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Borhan", "Ali Borhan", "James S Ultman", "Michael John Janik", "Rebecca Bascom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Borhan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Borhan, Committee Chair", "James S Ultman, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Rebecca Bascom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Respiratory fluid dynamics", "Dosimetry modeling", "Ozone", "Computational fluid dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Dynamics and Dimensional Similitude of Vehicle Impacts upon Soil-fixed Boulders in Cohesionless Soil", "id": "15487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7319", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes development and application of a 2-D low-order model, scaling laws, and dimensionless equations of motion (DEOM) for a vehicle impact upon a soil-fixed boulder in cohesionless soil.

The low-order model has three degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), which are the linear translation of the vehicle and boulder and the angle of rotation of the boulder.\n\nThe low-order model is used to simulate a vehicle impact on a soil-fixed boulder using numerical integration techniques.  The simulation is then compared and validated against past full scale crash tests.  All full scale crashes were performed according to ASTM F2656-07 at an M30 rating using a 6,800 kg (15,000 lb.) medium-duty sized truck.

In addition, the factors that influence social studies preservice teachers\u2019 use of computer technology will be explored and described.\nThe value of this study lies in three areas: 1) Growing interest technology\u2019s use in classrooms and limited research illustrate the importance of examining integration of information technology as teaching and learning tools on the attitudes and practices of preservice teachers.  2) Adding to the body of knowledge in preservice teacher education and information technology integration is important for methods courses.  3) And, the prescriptive findings of this research provide an effective model for integrating information technology in social studies teacher education.\nData consisted of observations, interviews, surveys, informal conversations, and email communications. Twenty-eight preservice teachers were given a survey that asked how often they use computer technology, how familiar they are with computer technology, and what they think about the place of computer technology in social studies education. From these survey results, eight preservice teachers were chosen to participate in in-depth interviews.\nThis study\u2019s findings confirm that conducting new research regarding the place of computer technologies in social studies education, especially, in preservice teachers\u2019 education is necessary to understand current situation in the use of computer technologies in social studies education.

As exemplified, social studies preservice teachers\u2019 computer technology backgrounds, and experiences and problems with computer technologies has changed over the years and using ten years old research as a basis for improving teacher education programs or to making new policies could pose extra problems instead of offering solutions. Therefore, all social studies research should conduct more investigations regarding social studies preservice teachers\u2019 perceptions and attitudes toward computer technologies before taking any further steps in social studies teacher education programs. Also supported by the data is that universities could reorganize their social studies education programs for more effective methods courses designed to enhance the use of computer technologies in social studies education.

In early stages of reservoir depletion, it is often a challenging task to accurately determine reservoir properties that are representative of the actual field. Reservoir modeling is the traditional way that engineers performed to develop field development and depletion plans. Due to different scales of data obtained from various sources like seismic data, well logs, cores, and production data, there is a lot of uncertainty in solving the inverse problem of estimating formation rock and fluid properties from the field data. Increase in complexity of formations and scarcity of reservoir data have made reservoir characterization a challenging task. Soft computing techniques have gained popularity in petroleum industry to identify complex patterns that exist between various reservoir data collected from multiple sources and be able to successfully characterize a reservoir.\nIn this work, a work-flow is developed for devising a comprehensive reservoir characterization tool based on artificial neural network. A case study of Chevron\u2019s Tombua Landana Asset is used in demonstrating the tenets of the work-flow. The reservoir under consideration is highly heterogeneous in terms of property distribution and is believed to be highly channelized. The ANN based tool will assist\nin identifying sweet spots by predicting optimal well location/path/completion parameters and production schedule.\nThe multilayer feed forward back propagation based neural network tool developed is able to capture the correlations that exist amongst seismic data, well logs, completion data, and production data. Well logs are correlated using surface seismic attributes and geometric location of wells with an average testing\nerror of less than 15%. The range of testing errors is in between 1-30%. The tool enables the user to predict the entire well log suite for even a horizontal well of user defined configuration through a graphic user interface. Having correlated seismic data with well logs, synthetic well logs are generated for the entire area of seismic coverage. To predict production data, along with seismic data and well logs, schedule of production and interference factors are incorporated as functional links. Upon analyzing the relevancies of input data, functional links based on geographic location and injection wells are included to make the prediction more\nreliable and robust.

Poor recognition accuracy of spontaneous conversational gestures is one of the reasons that restricted their applications for human-computer interaction, biometrics, animated character synthesis and etc. To date, attempts to improve that accuracy have been mostly limited to multimodal frameworks exploiting gesture-word level associations. Such semantically motivated schemas inherited the complexity of natural language and gesture understanding and were found hardly applicable outside of restricted domains.\nThis thesis proposes a new approach that explores prosodic levels of structuring during coverbal gesture production for disambiguation of and gestures. It is based on a multimodal co-analysis of hand kinematics and various prosodic manifestations in speech such as changes of intonation, loudness, and pause duration. Continuous hand movement is represented as a sequence of distinct gesture primitives extracted from the visual signal. Two types of gesticulation are considered: deictic in Weather Channel broadcast and spontaneous beats in presentation monologue videos. For deictic gestures, we define separate computational frameworks to model co-articulation phenomenon and\nproduction constraints. For conversational beats, a set of gesture-speech articulations is defined to represent different functions within a narrative discourse. In this analysis observable perturbations in vocal production are related to the concurrent beat-like\ngestures. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a large multimodal corpus by a significant improvement of gesture recognition accuracy.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5957], "author_name_tesi": "Kettebekov, Sanshzar ", "last_name_ssi": "Kettebekov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sanshzar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara", "Rajeev Sharma", "Ernest Emory Enscore Jr.", "Richard Donovan Koubek", "Rangachar Kasturi", "Mohammed Yeasin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "Rajeev Sharma, Committee Chair", "Ernest Emory Enscore Jr., Committee Member", "Richard Donovan Koubek, Committee Member", "Rangachar Kasturi, Committee Member", "Mohammed Yeasin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gesture recognition", "multimodal", "HCI"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Predictors of Alumni Donor Behavior\nin Graduates of the Traditional MBA and iMBA Programs at The Pennsylvania State University\n", "id": "19330", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9284", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The affordability of a degree from a public university is the subject of much heated debate in the halls of many state governments.

In doing so, this paper extends the model of Sutton (2007), by allowing heterogeneous inputs, and a stark difference between the models is seen for low wage economies. Further, this paper examines the determinants of correlation between usage of high quality inputs and productivity, finding that unlike Kugler (2012), a positive correlation need not exist for a given economy.\n\n\nThe second chapter develops a simple model that explains some patterns in the export behavior of firms.\nFor example, in a standard gravity model, even when controlling for all the usual variables, the rank of GDP of a country is positively and significantly related to inward trade flows, but not outward flows. We also see that firms which expand rapidly into new markets are more likely to survive than firms which expand slowly.\nI assume that the demand for a firm's product is positively correlated across markets, and that the uncertainty is reduced through entry into markets. As a result, the expansion behavior of a firm is driven not only by the expected profits net of entry costs, but also by the information value of an additional observation.\nAllowing for learning can lead to considerably different outcomes for markets that have similar fundamental properties, through both the volume of entry and the types of firms that enter.\nOne consequence of this is that a reduction in trade barriers typically increases entry in some markets, but not others.\n\n\nIn the final chapter, I develop a model that explains how students approach the multiple choice exams for university entrance in Turkey.

Bridge damage in the event of an extreme hazard may cause severe traffic disruption and thus directly affect the functionality of a highway network. The extent of damage that a particular bridge may experience under a certain extreme event condition depends on various factors including severity of the extreme event (e.g., earthquake magnitude), proximity of the bridge with reference to the event location (e.g., the distance from the epicenter of an earthquake), structural health (e.g., chloride induced deterioration, aging), to name a few.  Based on the extent of damage that bridges in a highway network may undergo, efforts are made to restore the original functionality of a network in a fast and economically efficient way. The concept of network resilience is thus closely tied to promptness in restoring the original functionality of a network after an extreme event occurs.  Although the quantification of resilience for highway network greatly depends on the post-event recovery model, network resilience inherently depends on the pre-event structural condition of constituent bridges.  \nThe present study considers a small highway network (with 35 bridges) in the Memphis region. Structural deterioration of constituent bridges due to chlorine diffusion over the bridge life span is studied. The highway network is studied primarily at two different time scenarios, year 2010 and year 2050 for an earthquake of magnitude 6. For each corresponding year, ages of the bridges are identified based on their year of construction and accordingly bridge fragility curves are developed at various stages of bridge life based on past research. Thus developed fragility curves are used in conjunction with recovery patterns to explore time-dependent change of network resilience considering total travel time in the network as the functionality measure. Also, the percentage number of links having different velocity to capacity ratios for each time scenarios is calculated to understand the congestion in different links. It is observed that aging due to chloride deterioration has an adverse impact on seismic resilience of bridge network. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10776], "author_name_tesi": "Kezhiyur, Alben Jose", "last_name_ssi": "Kezhiyur", "middle_name_ssi": "Jose", "first_name_ssi": "Alben", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee Basu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee Basu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Resilience", "Network functionality", "Memphis transportation network", "fragility", "recovery patterns"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Acknowledgments in Scientific Documents: Extraction, Storage, Search, and Social Network", "id": "14492", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acknowledgments are widely used in scientific articles to express gratitude and credit collaborators.

The monetary and efficiency losses could be avoided through a mechanistic understanding of the agglomeration process and prediction of operational conditions that promote agglomeration. Pilot-scale experimentation prior to operation for each specific condition can be cumbersome and expensive. So the development of a mathematical model would aid predictions. The heterogeneity in ash chemical composition, gaseous atmosphere and distributive granular physics properties affect agglomeration. As the particle size distribution changes with agglomeration, the hydrodynamics such as particle collision frequencies also change continuously. This progression makes it challenging to predict the particle growth kinetics, since the chemistry- and physics-based parameters are interdependent. Existing models consider only one of these two aspects. The present work aimed to account for the heterogeneous conditions and develop a modeling methodology that integrates ash chemistry and granular physics.\nWith this motivation, the study comprised of the following model development stages-1) development of an agglomeration modeling methodology based on binary particle collisions, 2) study of heterogeneities in ash chemical composition and gaseous atmosphere, 3) computation of a distribution of particle collision frequencies based on granular physics for a poly-disperse particle size distribution, 4) combining the ash chemistry and granular physics inputs to obtain agglomerate growth probabilities and 5) validation of the modeling methodology. \nThe modeling methodology comprised of testing every binary particle collision in the system for sticking, based on the extent of dissipation of the particles\u2019 kinetic energy through viscous dissipation by slag-liquid (molten ash) covering the particles. In the modeling methodology developed in this study, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are used to estimate the amount of slag-liquid in the system, and the changes in particle collision frequencies are accounted for by continuously tracking the number density of the various particle sizes. The particle number density is also affected by the ash chemistry as solid particles melt to form slag. Computational fluid dynamics modeling is used in conjunction to obtain the initial granular physics inputs to the model. \nIn this study, the heterogeneities in chemical composition of fuel ash were studied by separating the bulk fuel into particle classes that are rich in specific minerals. FactSage simulations were performed on two bituminous coals and an anthracite to understand the effect of particle-level heterogeneities on agglomeration. The mineral matter behavior of these constituent classes was studied. Each particle class undergoes distinct transformations of mineral matter at fluidized bed operating temperatures, as determined by using high temperature X-ray diffraction, thermo-mechanical analysis and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). The heaviest density fraction (>2.6 g/cc) indicated the occurrence of ternary and multi-phase eutectics involving CaO, Fe2O3, SiO2 and Al2O3 phases and a low slag formation onset temperature of 850 \u00b0C. Thus, up to 10 % slag-liquid levels were observed to form around certain particles even at fluidized bed operating temperatures, under oxidizing conditions. Initiation of ash agglomeration occurs around such particles that tend to become sticky, and then propagates in the bed. It was also found that slag-liquid formation began at lower temperatures under the studied reducing environment than under oxidizing conditions and the amount of slag formed was at least 4 times greater for the mineral rich density fractions. Thus, presence of local reducing conditions in the reactor could enhance the propagation of agglomeration.\n\tFor the incorporation of a particle size distribution, bottom ash from an operating plant was divided into four size intervals and the system granular temperatures and dynamic bed height were computed using MFIX, a CFD simulation software. The kinetic theory of granular flow was used to obtain a distribution of binary collision frequencies for the entire particle size distribution. With this distribution of collision frequencies, which is computed based on hydrodynamics and granular physics of the poly-disperse system, as the particles grow, defluidize and decrease in number, the collision frequency also decreases. Under the conditions studied, the growth rate in the latter half of the run decreased to almost 1/5th the initial rate, with this decrease in collision frequency. Additionally, the ash chemistry influenced the melting and the number density of solid particles in the system, which in turn affected the collision frequency.\n\tThis interdependent effect of chemistry and physics-based parameters, at the particle-level, was used to predict the agglomerate growth probabilities of Pittsburgh No. 8, Illinois No. 6 and Skidmore anthracite coals in this study, to illustrate the utility of the modeling methodology. The study also showed that agglomerate growth probability significantly increased above 15 to 20 wt. % slag. It was limited by ash chemistry at levels below this amount. \nAsh agglomerates were generated in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed combustor at Penn State to support the proposed agglomerate growth mechanism. Ash agglomerates were produced by operating the reactor at a superficial gas velocity close to the minimum fluidization velocity of the particles, using rejects from Pittsburgh No. 8 coal, with about 82 % ash content, under oxidizing conditions. Agglomerate samples were also obtained from another fluidized bed combustion facility in Canada. Polished cross-sections of these agglomerates were studied using SEM-EDX to relate the particle-level slag formation and sticking to the chemical composition. FactSage simulations of the slag-forming components were used to estimate the agglomeration temperatures.\nThis study also attempted to gain a mechanistic understanding of agglomerate growth with particle-level initiation occurring at the relatively low operating temperatures of about 950 \u00b0C, found in some fluidized beds. \nThe results of this study indicated that, for the materials examined, agglomerate growth in fluidized bed combustors and gasifiers is initiated at the particle-level by low-melting components rich in iron- and calcium-based minerals. Although the bulk ash chemical composition does not indicate potential for agglomeration, study of particle-level heterogeneities revealed that agglomeration can begin at lower temperatures than the fluidized bed operating temperatures of 850 \u00b0C. After initiation at the particle-level, more slag is observed to form from alumino-silicate components at about 50 to 100 \u00b0C higher temperatures caused by changes in the system, and agglomerate growth propagates in the bed. A post-mortem study of ash agglomerates using SEM-EDX helped to identify stages of agglomerate growth. Additionally, the modeling methodology developed was used to simulate agglomerate growth in a laboratory-scale fluidized bed combustor firing palm shells (biomass), reported in the literature. A comparison of the defluidization time obtained by simulations to the experimental values reported in the case-study was made for the different operating conditions studied. This indicated that although the simulation results were comparable to those reported in the case study, modifications such as inclusion of heat transfer calculations to determine particle temperature resulting from carbon conversion would improve the predictive capabilities.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12382], "author_name_tesi": "Khadilkar, Aditi Bhushan", "last_name_ssi": "Khadilkar", "middle_name_ssi": "Bhushan", "first_name_ssi": "Aditi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Sarma V.

After the city refused to install a plaque commemorating the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery, M\u00e9moire d\u2019Outre-Mer, an association that promotes the memory of overseas French departments in continental France, decided to commission this statue to Liza Marcault-Derouard, a young student at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. The sculpture was inaugurated on April 25, by municipal and regional authorities who did not know of the clandestine status of the project. Eight days later, on May 2nd, after 5,000 people had already praised and applauded the statue during its inauguration, the sculpture was amputated and toppled overnight. The perpetrators were never found. By taking nine local instances of commemoration such as Nantes, the aim of this project is to discover the motif(s) underlying the process of the memorialization of the abolition of slavery through sculpture (statues) and monuments erected since 1998, year of the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in metropolitan France. Within this artistic context of public memory, my thesis unveils the various social, political and aesthetic dynamics at stake in the making of these monuments and exposes the various facets of how a nation, a community or an association narrates its own pasts. I argue that the question of slavery, this not so remote past, and its artistic representations, are intimately tied to current debates about race, identity and immigration in France. In the memory of slavery and its abolition, there is constant violence as individuals and communities debate not only what to remember, but also how, where and why. This dissertation reveals the underlying processes of silencing, burying, selecting, and revising that are at the heart of these monuments. With the 2005 riots and a current political climate highly charged with debates surrounding questions of national identity - \u201cWhat does a national identity mean?\u201d and \u201cWho is French?\u201d - French society is still clearly grappling with the effects of both colonial (including slavery) and postcolonial immigration. My dissertation contributes to the larger and more than ever contentious debate over the question of memory and its place in French national history.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9436], "author_name_tesi": "Khadraoui, Sophia Gaelle", "last_name_ssi": "Khadraoui", "middle_name_ssi": "Gaelle", "first_name_ssi": "Sophia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Boittin", "Jennifer Boittin", "Jonathan Eran Abel", "Vincent Bruyere", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Willa Zahava Silverman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Boittin, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Boittin, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Eran Abel, Committee Member", "Vincent Bruyere, Committee Member", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Memory", "Monuments", "Slavery"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Guided Wave Propagation in Complex Curved Waveguides: Flexural Guided Waves and their Application for Defect Classification in Pipes", "id": "19017", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8071", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-01-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new method, called ray-plate theory, is developed to investigate guided wave propagation in complex curved waveguides. This theory is applied to the study of guided waves in hollow circular cylinders. For the first time analytical relations are derived for longitudinal and torsional dispersion curves in hollow circular cylinders. Dispersion curves, derived using the ray-plate theory, are compared with the results of the Global Matrix Helmholtz decomposition method. It is shown that the predictions of the ray-plate theory are accurate.\\\\\nFlexural modes are investigated in the context of the ray-plate theory. A new consistent understanding is presented for flexural modes in hollow circular cylinders. Several aspects of flexural modes and their relationship with axisymmetric modes are studied. Based on this understanding, helical loading is proposed for pure flexural mode excitation. Analytical relations are derived for the angle of the helical load in order to excite a specific flexural mode. Angular dispersion curves and the concepts of angular dispersivity and angular closeness are introduced for selecting suitable flexural modes for excitation. Finite element analysis and Fourier transforms are utilized to verify the pure excitation of the desired flexural mode at a predicted angle.  It is shown that a pure torsional or longitudinal flexural mode is effectively excited by choosing the correct angle for helical load and applying a suitable load.\\\\\nA beam-steering method is proposed in order to excite flexural modes. A linear phased array is used to steer guided waves in hollow circular cylinders. An analytical relation is derived for time delays to excite a desired flexural mode. Finite element analysis is utilized to examine the pure flexural mode excitation using a linear phased array and the reliability of theoretically predicted time delays. It is shown that the proposed beam-steering method can effectively excite pure flexural modes. Pure flexural mode excitation using helical loading and beam-steering are compared; advantages and disadvantages of each method are considered. \\\\\nExperiments are performed to excite flexural modes experimentally. A ring of transducers with 8 channels are used to experimentally excite pure flexural modes using the beam-steering method in a 4[in] schedule 40 steel pipe. The experiments show that pure flexural modes are excited effectively using the beam steering method.\\\\\nA method based on pure flexural modes is proposed for defect detection and classification in pipes. Pure flexural modes with different angles of propagation are utilized in the inspection process. While for a volumetric defect the reflection coefficient for flexural modes are somewhat similar, for a crack-like defect there is a specific flexural mode that shows the maximum reflection coefficient. This property is used to classify defects as volumetric or crack-like. In addition, the angle of the crack-like defect can be determined using the propagation direction of  this  flexural mode. It is demonstrated that pipeline inspection using flexural modes can be supplemental to the current axisymmetric and focused inspection in order to improve the probability of an accurate inspection process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8015], "author_name_tesi": "Khajeh, Ehsan ", "last_name_ssi": "Khajeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ehsan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Committee Chair", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Guided Waves", "Flexural", "Ultrasonic", "Inspection", "Pipes", "Defect", "Dispersion Curves"]}]
