In comparison to children of immigrants from Europe or Canada, children of immigrants from Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean are less likely to have private insurance compared to government insurance; they are also more likely to be uninsured than have private insurance.\nConclusions:  The lower likelihood of private insurance and the higher likelihood of uninsurance among children of immigrants from Mexico, Latin America, and the Caribbean position these children at risk for poor health outcomes later in life.

Understanding time use may be especially important during the college years when students experience newfound autonomy from parents, explore novel activities, and begin establishing adult behavior patterns.  Although substantial research has documented between-person differences in college students\u2019 time use, little theoretically-based empirical work has followed students longitudinally to explore how their time use changes developmentally across college. Furthermore, little research has explored the adjustment correlates of daily time use in order to understand the circumstances under which college students engage in healthy or harmful behaviors.  Recognizing these gaps in the literature, two empirical studies were conducted exploring the predictors and adjustment implications of time spent on productive activities (academics, employment, and organized activities) among a sample of first through fourth-year college students (n = 736). Students were followed for 14 consecutive days within each of 7 consecutive semesters yielding up to 98 daily diary days per student. Given the nested nature of the data, each study used a multi-level modeling strategy (days nested within semesters nested within individuals).\nThe first chapter tested the time trade-off hypothesis to examine within- and between-person predictors of time spent on academics, employment and organized activities. This hypothesis predicts that spending time in one productive domain reduces time available for other productive domains. Results demonstrated that time spent on productive activities changed as students progressed through college: Academic time was highest at the beginning and near the end of college, whereas organized activities followed an opposite pattern with a peak in the middle semesters. Employment was not common, but increased across college. Time spent on productive activities also differed depending on the day of the week and the season, with academic time being higher on weekdays and in the fall semester and organized activity time being higher on weekends.  In addition, time spent on productive activities varied by demographic characteristics of the student (e.g., gender, parental education, immigrant status, and race). In support of the time trade-off hypothesis, results demonstrated that on days and semesters when students spent more time on employment, they spent less time on academics. However, organized activities and academics were not linked at the semester level, suggesting that a trade-off occured for some, but not all, productive activities. \nThe second empirical chapter focused on the adjustment implications of time spent on academics, employment, and organized activities. Associations of the three productive activities with positive and negative mood, tiredness, and alcohol use were explored at the daily, semester, and between-person levels. On days and semesters when students spent more time on all three productive activities, they reported more tiredness. In addition, at the daily and semester levels, spending more time on academics was associated with more negative affect, more time on employment was associated with less alcohol use, and more time on organized activities was associated with greater positive affect and alcohol use. Results documented complex associations that depended on the level of analysis, and at times, even within-person associations operated in opposing directions. For instance, spending more time on academics was associated with less positive affect at the daily level, but more positive affect at the semester level, suggesting that the daily and semester level indicators of time use may be capturing unique phenomena. \nIn sum, the overarching aim of the current study was to document correlates of time spent on productive activities among college students. Results demonstrated that activities may be in competition for students\u2019 time, highlighting the importance of examining time spent on multiple activities concurrently. In addition, associations between activities and adjustment varied by outcome domain and level of analysis.  These results suggest that between-person studies may be inadequate to capture the complex implications of time use. Instead, attention to multiple time scales and diverse outcome domains is needed in order to best understand how time use may shape adjustment during the college years.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8652], "author_name_tesi": "Greene, Kaylin ", "last_name_ssi": "Greene", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaylin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lianne Maggs", "Kathryn Bancroft Hynes", "Susan Mc Hale", "D Wayne Osgood", "Jeremy Staff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lianne Maggs, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Bancroft Hynes, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["time use", "college students", "alcohol use", "employment", "work", "organized activities", "studying", "positive affect", "negative affect"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Biomechanics of Cart Pushing", "id": "9019s2443", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12073", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gait abnormalities are common in elderly adults and can lead to a loss of mobility.  Tests of function, such as gait speed testing, can help identify these abnormalities.  However, having more sensitive tests of functions could identify abnormalities sooner, allowing issues to be addressed before they become more problematic.  Tasks involving walking while pushing carts or similar devices are a common activity in everyday life.  Examples include shopping carts at supermarkets and department stores, baby strollers, lawn mowers, and wheel barrows.  Some occupations such as postal workers, movers, and warehouse workers are required to push heavy loads frequently throughout the course of their shift.  However, little information is known about how lower extremity biomechanics adapt to pushing carts with different loading conditions.  This knowledge could lead to a better understanding of the functional demands of cart pushing and help increase safety in the workplace.  It could also provide a better understanding of how gait adapts to other challenging tasks and lead to the development of more effective tests of function.\n\nIn this study we compared lower extremity biomechanics in level walking at a speed of 1.2 m/s to pushing a cart under six different loading conditions.  The first three tasks focused solely on the cart.  In the first task, subjects were asked to push an empty shopping cart.  In the second task, a 20 kg weight was added to the cart.  Then in the third task, an additional 20 kg weight was added to the cart for a total mass of 40 kg.  In the next three tasks, a wooden box was mounted to the front of the cart, acting as a sled and increasing the frictional force acting on the cart.  In the fourth task, all of the weight was removed from the cart and a 10 kg weight was placed in the sled.  In the fifth task an additional 10 kg weight was added to the sled for a total of 20 kg in the sled.  In the sixth task, with 20 kg still in the sled, a 40 kg weight was added to the cart.  Nineteen healthy, young adults served as subjects.  Joint angles, moments, powers, and the work done by the ankle, knee, and hip muscles were calculated and compared to the corresponding values computed for the level walking task.  These comparisons allowed us to examine how the ankle, knee, and hip joints adapted to the various tasks and which lower extremity muscle groups contributed the most work as the tasks became more challenging. \n\nIn the three cart tasks, the total amount of work done by the hip, knee, and ankle decreased or remained the same as that found in level walking.  The average peak joint moments and powers were less than in level walking.  This suggests that for the lower extremity, once the cart is moving, pushing a cart with or without weight is actually less difficult than level walking at the same pace.  In the three subsequent sled tasks, the total amount of work done by the hip, knee, and ankle increased compared to level walking.  The peak joint moments and powers were greater than or equal to that of level walking.  The percentage of work done by the knee increased while the percentage of work done by the ankle decreased.  This suggests that for the lower extremities, sled pushing tasks are more difficult than level walking and could be useful as functional tests to detect gait modifications in elderly adults.  Further studies should be done to investigate this possibility.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12134], "author_name_tesi": "Greenert, Katie Patricia", "last_name_ssi": "Greenert", "middle_name_ssi": "Patricia", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cart pushing", "lower extremity biomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development of a Dielectric Buffered Antenna for Close Range Communications in Lossy Media", "id": "26457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10781", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Communications in a lossy medium such as sea water has long been dominated by acoustic and optical methods.

This thesis describes the development of an antenna that is capable of communicating over short distances in sea water by implanting a small dipole antenna into a high permittivity dielectric.  Traditional methods have often tried an antenna encased in an air filled enclosure which has a large impedance mismatch and therefore creates a large reflection at the air-water interface.  An antenna that is encompassed within low loss dielectric that has an impedance similar to sea water will significantly reduce the reflection at the interface.  Additionally. as a byproduct of the surrounding high permittivity dielectric, the antenna size has been significantly reduced.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) are two proven means of intervening on this disease process, with similar patient outcomes. Little is known about the burden of readmission following each of these procedures. We hypothesized that no difference in readmission rates within 30 days or length of stay (LOS) would exist for these two procedures, in spite of baseline differences that might exist between the two patient populations.\nUsing the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) database, we identified 4,319 people who underwent CEA (N=3,640) or CAS (N=679) in Pennsylvania in 2011. Univariate analyses were performed to compare patient characteristics and outcomes, including reasons for readmission, between patients who underwent CEA and those who underwent CAS. Logistic regression was used to estimate the effect of intervention on 30-day readmission, after controlling for potential confounders. Linear regression was used to estimate the effect of intervention on LOS.  Time to readmission was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nPatients who underwent CEA and CAS differed in a few notable ways, including age, race, admission type, and comorbid conditions such as CHF, hemiplegia and paraplegia, and renal disease. The unadjusted rate of 30-day readmission was 9.37% for CEA and 10.75% for CAS (P=0.26). After controlling for patient and procedure characteristics, differences between 30-day readmission rates were still not statistically significant (odds ratio=1.13; P=0.39), although CAS was associated with a statistically significant shorter LOS (-0.30; P<0.0001). Finally, time to readmission was similar for those who underwent CEA and those who underwent CAS (P=0.19). Complications associated with surgery comprised less than 10% of primary readmission diagnoses for both groups.\nReadmission rates following CEA and CAS for carotid artery stenosis are approximately 10%. In spite of differences between patients with carotid stenosis who are selected for endarterectomy and stenting, the choice of procedure does not appear to be associated with different readmission rates or time to readmission, although a marginally shorter LOS after CAS, after controlling for patient characteristics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11759], "author_name_tesi": "Greenleaf, Erin M", "last_name_ssi": "Greenleaf", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak", "Douglas L Leslie", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas L Leslie, Thesis Advisor", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["carotid artery stenosis", "endarterectomy", "stenting"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Children's Mite: Juvenile Philanthropy in America, 1815-1865", "id": "15428", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "7727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My research examines juvenile benevolence in early nineteenth-century America to better explain how the northern middle class \u2013 especially Christian activists among them \u2013 culturally negotiated the developing capitalist economy, and the place of children within it. \u201cChildren\u2019s Mite\u201d considers children\u2019s books, records left by juvenile benevolent societies, parenting guides, and the writing of children themselves. I argue that as reformers who espoused middle-class values, as well as members of the middle class, taught children virtuous ways to use their money, they immersed girls and boys in the world of finance, and thus legitimized juvenile participation in a capitalist economy. Therefore, I contend that the then newly-popularized middle-class ideal of a sheltered, innocent childhood removed from the marketplace, represented, at least in part, an ideological construct. My findings help explain the rise of juvenile consumerism in the nineteenth century, a significant field of study given the importance of conspicuous consumption to current-day childhood, as well as the role of children\u2019s merchandise in the modern-day economy. Furthermore, my dissertation sheds light on the complex relationships among nineteenth-century philanthropy, religion, and a burgeoning consumer economy. \u201cChildren\u2019s Mite\u201d suggests that consumerist and philanthropic impulses are not mutually exclusive. This project also considers how antebellum reform organizations, Sunday schools, and parents trained a rising generation to be entrepreneurs and consumers.  \n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s Mite\u201d argues that antebellum juvenile philanthropic associations, commonly organized out of Sunday schools, acted as spaces where children learned to reproduce their parents\u2019 spending habits: an important indicator of class. In perhaps no arena were anxieties regarding the relationship between children and the economy so explicitly negotiated than reform and benevolent organizations. Reformers mobilized youngsters to participate in these causes as donors, producers of merchandise for fundraising, and members of juvenile societies. In most reform and benevolent causes in antebellum America, reformers recruited children to assume an active and distinct function. However, academics looking closely at the relationship between reform and the economy, including a developing consumer culture, have not extensively considered the role children played.\n\nThis project examines three popular nineteenth-century causes into which girls and boys were recruited: Christian missions, temperance, and aid for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. These endeavors together highlight the diverse ways children were taught to engage in philanthropic campaigns. Indeed, some juvenile reform societies stressed self-sacrifice, while others emphasized a material culture, by which members could identify each other. Moreover, an examination of these three causes offers a valuable perspective by which to see how the relationship between children and philanthropy developed and expanded. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7660], "author_name_tesi": "Greenspoon, David Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Greenspoon", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lori D Ginzberg", "Anthony Edward Kaye", "Gary Scott Cross", "Hester Maureen Blum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lori D Ginzberg, Committee Chair", "Anthony Edward Kaye, Committee Member", "Gary Scott Cross, Committee Member", "Hester Maureen Blum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["antebellum", "benevolence", "charity", "childhood", "children", "Civil War", "consumerism", "missionaries", "Sunday schools", "temperance"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Driver Behavioral Adaptation to the Lateral Drift Warning System\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10188", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "221", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The desired effect of in-vehicle intelligent transportation system (ITS) safety devices is to reduce the likelihood of crash occurrence.  The Roadway Departure Crash Warning (RDCW) alert system, tested by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) in 2004, was installed in test vehicles to determine if drivers changed their behavior over a period of four weeks based on the presence of roadway departure alerts.  This analysis of adaptation while driving behind the wheel of an instrumented vehicle considered the effects of various driver characteristics on adaptation trends, including gender, years of driving experience, personal habits, and predispositions. Assessing changes in alert frequency over time is a direct way to determine if certain forms of adaptation exist while both ignoring and including driver descriptors.  If alert frequency decreases over time, one can say that the system improved safety for drivers.  The major findings showed that the two following statements are true: Smokers decrease alert frequency over time less substantially than do non-smokers; males decrease alert frequency over time more substantially than do females, and their adaptation is more consistent and more significant.  Higher levels of sensation-seeking desires result in less substantial decreases in alert frequency over time, while higher risk perception levels indicate more substantial decreases.  Exposure, an important factor in analyzing event frequency, was shown to significantly positively correlate with alert likelihood.  However, differing levels of driving experience and locus of control do not show clearly-definable adaptation trends.

The kinetic dye test takes about two hours to perform and produces a quantitative result, fitted to a model to yield the intraparticle diffusion constant (IDC).  This is a constant that identifies a carbon\u2019s proficiency to rapidly adsorb compounds. \nThe author identified and analyzed several established test methods used for predicting the sorption of micropollutants and trace organic compounds to GACs. Of these, RSSCTs were deemed to provide the most accurate prediction of full-scale breakthrough. The author predicted that the breakthrough of 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) could be limited by the rate of adsorption, rather than the availability of adsorption sites. As such, the results from the kinetic dye tests have been compared to the results from RSSCTs to confirm the validity of the tests.\nThe author sought to study the influence of pore size distributions, which provide the adsorption sites and kinetics necessary for the removal of those compounds. The author attempted to identify pore volumes that would be critical in enhancing the rate of adsorption of compounds. For coconut carbons, a linear correlation was established between the xylenol orange IDCs and the coconut carbons for pore ranges of 21.65-34.34 \u00c5 (R2 = 0.96) and 25.21-27.24 \u00c5 (R2 = 0.99), and bituminous carbons for pore ranges of 13.70-14.72 \u00c5 (R2 = 0.88) and 73.93-79.85 (R2 = 0.84). Differences in coconut carbons and bituminous carbons have been attributed to the inherently dissimilar graphene layering formed during the activation processes and the starting materials. \nIn developing the kinetic dye tests, three dyes (xylenol orange, fluorescein, and methylene blue) of different structures, sizes, and properties were appraised. These dyes were probed into six coconut-based GACs and six bituminous-based GACs having varied pore distributions. Xylenol orange was ultimately found to be the most suitable dye to work with due to the accuracy of results and the strong fits to the model. Results from the methylene blue testing were not obtained when using the IDC model and this experimental method, as the dye was adsorbed too rapidly to properly identify the adsorption kinetics. Results for fluorescein were found to be less accurate in predicting breakthrough in the RSSCTs than xylenol orange due to larger standard deviations. The author determined that the dye xylenol orange can be used to predict the breakthrough in RSSCTs of MIB in waters with total organic carbons (TOCs) of 1.9 ppm and 2.2 ppm with R2s of 0.77 and 0.85 for coconut carbons and R2s of 0.70 and 0.79 for bituminous carbons.

A significant amount of empirical research has been done in the area of studying the quality of asynchronous online discussions (e.g., Bai, 2012; Mooney, Southard, & Burton, 2014; Wise, Hausknecht, & Zhao, 2014) but there is a lack of in-depth work pertaining to learners\u2019 own experiences with their online course discussions (Rourke & Kanuka, 2007). This literature gap combined with the importance of learners\u2019 experiences (Dewey, 1938; Parrish, Wilson, & Dunlap, 2011) and the growth of online higher education (Allen & Seaman, 2015) grounded this study exploring online graduate students\u2019 experiences with their asynchronous course discussions. The primary data were repeated interviews with eight individual graduate students resulting in over 26 hours of student-interview data that included a stimulated recall where participants demonstrated how they participated in their course discussions. This student-interview data was contextualized with instructor interviews, course analyses, and discussion forum postings. The cases naturally fell along a continuum from learners more positive about their discussion experiences to those notably more negative of the discussions as an activity: from the learner who said \u201cI love the discussion boards\u201d to the learner who said she was \u201cunderwhelmed by this method of interaction.\u201d The data were also considered thematically (Braun & Clarke, 2006) and it was found that even the students more positive about course discussions tended to regard them as a mostly low-quality deliverable, wherein they were \u201cgoing through the motions.\u201d Findings suggest that potential reasons for the low quality experience are a lack of consistent instructor presence; the ways in which assignment requirements shape participation; factors inherent to asynchronous, written communication; and limitations of the discussion forum user interface. In spite of all of this, all but one of the participants would keep the discussions as an activity and described valuing the opportunities the discussions provided for social connections, idea articulation, and collaboration.

The coincidence is the fact that the three greatest writers of the Spanish fin de siglo wrote historical narratives on the same event (the second Carlist war of 1872-1876). Moreover, these novels were written in the short time span between 1897, when Unamuno published his first novel, Paz en la guerra, and 1909, when Valle-Incl\u00e1n finished his trilogy of La guerra carlista and P\u00edo Baroja\u2019s Zalaca\u00edn el aventurero appeared in bookstores. Surprisingly, each delved into a past confrontation which, at first sight, might seem completely alien to the tensions and dynamics of the authors\u2019 own time. The question, obviously enough, is why.\n\tMy dissertation contends that Unamuno, Valle-Incl\u00e1n, and Baroja\u2019s novels on the second Carlist war articulate a critique of their contemporary society through an interpretation of this historical event. This conflict meant for them the problematization of the tensions between tradition and modernity that also plagued them at the turn of the century. In addition, their view on this historical time was mediated by an intense feeling of failure. Unamuno, Valle-Incl\u00e1n, and Baroja revisited Carlism because this movement had a metonymical relationship with the failure of the Liberal revolution of 1868 and, consequently, with the failure of Spanish modernity itself. Furthermore, their take on the historical novel was mediated by the parodic use of the epic, thus reinforcing the notion of failure at a structural level. Through the subversion of the epic, these writers related to a past which was constantly mythified by the official historical and political discourse. \n\tIn sum, this dissertation opens up the field of Edad de plata (1900-1936) through the study of an underanalyzed literary corpus, locating in the historical imagination of the Spanish turn-of-the-century an investigative field to analyze the origins of Spain\u2019s conflicted relationship with modernization, and the inherent tensions that the experience of modernity entailed.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1894], "author_name_tesi": "Gregori Selles, Eduardo ", "last_name_ssi": "Gregori Selles", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eduardo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew J Marr", "Matthew J Marr", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina", "Maria Rosa Truglio", "Gonzalo Rubio"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew J Marr, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew J Marr, Committee Chair", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina, Committee Member", "Maria Rosa Truglio, Committee Member", "Gonzalo Rubio, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Valle-Inclan", "Unamuno", "Failure", "Carlism", "generation of 1898", "modernism", "turn-of-the-century", "Baroja"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DETECTING MP3STEGO EMBEDDED CONTENTS: A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\nON A PARITY STEGANOGRAPHY ALGORITHM", "id": "9586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2929", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Steganographic algorithms are designed to hide the existence of communications, and often do so by embedding hidden contents into innocuous covert media.

The need for wideband systems arise through demand for high data rate communications, multi-frequency radars, and other multipurpose communications devices.  In addition to the circuitry of such systems, the antenna is an important component as well for energy to be effectively radiated over large operating bandwidths.  Many designs and optimizations have focused on creating wideband antennas operating in isolation, but arrays are attractive because of the electronic beam steering capabilities and high gain properties that they exhibit.\n \nThis thesis covers two aspects of wideband antenna array design.  The first topic is the arrangement of antenna elements in an array to maintain low relative sidelobe levels over a wide bandwidth.  The most common configuration, the periodic array, generates grating lobes when the elements are electrically far apart.  Grating lobes are portions of the array factor with power equal to the main beam; they cause energy transmission in undesired directions.  Arranging the elements in an aperiodic fashion often has the benefit of reducing sidelobe levels over extended bandwidths if designed properly.  The method used for aperiodically arranging elements is important to realize arrays with sufficient sidelobe suppression over a useful bandwidth.  The recently introduced polyfractal array design approach is one successful method.  Using the recursive nature of fractals and a powerful optimization technique, arrays exhibiting ultra-wideband performance with very low sidelobe levels have been created.  The focus of the work presented here is to validate the effectiveness of polyfractal arrays consisting of real antenna elements.  To this end, two small polyfractal arrays have been optimized, fabricated, and examined for wideband performance.\n\nThe second topic is the optimization of elements that are arranged in an infinite planar periodic structure.  Arranging elements periodically allows easy of manufacturing and implementation.  Although the upper frequency of operation is limited by the occurrence of grating lobes, large bandwidth percentages can be had if the antenna element is designed properly.  Often, antenna arrays are created by designing a single element and placing it in an array configuration, though this comes with certain consequences.  For instance, the antennas can shift their resonant frequencies and input return loss can become poor because of mutual coupling between elements.  In addition, performance can become severely degraded when arrays are scanned, especially close to grazing angles.  For these reasons, it becomes advantageous to design and optimize the antenna elements while they are in an array.  In this manner, any effects due to nearby elements are automatically accounted for.  Specialized simulation software along with a genetic algorithm is used for this purpose, creating effective wideband radiating elements to be used in planar microstrip phased arrays.  The methods of antenna design and optimization are covered and two examples are presented and validated using a commercial electromagnetics simulation code.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4020], "author_name_tesi": "Gregory, Micah Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "Gregory", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "Micah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Pingjuan Li Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Thesis Advisor", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyfractal", "antenna array", "genetic algorithm", "array factor", "periodic array", "planar array", "infinite array", "microstrip antenna"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "New Methods in Ultra-Wideband Array Design and Finite-Difference Time-Domain Modeling of Memristive Devices", "id": "19084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9232", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation covers two electromagnetics topics, the first is the design of ultra-wideband antenna array layouts.  The second is the design of reconfigurable radio frequency devices with a newly discovered circuit element, the memristor.  The two concepts are seemingly unrelated, however, reconfigurable devices are often used in antennas with multi-band abilities, sometimes switching between frequencies that can be octaves apart.  In order to efficiently use these reconfigurable antennas in phased arrays they must be placed in a proper layout, the focus of the first topic.\n\nThe primary focus of the first topic is the elimination of grating lobes and minimization of peak sidelobe levels in the radiation pattern of antenna arrays.  The occurrence of grating lobes in array factors is very similar to aliasing in a digital system when the sampling frequency is below twice the maximum frequency content (i.e. the Nyquist frequency).  These lobes appear in the array factor or radiation pattern of periodic arrays when the distance between elements becomes greater than one wavelength (for an unsteered array, and less for a steered phased array), resulting in radiation and reception in undesired directions.  Strong mutual coupling negatively affects antenna performance when elements are placed less than a half-wavelength apart, limiting the closest that common antenna elements can be placed.  These two phenomena generally limit the usable frequency bandwidth of conventional periodic array systems to about 2:1.  As many emerging radio frequency systems that utilize multiple frequencies and ultra-wide bandwidths require high directivity, the need for capable array layout designs becomes apparent.  The goal of this portion of research is the creation of design techniques which are capable of readily producing array layouts which yield no grating lobes and low sidelobe levels over vary large frequency bandwidths.\n\nThe second focus involves a new type of electronic device called the memristor.  Their existence was speculated by Leon Chua in the 1970s as the fourth basic circuit element which relates flux to charge.  The result is a passive component with a charge or flux dependent resistance, allowing for design of interesting reconfigurable electromagnetic devices without active circuit elements such as transistors.  It has received significant interest after a research team at Hewlett-Packard labs successfully fabricated a device using titanium dioxide and platinum which exhibits properties that can be modeled by a memristor.  Most excitement resides around their potential for computer memory applications, however, their properties are also useful for other devices.  Many frequency selective surface and antenna structures can have adjustable performance characteristics based on the values of embedded lumped resistor elements.  Replacing the resistors with memristors allows reconfigurability without the use of significant controlling circuitry that is usually necessary with other reconfigurable devices such as active parts (transistors, varactors, etc.) or micro-electrical mechanical switches (MEMS).  A specially tailored finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) simulation code has been developed to analyze and design radio frequency structures with memristive elements.  The code incorporates a memristor model with non-linear dopant drift, an advancement in accuracy versus the conventional linear dopant drift models.  The time-domain nature of FD-TD permits capturing the non-linear and transient behavior of memristors, where quasi-static approximations could only be possible with a frequency domain code.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9045], "author_name_tesi": "Gregory, Micah Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "Gregory", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "Micah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Victor P Pasko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Member", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultra-Wideband Array", "CMA-ES", "Optimization", "Aperiodic Arrays", "Memristor", "Reconfigurable Antennas", "Finite-Difference Time-Domain"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Biomechanics and Control of Torque Production During Prehension", "id": "5991", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The coordinated action of fingers during static tasks involving exertion of force and torque on a hand-held object was studied.  Subjects were asked to keep a handle with an attachment that allowed for independent change of the suspended load (0.5-2.0 kg) and external torque (0.375-1.5 Nm) in a vertical position while applying minimal effort.  Normal and shear forces were measured from the thumb; normal forces only were measured from the four fingers.\n  \nExperimental results:  (1) The thumb shear force increased during supination efforts and decreased during pronation efforts.  (2) The total moment of the normal finger forces counterbalanced only approximately 50% of the external torque.  Hence, shear forces accounted for approximately one-half of the total torque exerted on the object.  (3) The total normal force increased with external torque.  The total force magnitude did not depend on the torque direction.  (4) The forces of the \u2018peripheral\u2019 (index and little) fingers depended mainly on the torque while the forces of the \u2018central\u2019 (middle and ring) fingers depended both on the load and torque.  (5) There was a monotonic relationship between the mechanical advantage of a finger (i.e., its moment arm during torque production) and the force produced by that finger.  (6) Antagonist finger moments acting opposite to the intended direction of the total moment were always observed.  At low external torques, the antagonist moments were as high as 40-60% of the agonist moments.\n\nModeling:  A three-zone model of coordinated finger action is suggested.  In the first zone of load/torque combinations, activation of antagonist fingers, i.e., fingers that generate antagonist moments, is necessary to prevent slipping.  In the second zone, the activity of agonist fingers is sufficient for preventing slips.  In the third zone, the performer has freedom to choose between either activating the antagonist fingers or redistributing the forces amongst the agonist fingers. \n\nOptimization:  Optimization modeling was performed using as criteria the norms of (a) finger forces, (b) relative finger forces normalized with respect to the maximal forces measured in single-finger tasks, (c) relative finger forces normalized with respect to the maximal forces measured in a four-finger task, (d) relative finger forces normalized with respect to the maximal moments measured in single-finger tasks, and (e) relative finger forces normalized with respect to the maximal moments measured in a four-finger task.  All five criteria failed to predict antagonist finger moments when these moments were not imposed by the task mechanics.\n\nReconstruction of neural commands:  The vector of neural commands [c] was reconstructed from the equation [c] = [W]-1[F], where [W] is the finger interconnection weight matrix adjusted from Zatsiorsky et al. (1998) and [F] is the vector of finger forces.  The neural commands ranged from 0 (no voluntary force production) to 1 (maximal voluntary contraction).  For fingers producing moments counteracting the external torque (\u2018agonist\u2019 fingers), the intensity of the neural commands was well correlated with the relative finger forces normalized to the maximal forces in a four-finger task.  When fingers worked to produce moments in the direction of the external torque (\u2018antagonist\u2019 fingers), the relative finger forces were always larger than those expected from the intensity of the corresponding neural commands.  The individual finger forces were decomposed into forces due to \u2018direct\u2019 commands and forces induced by enslaving effects.  Optimization of neural commands resulted in the best correspondence between the actual and predicted finger forces.  The antagonist moments were, at least in part, due to enslaving effects: strong commands to agonist fingers also activated antagonist fingers.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5368], "author_name_tesi": "Gregory, Robert William", "last_name_ssi": "Gregory", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "John Henry Challis", "Mark Latash", "David A.

At the same time, the status of neighborhood attachment (i.e., expressions of local sentiment and satisfaction, behavioral engagement via neighboring and organizational participation) and vitality remains a matter of debate among community scholars. Asians and Hispanics may exhibit less positive attitudes towards their neighborhoods and interact less within them when compared to members of more established groups (namely whites, blacks, and natives), due to differences in key factors such as citizenship status, lingering homeland ties, and neighborhood context. The presence of these growing minority groups can also shape the attachment of other residents as a result of racial prejudice or concerns about local resources, ultimately making neighborhood patterns ripe for change. Nevertheless, few scholars have directed significant attention to the link between increasing racial diversity and neighborhood attachment and vitality. \n   I address this shortcoming in the attachment literature by developing a multiethnic and multilevel framework to examine variation in neighborhood attachment among a sample of 2,411 Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS) respondents. First, I explore the concept of attachment and identify its dimensions. I then assess the strength of attachment among the aforementioned racial groups and explore the factors that influence it. In order to do so I include potential predictors of attachment that have been overlooked in previous research, including individual-level variables that relate to the immigrant experience (i.e., citizenship, length of U.S. residence, and lingering homeland ties), local investments (i.e., length of neighborhood residence, homeownership, and local facility use), and social and demographic statuses, including education and age. Contextual factors, such as local racial composition and socioeconomic status, are also included in the analysis to account for unexplained variation in attachment in the individual-level model.\n   The investigation focuses on four dimensions of attachment: satisfaction, sentiment, neighboring, and formal participation. I demonstrate that Asians and Hispanics deviate from whites and blacks in the strength of their attachment. Attachment is frequently weaker among Asians and Hispanics and, similarly, among immigrants. My individual-level analysis shows that these disparities are moderate and result in part from differences in factors such as education, local danger, and local investment. Using hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), I show that neighborhood characteristics, namely racial and ethnic composition, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and residential stability, help account for some --  though not all -- of the remaining intergroup attachment differences. The analysis also reveals that the presence of blacks and Hispanics erodes the attachment of some residents, regardless of individual race. Since the expectation to move is a key component in the process of residential change and neighborhood instability, I give attention to the role of attachment in shaping moving expectations. I find that weaker attitudinal attachment contributes to these expectations. \n   Overall, my results suggest that the growth of racial and ethnic diversity does not pose an immediate threat to neighborhood attachment or vitality. Due to some recent increases in intergroup inequality and racial aversion, however, changes in the neighborhood experience could be on the horizon.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4142], "author_name_tesi": "Greif, Meredith Jill", "last_name_ssi": "Greif", "middle_name_ssi": "Jill", "first_name_ssi": "Meredith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Eric Silver", "Mark Hill", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Chair", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "Mark Hill, Committee Member", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neighborhood attachment", "racial and ethnic diversity", "assimilation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Predicting the consequences of diverse life history in malaria parasites: synchrony and transmission investment", "id": "22446", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10267", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Malaria parasites have evolved astonishingly varied means of solving the same basic problem of converting host resources---red blood cells---into parasite biomass that can be transmitted to vectors and ultimately, new hosts. This diversity is challenging to explain, because if a life history trait improved transmission, parasites with that trait would be expected to displace others. How can such divergent strategies all lead to sustained transmission success? I focus on two aspects of the malaria life cycle, synchronization of blood stage infection and allocation to transmission, to examine how within-host ecology can maintain diverse parasite strategies. The models I develop to address that question are also used to identify robust methods for inferring parasite traits from time series data.\n\nThe models show that the advantages of synchrony depend on the interplay between competition for host resources, immune clearance, and the odds of transmitting to a vector, all of which vary with parasite densities. Using data from lab-cultured parasites, I examine the intra-strain competitive interactions in more detail, finding preliminary support for a form of density-dependent competition that, counterintuitively, may benefit synchronous parasites. The model demonstrates that traditional inference methods can give misleading estimates of parasites' life cycle length. Within the host, the model suggests that competition between coinfecting strains should reduce allocation to transmission stage production. Allowing transmission investment to vary through time, the model indicates that transmission investment is especially costly early in infection. Inspired by the controversy in the literature concerning how best to infer transmission investment, I use the model to show that current methods are likely incapable of ruling out the null hypothesis that transmission investment is fixed through time rather than plastic, and develop improved methods for inferring transmission investment.

This Diels-Alder reaction not only established the C(5)-C(10) relative stereochemistry of lepadiformine, but was also strategically functionalized for elaboration to the tricyclic ring system.

A complex of the cytoplasmic membrane proteins ExbB, ExbD, and TonB transduces energy derived from the cytoplasmic membrane protonmotive force (PMF) to permit ligand release into the periplasm, with TonB physically contacting the outer membrane transporter.  Although no individual sidechain in the E. coli TonB is irreplaceable, TonB consists of two essential domains: a transmembrane domain (TMD) that interacts with ExbB and ExbD and a periplasmic carboxy-terminal domain that interacts with outer membrane transporters.\n\nThe mechanisms by which TonB facilitates ligand transport across the outer membrane have been a matter of considerable debate.  In one model, the TonB TMD delivers energy to transporters by \u201cshuttling\u201d between cytoplasmic and outer membranes, a process that would require the TMD to be removed from the cytoplasmic membrane.  Alternatively, several mechanical models suggest that TonB always remains anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane during energy transduction.  The ideal test of the shuttle model is to fuse a stable protein domain to the amino terminus of TonB to prevent it from shuttling and determine if the fusion retains activity.  In this study, a ToxR-TonB fusion was proteolytically stable, retained the ability to form PMF-independent and PMF-dependent interactions with ExbD and exhibited wild-type ferrichrome transport rates.  Therefore, TonB does not shuttle in vivo.  \n\nThe observation that the TonB TMD did not shuttle suggested that its primary role was to mediate assembly of TonB with ExbB, ExbD, or another TonB.  TonB was previously known to dimerize in vivo, yet the contributions of TMD sidechains (e.g. H20) to dimerization were relatively unexplored.  Here, an inactive TonB H20A substitution categorically reduced dimerization through the TonB carboxy terminus.  TonB H20A also prevents association between TonB and ExbD.  Since ExbD forms homodimers before associating with TonB, the results are consistent with the idea that TonB forms homodimers before forming TonB-ExbD heterodimers.  Disulfide-linked TonB dimers formed through TonB F125C, located in a disordered region of the periplasmic domain, could fractionate with the outer membrane whereas dimers formed within TonB carboxy-terminal residues 186-230 were unable to associate with the outer membrane.  This suggests that dimers formed through TonB residues 186-230 need to be resolved for this region to associate with the outer membrane, which is consistent with the suggestion that the dimers form early in an energy transduction cycle.\n\nFinally, this work identified sites of functionally significant interaction between TonB and the FepA cork domain using in vivo photocrosslinking with the photoreactive amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa).  Each of the pBpa substitutions that could crosslink to TonB are located in regions of FepA that are exposed to the periplasm in the FepA crystal structure, suggesting that TonB does not contact other areas of the cork in vivo.  The presence of enterochelin strengthened crosslinking through some positions but diminished crosslinking through FepA I14pBpa, V28pBpa and T32pBpa.  This suggests that TonB binds more efficiently to these three sidechains in the absence of ligand, and once ligand binds, the transporter undergoes a conformational rearrangement to bind different sites.  Deletion of the TonB box did not reduce crosslinking through FepA T32pBpa or I145pBpa, suggesting that formation of these complexes does not require a functional transporter.\n\nOverall, this work extended knowledge of how the TonB TMD and carboxy-terminal domain participate in early and late stages of energy transduction and provided more insight into TonB-transporter interactions beyond the characterized TonB-TonB box interaction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9758], "author_name_tesi": "Gresock, Michael George", "last_name_ssi": "Gresock", "middle_name_ssi": "George", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle", "Kathleen Postle", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "B Tracy Nixon", "Lorraine C Santy", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Chair", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TonB", "FepA", "signal transduction", "iron transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "SHIFTING THE LINES: THE 'FREINET' TEACHERS, 'CITOYENS' AND 'PEDAGOGUES' 'REPUBLICAINS' ", "id": "7199", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2216", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\u201cD\u00e9placer les lignes\u201d: les enseignants Freinet, citoyens et p\u00e9dagogues r\u00e9publicains\n\n[\u201cShifting the lines\u201d: The Freinet teachers, citoyens and p\u00e9dagogues r\u00e9publicains]\n\n\u00ab Si l\u2019on nous demande, \u2018quelle est la ligne de votre mouvement?\u2019, nous devrions sans doute r\u00e9pondre, \u2018le mouvement qui d\u00e9place les lignes\u2019. \u00bb \n\n[If we\u2019re asked, \u2018 what is your movement\u2019s line ?\u2019, we should probably answer, \u2018the movement that shifts the lines\u2019.]\n\n\tIn the fields of cultural and intellectual history and cultural studies  today, questions of education open interesting perspectives for the understanding of contemporary France.

Land clearing and the construction of milldams caused the deposition of several meters of fine-grained sediment above the pre-existing soils. Subsequent dam breaching converted broad wetlands to incised streams. Previous work shows that pre-settlement soils contain seeds from herbaceous wetland species, but these studies do not include leaf macrofossil evidence and provide little evidence of woody species. This study uses subfossil leaves to reconstruct the pre-European settlement flora of White Clay Creek, Chester County, PA and describes the influence of European settlement on the floral community at the site. Leaf subfossils were collected from a stream cut of the eastern branch of White Clay Creek, processed, and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Leaf fragments spanning the subfossil layer were radiocarbon dated to accurately constrain the timing of deposition. Unlike a seed flora from a similar site, leaves found at the study site are generally from woody species and have a diverse range of wetland affiliations. Species found include obligate and facultative wetland species, specifically three morphotypes of willow (Salix sp.), swamp maple (Acer rubrum) and hazel alder (Alnus serrulata) and one facultative species, American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Leaves of species within the white and red oak subgenera  (Quercus subgenus Quercus and Quercus subgenus Lobatae) were also found, but could not be identified to the species level. The large differences between the leaf flora and seed flora at a similar site show that the two plant organ types provide data about different portions of the community and indicate that future Holocene reconstructions should include both seeds and leaves. The diversity in wetland indicator statuses shows that leaf subfossils originate both from the riparian buffer and surrounding hill slopes. This flora, deposited between 217 and 368 bp, immediately preceding European settlement, contains more wetland species than the modern vegetation, suggesting that European settlement, specifically the construction of milldams altered floral composition. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1042], "author_name_tesi": "Grettenberger, Christen Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Grettenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Christen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf", "Peter Daniel Wilf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fossil leaves", "Holocene", "subfossil flora", "paleontology"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Microbial Communities In Acid Mine Drainage Ecosystems", "id": "27394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11950", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial communities are important ecosystem engineers and they profoundly affect local and global biogeochemical cycling. For this reason, they can play important roles in bioremediation \u2013 we can harness their metabolic power to efficiently and inexpensively remediate environmental problems like acid mine drainage (AMD). Acid mine drainage is an industry-related pollution problem affecting watersheds globally. Current remediation strategies are often costly and ineffective. However, there has been recent interest in using bioremediation to treat AMD. This idea is based on the premise that naturally occurring iron(II)-oxidizing species can remove iron and other metals from AMD. To do so, it is necessary to understand microbial ecology in these ecosystems. This research aimed to discover the microbial factors that control the rate of iron-oxidation at a number of AMD sites and identify the ways in which these microbes alter biogeochemical cycling and may serve as valuable model systems in microbial ecology and bioremediation. Specifically, I aimed to (1) to identify the microbial species responsible for high iron-oxidation rates at Scalp Level Run, an AMD site where iron is removed five to seven times faster than other sites in PA and the Iberian Pyrite Belt, (2) to determine how microbial community composition and metabolic potential in subsurface microbial communities is influenced by subsurface geochemical gradients, and (3) to determine if geography may play a role in structuring microbial populations in AMD ecosystems.\nThe microbial communities at Scalp Level contain a taxon closely related to Ferritrophicum radicicola, which is not found at other AMD sites. The presence of this taxa distinguishes Scalp Level from other sites, but the role it plays in biogeochemical cycling is unknown. At Brubaker Run,  I found that, although community composition is different in surface than in subsurface microbial communities, their metabolic potential is not significantly different in the surface than the subsurface. Lastly, microbial communities in AMD may  adhere to the distance-decay relationship. There is dispersal limitation between distant sites. This may indicate that for bioremediation to be successful, microbes may need to be transplanted from one site to another. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11392], "author_name_tesi": "Grettenberger, Christen Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Grettenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Christen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady", "Erica A H Smithwick", "William D Burgos", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady, Dissertation Advisor", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Chair", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbial ecology", "ecology", "acid mine drainage", "AMD", "metagenomics", "next-generation sequencing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The influence of increased crop genotypic diversity on arthropods in agroecosystems ", "id": "26533", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11766", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Higher levels of plant diversity within fields, farms, and landscapes helps counteract the vulnerability of crop fields to insect pests by promoting both plant-mediated (bottom-up) and natural enemy-mediated (top-down) control of insect herbivores. Cultivar mixtures increase crop genotypic diversity and present a tactic to diversify agricultural systems that is more feasible than increasing plant species diversity in fields. Encouragingly, mixtures of plant genotypes can influence arthropod communities and increase plant productivity in both natural and agricultural systems. \n\nI examined the potential use of cultivar mixtures to suppress insect pests in field crops using a combination of field, greenhouse, and laboratory experiments with two model systems: soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) and soybean, and bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) and wheat. I also characterized the natural enemy community available to suppress soybean aphids in PA as well as ants that may serve as mutualists of the aphids. I further tested determined if the arthropod community sampled in the foliage at night was distinct from the community captured during the day. Soybean fields in central Pennsylvania hosted a diverse arthropod community that contained many taxa identified in previous surveys across the U.S., but also a number that were previously missed, omitted, or identified at a coarser level. The community of natural enemies collected at night was distinct from the day-collected community. Specifically, a number of predators and ant taxa were more abundant in the foliage at night and have been under-represented in previous work. Under low pest pressure, soybean cultivar mixtures did not host smaller aphid populations than monocultures, but did produce intermediate aphid populations and influenced natural enemies and predation. Similarly, genotypic diversity per se did not reduce R. padi populations in the greenhouse on spring wheat. Populations on individual mixtures rarely differed from those on the individual components of the mixtures grown in monocultures. However, aphid populations on mixtures were intermediate in mixtures compared to the monocultures, and on individual plants of certain varieties, genotypic diversity influenced aphid populations. Interactions between plants or source-sink population dynamics likely increased or decreased aphid populations on some varieties in mixtures compared to monocultures. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata De Geer), an aphid predator, was influenced by plant genotypic diversity. It was more abundant on or attracted to aphid-infested plants in mixtures than in monocultures. In winter wheat, plant-plant interactions in diverse neighborhoods reduced aphid offspring production across tested varieties. However, the specific effect of neighborhood diversity depended upon variety identity. In addition, the influence of neighborhood diversity was most pronounced when plants were adequately watered and not drought-stressed. \nMy results indicate that while genotypic diversity per se does not always suppress pests and reduce pest populations, cultivar mixtures can significantly affect both herbivores and their natural enemies and the \u201ccorrect\u201d mixtures could play a role in suppressing pests. Both bottom-up and top-down forces can mediate effects of crop genotypic diversity on herbivores. Simple mixtures are now widely used for managing pest resistance to transgenic Bt corn, providing an opportunity to consider moving beyond these simple mixtures and genotypic monocultures in other crops.\n\nMy findings indicate that producing effective mixtures will require careful development and will likely benefit from cooperation between entomologists and plant breeders to produce mixtures that are acceptable to growers and contain relevant diversity to suppress pests.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11232], "author_name_tesi": "Grettenberger, Ian Mahaffy", "last_name_ssi": "Grettenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "Mahaffy", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Frazier Tooker", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Matthew Brian Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Frazier Tooker, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Matthew Brian Thomas, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["variety mixture", "diversity", "aphid", "pest management", "genotypic diversity"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Changes in calcareous nannoplankton assemblages during the recovery of the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)", "id": "14167jvg5663", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14167", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Warming and associated environmental perturbations during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 55.8 Mya) caused permanent changes in calcareous nannoplankton communities. Assemblages during the onset of the PETM have been studied in extraordinary detail with temperature proposed as the main control on community structure; however, few analyses have focused on the recovery stage. Thus, we lack a clear understanding of how communities responded to gradual cooling and recovery of habitats following a rapid warming event. Here, we have performed high-resolution assemblage studies of coastal sites \u2013 (Wilson Lake and CamDor cores) \u2013and open ocean sites from a variety of latitudes (Ocean Drilling Program Sites 738, 1210, and 1263). Multivariate statistics are applied to the global data set to assess how assemblage structure changed in these different settings. Results show that assemblages and the environmental controls on assemblage structure are highly variable across oceanic settings. For example, eutrophic genera show different trends at Wilson Lake in New Jersey and CamDor in Maryland even though these sites are a few hundred miles apart. Similarly, across a variety of latitudes in the open ocean, thermophilic taxa show a variable decline in abundance. We find that nannoplankton assemblages in the onset of the event were controlled predominantly by temperature change, whereas in the recovery, a combination of temperature and nutrients drove changes, thus explaining the highly variable pattern.

Understanding their precise structure-function relationships will provide insights that can lead to chemical and structural design rules for the next generation of organic solar cell materials. In this work, two major classes of materials were investigated: Singlet fission sensitizers and semiconducting block-copolymers. By exploiting chemical design and film processing techniques, a variety of controllable nanoscale structures could be developed and related to their subsequent photophysical properties, including triplet and charge transport. Time-resolved optical spectroscopies, including both absorption and emission techniques, were used to measure the population dynamics of excited states and charge carriers following photoexcitation of the semiconducting materials.\n     Singlet fission, an exciton multiplication reaction that promises to boost solar cell efficiency by overcoming thermalization loss, has been characterized in several organic molecules. If the energetics are such that the excited state singlet energy is at least twice the triplet energy, then a singlet exciton may split into two triplet excitons through an intermolecular energy-sharing process. The thin film structure of a model singlet fission compound was exploited by modulating its crystallinity and controlling polymorphism. A combination of visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared transient absorption spectroscopies were used to investigate the precise singlet fission reaction mechanism. It was determined that the reaction intermediates consist of bound triplet pairs that must physically separate in order to complete the reaction, which results in multiplied, independent triplet excitations. Triplet transfer, which is modulated by molecular packing arrangements that control orbital overlap coupling, was found to determine the efficacy of triplet pair separation. Furthermore, the formation of these independent triplets was found to occur on longer (picosecond) timescales than previously believed, indicating that any kinetically competing relaxation processes, such as internal conversion, need to be controlled. Last, it was found that the diffusion of the multiplied triplet excitons, and thus their harvestability in devices, is highly influenced by the crystallinity of the material. In particular, the presence of even a small amount of \u201ccontaminant\u201d amorphous phase was determined to be detrimental to the ultimate triplet diffusion length. Future research directions are outlined, which will be used to develop further chemical and structural design rules for the next generation of singlet fission chromophores.\n     Semiconducting block-copolymers, because of their natural tendency to self-assemble into ordered nanoscale structures, offer an appealing strategy for controlling phase segregation between the hole and electron transport materials in organic solar cells. Such phase segregation is important for both ensuring efficient conversion of the photogenerated excitons into charge carriers, and for creating percolation pathways for efficient transport of the charges to the device electrodes. Time-resolved mid-infrared spectroscopy was developed for monitoring charge recombination kinetics in a series of block-copolymer and polymer blend films possessing distinct, controlled nanoscale morphologies. In addition to explaining previous work that correlated film structure to device efficiency, it was revealed how the covalent linkage in block-copolymers can be carefully designed to prevent rapid recombination losses. Furthermore, novel solution-phase systems of block-copolymer aggregates and nanoparticles were developed for future fundamental spectroscopic work. Future studies promise to explain precisely how polymer chain organization, including intrachain and interchain interactions, governs their ultimate charge photogeneration and transport properties in solar cells.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15908], "author_name_tesi": "Grieco, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Grieco", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John B Asbury", "John B Asbury", "Lasse Jensen", "Mark Maroncelli", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John B Asbury, Dissertation Advisor", "John B Asbury, Committee Chair", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["organic semiconductors", "time-resolved spectroscopy", "optical spectroscopy", "photophysics", "singlet fission", "block-copolymers", "inorganic phosphors", "triplet dynamics", "polaron recombination", "organic solar cells", "organic solar cell materials", "x-ray diffraction", "triplet-triplet annihilation", "ultrafast mid-infrared spectroscopy", "time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy", "correlated triplet pair", "pentacene derivatives", "transient absorption spectroscopy", "crystalline films"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "DIETARY FATS: \nA QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO REDUCING RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE FASTING AND FED STATE\n", "id": "7104", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "92", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two research studies were conducted in normo- and hypertriglyceridemic individuals to determine the quantitative and qualitative effects of dietary fatty acids in the fasting and fed states, respectively.  A randomized controlled feeding study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the chronic consumption of a low-fat versus a moderate-fat diet.  The results of the studies conducted demonstrate that chronic intake of dietary patterns at either end of the recommended range of total dietary fat intake (20-35% total kcal) improves levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins.  Despite a reduction in fasting triglycerides following the low-fat diet, hypertriglyceridemic individuals had higher levels of atherogenic apolipoproteins following the low-fat diet, compared to the moderate-fat diet.  Based on this study, the recommendation to consume a more moderate fat diet must also include a focus on the quality of the fat being consumed.  The results of the second study, a randomized crossover design postprandial study indicate that the consumption of different kinds of fatty acids have very different affects on postprandial risk factors for CVD.  In particular, the simple heating of a PUFA increased levels of individual trans fatty acid isomers and lipid hydroperoxides, resulting in diverse physiological responses, compared to the same un-heated PUFA.  In summary, whereas the implementation of a very healthy low-fat diet may have adverse affects on the apolipoprotein profile of individuals with elevated baseline triglyceride levels, the inclusion of unsaturated fatty acids in a moderate-fat diet, has a significant hypotriglyceridemic effect in individuals, regardless of baseline triglyceride status.  In making the recommendation to consume a moderate-fat diet it is important to recognize the effects of individual fatty acids on postprandial risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  In particular, the heating of highly unsaturated fatty acids leads to the production of trans fatty acids and lipid oxidation end products.  The diverse physiological responses observed thus indicate that a diet rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids is optimal, when compared to a diet rich in saturated and/or trans fatty acids.

In an effort to ensure that early childhood programs are of high quality, many states are implementing systems that identify levels of criteria that denote excellence. Pennsylvania has adopted such a system, and one quality indicator relates to the educational qualifications of teachers in childcare settings. As a result, many Pennsylvania early childhood practitioners are enrolling in formal education programs. Although ongoing professional development and nontraditional students are not new phenomena, the circumstances surrounding early childhood teachers\u2019 return to formal education are unique. This dissertation addresses the need for a qualitative inquiry of early childhood teachers\u2019 experiences returning to school and how they make meaning of those experiences. Drawing on narrative inquiry, the study details the experiences of four early childhood practitioners who have recently completed or are currently pursuing further education in response to a state quality rating improvement initiative. Through semi-structured interviews, participants describe their life history, their experiences related to going back to school, and their efforts to piece together their personal, professional, and academic lives. Participant interviews were crafted into profiles that capture the uniqueness of each participant\u2019s experience as well as highlight similar experiences among participants. Multiple analyses of the profiles yielded four themes evident in each participant\u2019s discourse. Themes included TEACH funding, Exiting the field, Teacher education and quality teaching, and Appropriate coursework. An additional theme, Program difficulty, was limited to one participant\u2019s experience but was significant enough to warrant inclusion in the write-up. Study results illustrate the perceived benefit of credentials as useful and relevant for early childhood teachers and administrators. Findings also indicate that participants find higher education coursework as less relevant to their roles and duties. Noteworthy are participants\u2019 beliefs regarding the usefulness and relevancy of their courses. In the study, terms are not used interchangeably. However, the dialogue brings to light participants\u2019 tension between the content of coursework and the degree to which learners perceive it is applicable to their professional roles and responsibilities.  Overall, formal education and training programs are found to be valuable for maintaining early childhood education\u2019s status as a profession and for increasing the quality of young children\u2019s everyday experiences.

A newly developed approach targets the monitoring of methane from gaining streams during base flow to estimate methane concentrations and fluxes from groundwater. We implemented this technique on three streams in northeastern Pennsylvania. Measured concentrations of dissolved methane in stream waters ranged between 1\u201328 \u00b5g/L, and in samples from piezometers inserted into stream beds reached as high as 4600 \u00b5g/L. \u03b413C CH4, \u03b413C C2H6, and \u03b42H CH4 were measured and used to characterize the source of methane as thermogenic or biogenic gas. The isotopic signatures of waters varied along stream reaches and varied seasonally. In contrast, the groundwater compositions inferred from piezometer waters were consistent. This consistency of the deeper waters supports the interpretation that piezometers sampled groundwater with thermogenic gas whose isotopic signature remained constant through the two seasons studied. A mass balance equation was used to estimate the influxes of methane from groundwater in gaining subreaches along three of the streams along with methane losses to the atmosphere. A numerical model was also used to simulate methane influx and degassing along three stream reaches. For streams in Susquehanna County, the fluxes to the atmosphere from an area equivalent to the stream footprint ranged from 1.9 to 11.6 mg m-2 d-1. In Sugar Run, methane was lost to the atmosphere at fluxes between 72 to 422 mg m-2 d-1, within the range of methane fluxes measured by aerial measurements in regions of intense drilling in Pennsylvania. In Susquehanna County, lineament analysis is consistent with the conclusion that methane may be migrating upward along faults or joints, but no such feature was identified near Sugar Run in Lycoming County. The gas isotopes are consistent with this in that the isotopic signatures collected in Susquehanna County are like those of gas deriving from the Catskill Formation. In Sugar Run, however, the gas data could be consistent with gases derived from the Marcellus Formation which lies at 4000 m depth. Given that no pre-development data are available, however, the measurements cannot be used to distinguish gas flows driven strictly by natural pressure gradients versus contributions related to shale gas wells. This work shows that the stream reach approach can provide watershed-scale estimates of groundwater composition and influx and, if completed before and after drilling, could provide a relatively cheap, aerially-extensive, and easily implemented technique to document contamination from shale gas development.

The ability to meet normative developmental milestones despite experiencing homelessness may rest in their capacity to form and maintain supportive interpersonal relationships. Maintaining supportive interpersonal relationships that can provide social support may be contingent upon how youth navigate their surroundings during day-to-day interactions. Social support is a dynamic process, necessitating research designs that capture experiences on a fast time scale (e.g., moment-to-moment or day-to-day). Unfortunately, most homelessness research relies on correlational and cross-sectional designs that examine stable characteristics or behaviors, rather than dynamic interpersonal processes.\nThis dissertation provides a comprehensive review of the literature that focuses on the effects of homelessness on academic achievement and mental health outcomes. The review identifies the scope of the effect of homeless, risk and protective indicators, and methodological limitations of designs commonly used to examine homelessness. Although each design provides useful insight into the impact of homelessness, the review explains how combining baseline surveys and longitudinal designs with innovative experience sampling approaches (e.g., EMA and daily diary designs) can advance homelessness research. Combining these designs can improve researchers\u2019 ability to investigate both how homelessness affects the lives of youth and how many youth overcome the challenges associated with homelessness. \nThis dissertation presents the first studies to use an experience sampling approach to capture a detailed depiction of the in-school and after school experiences of doubled-up homeless youth (i.e., sharing housing or \u2018couch-surfing\u2019). These studies utilize a 10-day twice-a day diary design to examine the process of resilience in a sample of doubled-up homeless youth. Study 1 examines the impact of teacher and peer support on later day positive and negative affect. For later day negative affect, baseline peer support operated as a protective factor. Later day positive affect was predicted by early day peer support and baseline teacher support. Furthermore, the association between early day peer support and later day positive affect was moderated by baseline peer social support, such that youth with high baseline peer support were protected against low early day peer support. Study 2 focuses on the combined impact of risk and protective aspects of peer relationships on later day homework completion, as well as the intersectionality between homelessness and identifying as LGBT. Results suggest that youth who identified as LGBT experience more peer victimization but also spend more time completing homework. The association between identifying as LGBT and homework completion underscores that different pathways to homelessness (i.e., being pushed out by parents due to sexual orientation) can correspond to distinctive amounts of academic risks. In addition, peer victimization moderated the association between early day peer support and later day homework completion. The protective impact of early day peer support on later day homework completion appears to be reduced by high levels of baseline peer victimization. Together, these studies build on prior research by proposing the use of experience sampling approaches to investigate risk and protective characteristics relevant to the lives of homeless youth and by using a twice-a-day diary design to investigate the within-person processes in which social support impacts homeless youth.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16342], "author_name_tesi": "Griffin, Amanda Mary", "last_name_ssi": "Griffin", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Hobart H.

J. Ramadge and\nW. M.  Wonham in the late 80's as a method of understanding control of\na wide variety of discrete event dynamic systems.  A discrete event\ndynamic system (DEDS) is characterized by a directed, labeled\ngraph. The nodes of this system are called the states, the arcs of the\nsystem are called transitions. Each transition has an event label. In this \nsense, an event causes the DEDS to change from one state to another. There\nis a special state called the starting state and a set of special\nstates called the terminal, marked or final states. A system modeled\nby a state machine is assumed to exist in one of the states and\ntransition from state to state as a result of the generation or\nexecution of events. The alphabet of events is partitioned into\ncontrollable and uncontrollable events. Controllable events may be\ndisabled by a system supervisor. Given a system to control\n(called the plant) modeled by a DEDS, a supervisor will disable\ncertain events from occurring in the system in order to achieve a\ncertain desired behavior. The supervisor is often designed as a second\nDEDS whose transitions correspond to enabled events. When\nthe two DEDS are run in parallel, the supervisor may exert enabling\nand disabling control over the plant.\n\nSCT is well understood in the case when both the plant and the\nsupervisor are modeled as finite state machines; i.e., the number of\nDEDS states in both the plant and supervisor are finite. Several\nauthors have remarked that the theory of SCT need not be restricted to\nthe finite state case and in many ways they are correct. However, with\nthe notable exception of a few Petri Net models, almost all of the\nresults on SCT have been restricted to finite state\nsystems. Specifically, decision algorithms for controllability and\noptimality are all restricted to the finite state case because in the\ninfinite state case they become poorly defined.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is three-fold: First, we develop an\nextended SCT that enables the modeling of infinite state systems by\nadding pushdown stack memory to the finite state machine models of the\nDEDS supervisors.  Second we show that there are strong computability\nbounds on the nature of our new extended models with respect to the\nprimary controllability criterion for discrete event control. That is,\ncertain classes of control specifications cannot be provably\nenforced. Third, we provide a new theory of parametric optimal control\nin DEDS systems that extends to cases when the controller is a\npushdown machine.  We explore the problem of synthesizing a controller\nthat will act optimally for all time. We derive a novel branch and bound\nalgorithm for synthesizing such an optimal controller. \n\nThree applications of the theoretical framework developed in this\nthesis are provided. The first shows how pushdown machines are capable\nof modeling subsets of the 802.11 wireless network protocol and\ndisplays methods for analyzing such protocols for robustness to\nattacks. The second application demonstrates how to use discrete event\ncontrol to model computer security policies and shows how the pushdown\nstack memory of a deterministic pushdown machine can be used to\nenumerate file access information. The third example shows how the\npushdown stack model can generalize the NASA Livingstone modeling\nsystem for use in validating robotic control systems for missions in\ndeep space. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1222, 1223], "author_name_tesi": "Griffin, Christopher Howard", "last_name_ssi": "Griffin", "middle_name_ssi": "Howard", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tom Michael Cavalier", "Terry Lee Friesz", "Jose Ventura", "George Kesidis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tom Michael Cavalier, Committee Chair", "Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Member", "Jose Ventura, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decidability", "Control", "Discrete Event System", "Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Carrying Capacity of Ancient Maya Swidden Maize Cultivation: A Case Study in the Region around San Bartolo, Peten, Guatemala\n", "id": "15390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the carrying capacity of the landscape of the Ixc\u00e1n Rio Basin in northeastern Guatemala.  Sustaining areas around the sites of San Bartolo, La Prueba, and Xultun are studied using image analysis of satellite data as well as well as field survey of vegetation patterns.  These Maya sites, which span in occupation from the Middle Preclassic to the Late Classic, have been investigated to various degrees by the archaeological Proyecto San Bartolo (PROSABA) since 2001.\nRemote sensing using false-color composites of IKONOS and Landsat data has proven a valuable tool for identifying the locations of buried Maya settlements under the dense tropical canopy of this part of the Pet\u00e9n.  In this dissertation I propose further refinement of this method to better distinguish vegetation communities.  The results of satellite image analysis are supported by field survey of forest inventory and soil analysis.  Combined, these methods of microenvironment delineation give a good approximation of agricultural valuation of land types.  The value of this indirect application of remote sensing to archaeological research is demonstrated through an evaluation of carrying capacity for the study sites as well as more broadly for the study region.\nTo calculate ancient carrying capacities for the study areas examined here, I propose that maize was the staple food, constituting between 60-80% of caloric intake, and further that this maize was predominantly produced using swidden agriculture with yield variability according to the length of the fallow period, the land type, and prior landscape history.  I review ethnographic documentation of contemporary maize yields and consumption patterns to develop better estimates of Precolumbian maize productivity.  This research is intended to provide maximum reasonable estimates of carrying capacity, so for the purposes of the analyses described in this dissertation I limit the number of factors which can, and certainly did, result in populations lower than what might be considered maximal populations.  The results presented here help to give a reasonable upper limit for carrying capacities for swidden maize farming in the study region.\nThe results obtained here correspond generally with what is understood about landscape and population history in this watershed.

The districts studied included: Bald Eagle Area School District, Bellefonte Area School District, Penns Valley Area School District and State College Area School District. The study is organized around the following key research questions:\n(1) What have been the student enrollment trends for Regular Education and Special Education of Centre County students by school and by grade over the past five years? \n(2) What has been the fiscal impact of charter schools on each of the four school districts? \n(3) What, if any, impact on instruction, support, and extra-curricular programs has there been as a result of growing tuition payments to charter schools in each of the districts?  \n (4) Are there common threads among the experiences of the four school districts?\nThe methodology used included a mix of quantitative and qualitative research to better explain the complex nature of this study. Enrollment, financial and programming data were collected from varied sources including fiscal and enrollment data from the Pennsylvania Department of Education and individual school districts and from interviews with key district-level decision makers. The interviews were chiefly used to explain the quantitative data. The study found that charter school enrollments have coincided with enrollment declines in all four districts. The growing charter enrollments have obligated the districts to make tuition payments to charter schools in ever increasing amounts. These expenditure increases have been made up chiefly through taxes since the districts have not been able to realize efficiencies since the number of charter students in a given grade or school are insufficient to reduce staffing. The inability to accommodate for enrollment changes as well as other mandated and necessary expenditures has placed financial stress on the districts. Over time, programming changes and/or other efficiencies will need to be made if tuition costs continue to climb without adequate revenue sources. The implications of the research indicate a need for broader study across Pennsylvania followed by policy changes aligned to this research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9873], "author_name_tesi": "Griffith, Brian Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Griffith", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Hartman", "William Hartman", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Erica Frankenberg", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "William Hartman, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Erica Frankenberg, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["charter school", "tuition", "enrollment", "public school programming", "fiscal impact", "special education", "public school finance"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Characterization and Development of an Event-Driven Hybrid CMOS X-ray Detector", "id": "27239", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hybrid CMOS detectors (HCD) have provided great benefit to the infrared and optical fields of astronomy, and they are poised to do the same for X-ray astronomy.

Hybrid CMOS X-ray detectors offer low susceptibility to radiation damage, low power consumption, and fast readout time to avoid pile-up. The fast readout time is necessary for future high throughput X-ray missions. The Speedster-EXD X-ray HCD presented in this dissertation offers new in-pixel features and reduces known noise sources seen on previous generation HCDs. The Speedster-EXD detector makes a great step forward in the development of these detectors for future space missions.\nThis dissertation begins with an overview of future X-ray space mission concepts and their detector requirements. The background on the physics of semiconductor devices and an explanation of the detection of X-rays with these devices will be discussed followed by a discussion on CCDs and CMOS detectors. Next, hybrid CMOS X-ray detectors will be explained including their advantages and disadvantages. The Speedster-EXD detector and its new features will be outlined including its ability to only read out pixels which contain X-ray events. Test stand design and construction for the Speedster-EXD detector is outlined and the characterization of each parameter on two Speedster-EXD detectors is detailed including read noise, dark current, interpixel capacitance crosstalk (IPC), and energy resolution. Gain variation is also characterized, and a Monte Carlo simulation of its impact on energy resolution is described. This analysis shows that its effect can be successfully nullified with proper calibration, which would be important for a flight mission.

In prokaryotes, quinolinic acid is synthesized via the concerted action of two enzymes, L-aspartate oxidase, and quinolinate synthase (NadA).  L-aspartate oxidase, a flavin-dependent enzyme that converts L-aspartic acid to iminoaspartate, has been well-characterized.  In contrast, few studies have been conducted on NadA, which catalyzes a condensation reaction between iminoaspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form quinolinic acid.  Recent work has found that Escherichia coli NadA contains a [4Fe-4S]2+, and that this cluster may serve a direct role in catalysis.  Further support for the role of the iron-sulfur cluster in catalysis is established here through investigations of NadA from E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pyrococcus horikoshii.\n\tWhile initial work with E. coli NadA has established the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster, this work indicates its necessity for catalysis.  Isolation of a cluster-less apoprotein is described, and subsequent spectroscopic and activity analysis of the apoprotein indicates that is in fact unable to catalyze the formation of quinolinic acid.  Additionally, the cluster can be chemically reconstituted in this form of the protein, yielding a catalytically active form of NadA, with characteristics nearly identical to the holoprotein previously described.\nAn understanding of NadA from M. tuberculosis could be of use in designing new antimicrobial drugs to combat this deadly human pathogen.  Although the M. tuberculosis NadA sequence does not contain the CX2CX2C motif that is commonly found in 4Fe-4S enzymes it does possess an iron-sulfur cluster similar to that in E. coli.\n\tA recent report of the crystal structure of NadA from the archeon P. horikoshii describes catalytic activity of the protein in the absence of an iron-sulfur cluster.  To reproduce this observation independently, the P. horikoshii nadA gene was cloned and the protein purified under anaerobic conditions.   The isolated protein did in fact contain a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in its catalytically active form, while apoprotein, or protein isolated under aerobic conditions showed no activity.  The lack of cluster in the previously reported structure is believed to result from oxygen exposure.  To gain further understanding of this enzyme and the role of its cluster in catalysis, studies were initiated to obtain a crystal structure of the protein with an intact cluster.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [95], "author_name_tesi": "Griffiths, Amy E.", "last_name_ssi": "Griffiths", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J Booker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Squire J Booker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron-sulfur", "NadA", "quinolinate synthase"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Local Piezoelectric Behavior in PZT-Based Thin Films for Ultrasound Transducers\n\n", "id": "12274", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Piezoelectric microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are currently used in inkjet printers and precision resonators; numerous additional applications are being investigated for sensors, low-voltage actuators, and transducers. This work was aimed at improving piezoelectric MEMS by taking two approaches: 1) identifying factors affecting the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric thin films and 2) demonstrating integration of these films into a high frequency array transducer.\nIt was found that there are several key factors influencing the piezoelectric response of thin films for a given material composition. First, large grain size improves the piezoelectric response. This was demonstrated using chemical solution deposited lead nickel niobate \u2013 lead zirconate titanate (0.3)Pb(Ni<sub>0.33</sub>Nb<sub>0.67</sub>)O<sub>3</sub> - (0.7)Pb(Zr<sub>0.45</sub>Ti<sub>0.55</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), (PNN-PZT) ferroelectric thin films. It was shown that this composition allows greater microstructural control than does PZT. Dielectric permittivities ranging from 1350 to 1520 and a transverse piezoelectric coefficient e<sub>31,f</sub> as high as \u2013 9.7 C/m<sup>2</sup> were observed for films of about 0.25 &#956;m in thickness. The permittivity and piezoelectric response as well as extrinsic contributions to the dielectric constant increased by 14 and 12 % respectively for samples with grain sizes ranging from 110 to 270 nm.\nA second factor influencing the piezoelectric response is film composition with respect to the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). The composition dependence of the dielectric and piezoelectric nonlinearities was characterized in epitaxially grown (0.3)Pb(Ni<sub>0.33</sub>Nb<sub>0.67</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>-(0.7)Pb(Zr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) thin films deposited on SrTiO<sub>3</sub> to minimize the influence of large-angle grain boundaries. Tetragonal, MPB and rhombohedral films were prepared by changing the Zr/Ti ratio. The largest dielectric and piezoelectric nonlinearities were observed for the rhombohedral sample; this resulted from a higher domain wall mobility due to a smaller ferroelectric distortion and superior crystal quality.\nThirdly, changes in the mechanical boundary conditions experienced by a ferroelectric thin film were found to influence both the properties and the length scale for correlated motion of domain walls. Microfabrication was employed to release the PZT films from the Si substrate. Nonlinear piezoelectric maps, by band excitation piezoforce microscopy, showed formation of clusters of higher nonlinear activities of similar size for clamped PZT films with different microstructures. However PZT films that had been released from the Si substrate showed a distinct increase in the correlation length associated with coupled domain wall motion, suggesting that the local mechanical boundary conditions, more than microstructure or composition govern the domain wall dynamics. Release of both the local and the global stress states in films produced dielectric nonlinearities comparable to those of bulk ceramics.\nThe second research direction was targeted at demonstrating the functionality of a one dimensional transducer array. A diaphragm geometry was used for the transducer arrays in order to benefit from the unimorph-type displacement of the PZT-SiO<sub>2</sub> layers. For this purpose, the PZT and remaining films in the stack were patterned using reactive ion etching and partially released from the underlying silicon substrate by XeF<sub>2</sub> etching from the top. Admittance measurements on the fabricated structures showed resonance frequencies at ~40 MHz for a 80 &#956;m diameter-wide diaphragms with a PZT thickness of 1.74 &#956;m. In-water transmit and receive functionalities were demonstrated. A bandwidth on receive of 80 % centered at 40 MHz was determined during pitch-mode tests.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1977], "author_name_tesi": "Griggio, Flavio ", "last_name_ssi": "Griggio", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Flavio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Clive A Randall", "Thomas R Shrout"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PZT", "thin films", "ultrasound transducer", "piezo-force microscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Career Pathways of Female Superintendents:  Perceived Barriers and Supports", "id": "22750", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10264", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this particular study was to investigate the career pathways of women toward the superintendency and to examine the perceived barriers and supports that may have influenced their attainment of this position of educational leadership.

The estimated available tectonic forces are insufficient to initiate rupture, which suggests a weakening mechanism such as magmatism and/or dike intrusions is assisting rift development. Magmatism can thermally weaken the lithosphere and thus enable continental rupture to occur at a lower tectonic stress. To determine if there is seismic evidence for thermal perturbations in the upper mantle, I investigated the P- and S-wave velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath the northern end of the Lake Malawi Rift basin and Rungwe Volcanic Province (RVP). The upper mantle velocity structure has been tomographically imaged using P- and S-wave relative arrival time residuals from earthquakes recorded on the SEGMeNT seismic network and several previous networks in eastern Africa. Tomographic images of P- and S-wave velocity models reveal a prominent low wave speed anomaly (LWA) with reductions in Vp of 1.5 - 2.2% and Vs of 2 - 3% beneath the RVP between depths of ~50 to 300 km. This LWA can be attributed to a 100 - 200 K thermal anomaly. The tomographic images indicate that there is no basin wide ( > 75 km) thermal anomaly extending beneath the northern part of the Lake Malawi rift from the RVP. However, the presence of localized heating and/or magmatic modification of the lithosphere beneath the Lake Malawi rift from magmatic activity such as dike swarms and small pockets of melt on a sub-basin scale cannot be ruled out. Three geodynamic models for the origin of the LWA beneath the RVP, superplume, lithospheric drip, and small-scale convection, are examined. The lithospheric drip and small-scale convection models cannot readily explain magmatism in the RVP and thus are not favored. In examining the superplume model, a direct connection is not seen in the tomographic models between the African superplume and the RVP LWA. However, the LWA could be linked to the superplume structure by a small upwelling that is too narrow to be imaged or alternatively, via a small thermal plumelet that rose from the superplume structure in the mantle transition zone.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14363], "author_name_tesi": "Grijalva, Ashley Nichole", "last_name_ssi": "Grijalva", "middle_name_ssi": "Nichole", "first_name_ssi": "Ashley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Nyblade", "Charles Ammon", "Christelle Wauthier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Nyblade, Thesis Advisor", "Charles Ammon, Committee Member", "Christelle Wauthier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seismology", "crust", "mantle", "east african rift zone", "velocity", "tomography", "rift"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Religious Regulation\u2019s Impact on Religious Persecution: The Effects of De Facto and De Jure Religious Regulation", "id": "6622", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "692", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Religious persecution is a form of social conflict that has attracted the attention of social scientists and policy makers in recent years.

All photocatalytic systems contain 3 components: a photochemical module that harnesses the sun\u2019s energy, a catalytic module that generates H2, and a means of linking the two modules together.  To this end a hybrid biological system has been designed that incorporates a dithiol molecular wire to connect the terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster of Photosystem I (the photochemical module) with either a Pt or Au nanoparticle (the catalytic module).  The sulfhydryl group at one end of the molecular wire allows for the functionalization the nanoparticles via a metal-sulfide (either Au-S or Pt-S) bond and the other sulfhydryl group can chemically rescue the [4Fe-4S] cluster, of Photosystem I, thereby generating a strong coordination bond.  The use of sacrificial electron donors enables this bioconjugate system to evolve H2 when continuously illuminated.  \n\nIn an effort to maximize H2 production, the pH and ionic concentration of the solution, the mobility of the electron donor, the length and degree of saturation of the molecular wire, and the intensity of the light were systematically investigated. Optimal conditions included a solution buffered at pH 6.0, cross-linked plastocyanin, rebuilt spinach PS I, and the use of 1,4-benzenedithiol to connect PS I to the Pt nanoparticle. Illumination of this optimized Photosystem I/dithiol molecular wire/nanoparticle bioconjugate at a light intensity of 70 &#956;E m-2 s-1 generated H2 at a rate of 312 &#956;mol H2 mg Chl-1 h-1 over the course of 24 hours. \n\nThe success of these studies has led to the belief that a functional device that utilizes these PS I/molecular wire/nanoparticle bioconjugates could be constructed.  Unfortunately, inherent inefficiencies exist within this system due to the use of sacrificial electron donors and the reliance on diffusion chemistry for delivery of electrons to PS I.  By directly linking the bioconjugates to an electrode surface, a cathodic half-cell would be created that would be capable of generating H2 when illuminated.  Initial studies have been conducted to look at the interactions between PS I and a gold electrode surface.  Ellipsometric measurements and atomic force microscope imaging have revealed that PS I generally maintains its native structure and forms relatively dense monolayers on both \u2013hydroxyl and \u2013carboxyl terminated alkanthiol-capped gold surfaces.  This technology could easily be transitioned into a device that incorporates the PS I/molecular wire/nanoparticle bioconjugates for photocatalytic H2 production.  \n\n\n \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5338], "author_name_tesi": "Grimme, Rebecca Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Grimme", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Thesis Advisor", "John H Golbeck, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["photocatalytic hydrogen production"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Development and Applications of Computational Enzyme Engineering Tools", "id": "15087mjg5185", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Proteins are biological polymers that have diverse functions, including antibodies that protect the body from viruses, transport proteins that regulate intracellular ion concentrations, and enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. Despite their natural prevalence, many instances still remain where an environmentally available protein does not exist, or is not known, for a given application. In these instances, it is possible to use protein engineering techniques to address a specific application. While purely experimental approaches are readily available to engineer proteins, these methods are often laborious or infeasible for more complicated systems. Computational protein engineering procedures can screen larger numbers of protein variants and direct the designed variants to promising regions of the sequence space. \n\nThe Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization procedure (IPRO) is a computational protein engineering tool that incorporates random backbone perturbations with deterministic amino acid selection procedures, followed by several steps to refine the protein-ligand structure, to improve or reduce binding for a given target, or multiple targets. First, relationships were derived between computationally-accessible interaction energies and enzyme catalytic properties, namely KM, kcat, and kcat/KM. Through the use of these relationships, which were validated using existing literature, a new computational procedure named OptZyme was developed to redesign enzymes using the IPRO framework. Several methods for diverse applications, ranging from de novo antibody design to binding site translocation, incorporated the IPRO framework and were assembled into a single platform so that these programs can be more easily accessed and used by users. OptZyme was used within this updated platform to improve substrate specificity (i.e., KM) for medium-chain fatty acyl-ACPs. By tailoring the chain length of the substrate, the chemical properties of the produced free fatty acids are changed. Mutations that form a continuous hydrophobic surface with the \u03c9-1 atom of an acyl-ACP were shown to be selective for that chain length. Finally, the ability to anaerobically oxidize methane to create liquid fuels is presumed to be kinetically-limited, but as of yet, the step that controls the net oxidation rate has not been firmly established. Multiple scenarios were devised that considered plausible limiting steps for the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Two of the case studies focused on improving catalysis by using OptZyme, while another used a simple IPRO formulation to alter cofactor specificity. Based on a detailed literature review, the rate of product unbinding from the active site of methyl-coenzyme M reductase was suggested to limit methane oxidation kinetics.  For the final case study, a novel amino acid selection step was developed to consider multiple design criteria at once. It was used to improve the rate of product release for methyl-coenzyme M reductase and suggested large, multi-conformational, hydrophobic side chains. By improving the rate of methane oxidation, the economics of methane-to-liquid fuel bioconversion becomes more propitious.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16340], "author_name_tesi": "Grisewood, Matthew Jeffery", "last_name_ssi": "Grisewood", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeffery", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Costas D Maranas", "Michael John Janik", "Howard M Salis", "James Gregory Ferry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Howard M Salis, Committee Member", "James Gregory Ferry, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization", "IPRO", "Computational", "Enzyme", "Redesign", "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase", "acyl-ACP thioesterase", "Mcr", "'TesA", "OptZyme", "Optimization", "beta-glucuronidase", "Protein engineering", "Specificity", "Activity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "OptZyme: a computational tool for altering enzymatic specificity", "id": "17673", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8544", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "OptZyme is a new computational procedure that is designed to improve enzymatic activity (i.e., kcat   or kcat/KM) with a novel substrate.  The key concept here is to use transition state analogue (TSA) compounds, which are known for many enzymatic reactions, as substitutes for the typically unknown transition state (TS) structures. Mutations that minimize the interaction energy of the enzyme with its TSA, rather than with its substrate, are identified that lower the transition state energy barrier.  Using results of Escherichia coli \u03b2-glucuronidase as a benchmark, we confirm that KM correlates (R2 = 0.960) with the interaction energy between Escherichia coli \u03b2-glucuronidase and para-nitrophenyl- \u03b2 D-glucuronide, kcat/KM correlates (R2 = 0.864) with the interaction energy of the transition state analogue molecule, D-glucaro-1, 5-lactone, and kcat correlates (R2 = 0.854) with a weighted combination of interaction energies with para-nitrophenyl- \u03b2, D-glucuronide and D-glucaro-1, 5-lactone. OptZyme is subsequently used to identify mutants with improved KM, kcat, and kcat/KM, respectively for the new substrate, para-nitrophenyl- \u03b2, D-galactoside. Differences between the three libraries shed light onto structural differences that underpin improved KM, kcat, or kcat/KM. Mutants predicted to enhance activity of pNP-GAL were mostly those that indirectly or directly helped create hydrogen bonds with the altered sugar ring conformation or its substituents, namely H162S, L361G, W549R, and N550S.

While engineers are able to evaluate efficiency and monetary costs quantitatively, safety is too often evaluated qualitatively. Funding for transportation safety improvement projects is limited so it is important to estimate the safety effectiveness of improvements and select those that produce the greatest benefit.\n\n\nCase-control and cohort methods are proposed and evaluated to estimate the safety effectiveness of lane and shoulder width on rural, two-lane highways. These methods produce estimates of the odds ratio and relative risk, respectively. The odds ratio and relative risk represent the expected percent change in the probability of a crash due to a particular risk factor. In highway safety, crash modification factors (CMFs) represent the expected percent change in crash frequency for a given geometric improvement. There is a need for better methods to estimate CMFs or alternative measures of safety effectiveness and epidemiological designs appear well suited for this task.\n\n\nThis research reviews the strengths and weaknesses of the case-control and cohort approaches and evaluates their potential for estimating the safety effectiveness of geometric design elements. Empirical examples are provided using geometric, traffic and crash data from Pennsylvania and Washington. Safety effectiveness is estimated for lane and shoulder width, and compared to CMFs developed in the Highway Safety Manual to test the validity of the methods.\n\n\nModels were initially estimated without adjustment for confounding variables, and the estimated safety effectiveness for lane and shoulder width was inconsistent with CMFs in the Highway Safety Manual. ADT, speed and segment length were identified as important confounders when estimating safety effectiveness for lane and shoulder width. Models were then developed with adjustment for ADT, speed, and segment length; results were consistent with the Highway Safety Manual indicating a general decrease in crash risk as lane and shoulder width increase. These findings were consistent for both the case-control and cohort designs.

The success of email as a professional communication tool clearly indicates that email is powerful and adaptable, but the success has led to the need for strategies to cope with the quantity and importance of email. The goal of this research was to develop a theory of how email is used, and from that goal, to develop a tool that will improve email interactions. The tool allows users to triage new mail, search existing mail, and categorize their email according to social clusters. These clusters are groups of senders/recipients with some association, as determined through collocation on multiple email messages.\nThe tool, SCuF (Social Cluster Filtering), is an extension of Microsoft Outlook 2003. It uses an extension of an existing algorithm (k-nearest-neighbor clustering) to derive a user-defined number of clusters of associated emailers. The user can then edit these clusters and use them to filter their inbox, another folder, or multiple folders. The filtered view only presents the user with messages to or from the members of the social cluster. The concept of social clustering extends the idea of social networks, and I present an analysis of extant work on social network analysis of email, showing that this dissertation research was novel and addressed problems that are not addressed by prior research.\nThis work was rooted in a theoretical foundation that draws from cognitive psychology and the semiotics of information. Cognitive psychology, and particularly cognitive and process models, allowed me to explore the cognitive mechanisms that people use when they interact with and make sense of the information contained within email messages. Semiotics of information allowed me to explore the visual and conceptual mechanisms that people use in these processes. Using analysis techniques from both psychology and semiotics, I created models of existing behavior and mechanisms, and extend these models to create a theoretically valid extension. \nThe models originated from fieldwork on how high-throughput email users actually use email. I focused on high-throughput users because they present a special case of intensive interaction with email. I provide data to define these users, and then present data from several in-depth interviews and observations of these users. Finally, I used high-throughput users in an evaluation of the tool.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2549], "author_name_tesi": "Gross, Joshua B", "last_name_ssi": "Gross", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Frank Edward Ritter", "John Millar Carroll", "Richard Alan Carlson", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Beth Rosson, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Chair", "Frank Edward Ritter, Committee Member", "John Millar Carroll, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["artificial intelligence", "social networks", "human computer interaction", "email", "clustering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Electrochemical Activity and Patterning of \nFunctionalized Carbon Nanotubes\n\n\n\n", "id": "11287", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been shown to be useful in applications ranging from sensing cancer cells to the production of electricity.  However, to be useful in many applications, carbon nanotubes must undergo post-synthesis modification.  These modifications take carbon nanotubes from their virgin state with primarily sp2 hyridized carbon and transform them into functional niche molecules and materials that can be further processed for specific uses.  Modifications can include chemical functionalization, non-covalent asociations, or decoration by metal nanoparticles, among other methods.  With many potential modification routes, it is important to understand the implications of these changes on the bulk properties of CNTs. When functionalizing CNTs, reactions are dependant on CNT size, chirality, and dispersion, thus, yielding a distribution of CNTs in bulk samples.  It is known that covalent functionalization of singularly isolated CNTs changes their intrinsic behavior from a metallic state to semi-conducting state, but the effect that this change has on the conductivity and electrochemical performance of macroscopic samples has yet to be fully explored.  In this thesis, the electrical and electrochemical properties of covalently functionalized CNTs were explored, and the ability to control and create defined patterns of surfactant-stabilized CNTs was demonstrated.  Additonally, nanoparticle functionalized CNTs were used as electrodes to create a planar fuel cell.\nCNT-based electrodes were created using a mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane filtering process.  Electrodes made included unmodified raw tubes, covalently functionalized tubes, and tubes with metal nanoparticles.  These electrodes underwent electrochemical characterization in an aqueous environment.  The results show that the electrochemical kinetics of diazonium functionalized CNTs are dramatically affected as compared to their pure state.  An anodic/cathodic peak separation of 0.46 V for purified CNTs increased to 1.13 V upon functionalization, indicating decreased electron transfer in the functionalized nanotubes as compared to the unfunctionalized sample.  This decrease in electrochemical electron-transfer kinetics can be attributed to the steric hindrance between the Fe(CN)6 3-/4- complex and the surface phenyl moieties on the functionalized CNTs.  The diazonium functionalization reaction used in this work has been shown to attach a moiety to every 1 in 9 carbons, thus providing sufficient sidewall coverage which hindered access to the CNT surface.  Electrical characterization of bulk CNT films shows that there was also a change in the conductivity of the samples upon functionalization.  Electrical measurements on nanotube mats were performed using a 4-point probe measurement.  The electrical conductivity of functionalized samples decreased from 545 S cm-1 for unmodified CNTs to 134 S cm-1 and 77 S cm-1 for BrCNTs and NO2CNTs, respectively.\n Micron-scale conductive planar arrays were fabricated by assembly of carbon nanotube (CNT)/polydiallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (PDADMAC) thin films on interdigitated patterns using a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process from aqueous solutions.  The LbL hybrid film was assembled on a quaternized surface pattern of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS), which was defined on a Si wafer substrate using microcontact printing or drop coating.  Deposition of the CNT/polymer bilayers was shown to be limited to the quaternized APTMS regions as confirmed by Raman microspectroscopic mapping, optical and atomic force microscopy, and electrical probe measurements.  Patterns of three, five, and eight bilayers had conductivities ranging from 30 to 130 S cm-1 for the hybrid structures, depending on number of bilayers and measurement technique, which agrees with other reported values for CNT/polymer thin film composites.\nCNTs functionalized with Pt and Au nanoparticles were tested for their electrocatalytic behavior in oxygen reduction and methanol oxidation.  Nanoparticle functionalization was confirmed using TEM and XRD, which showed an average metal particle size of 5 nm to 25 nm on the tubes.  The samples were found to have conductivities comparable to that measured for unmodified CNTs of ~550 S cm-1. On a standard rotating disk glassy carbon electrode, the PtCNTs were active for MeOH oxidation (AuCNT showed little or no MOR activity) while the AuCNTs were as active as the PtCNTs for ORR in 0.5 M KOH.  Two-dimensional electrodes (2DE) of the Pt/Au CNTs were created on glass substrates using a MCE membrane cut and paste technique.  The 2DE\u2019s were shown to be an effective geometry for creating a membraneless, passive, mixed-fuel, two-dimensional fuel cell.  A stable open circuit voltage of 0.31 V was recorded with a maximum power produced of 0.05 mW cm-1.  This data confirms that the planar electrodes were in electrochemical communication with one another and this strategy may be used to build planar electrochemical devices.\nThis thesis demonstrates the utility of functionalization and resulting properties of CNTs as used in electrodes.  Functionalization can be used to control bandgaps, electrical conductivity, modulate electrochemical electron-transfer, improve catalytic activity, and also to control the deposition of CNTs for patterning.

Many systems stand to benefit from these switches, and other RF MEMS devices. A significant drawback to MEMS switches so far has been the high actuation voltages, typically greater than 50V. This work has empirically confirmed that exploiting piezoelectric actuation offers a considerable advantage over electrostatics. A switching time of 2 ms was measured with only 30 volts applied. This is one of the fastest reported switching speeds for MEMS device, as well as a comparatively low actuation voltage. \n\nThe piezoelectric switches in this study were designed based on unimorph cantilevered bender actuators. Electrical switching was accomplished by a metal contact on the end of the actuator that makes and breaks a connection with a gold transmission line. A low-stress silicon nitride was used as the structural layer. Sol-gel deposited lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films were selected as the actuation material due to their comparatively high piezoelectric response. These films exhibited good ferroelectric properties with remanent polarizations of 20-25 mC/cm2 and coercive fields of 50 kV/cm. Gold interdigitated electrodes were used to pole and drive the microactuators and switches. The PZT, and remaining films in the stack, were patterned using ion-beam etching. Hard chromium and titanium masks, used in conjunction with oxygen, were developed for ion milling, and found to have an etch-rate selectivity over PZT of roughly 3 to 1. The devices were released by etching sacrificial silicon in gas-phase xenon difluoride. \n\nReleased cantilevers had a propensity for upward curvature due to unbalanced residual stresses in the films. A systematic approach, based on varying the PZT thickness, was devised to produce flat cantilevers, and ultimately, functioning switches. An investigation into the stress mechanisms was undertaken to gain insight into the stress mechanisms with the aim of improving yield. The study revealed that the stress of the sol-gel deposited zirconia was not stable when exposed to the atmosphere. Presumably, this was a result of hydration due to the porous nature of the film. Reactively sputtered titania films were explored as an alternative barrier layer. PZT films deposited on 100 nm of titania exhibited good ferroelectric properties, comparable to those deposited on zirconia. Unimorph actuators using titania were fabricated, and the field-induced deflection was measured. Due to the symmetric nature of the bimorph, and its predicted superior performance, this structure was explored as an alternative to the unimorph. It was found that the curvature of these structures could be controlled post-release by increasing the annealing temperature. Based on these initial results, bimorph actuators look very promising for MEMS switches. \n\nThe deflection of a zirconia buffered actuator, 280mm in length, was measured to be 10 mm at 100 volts (160 kV/cm). A 280 mm long titania actuator exhibited a 15 mm at 200 volts (333 kV/cm). A switch with a tapered geometry was used to measure the transmitted RF power as function of frequency, and was found to have an isolation of more than 60 dB up to 10 MHz.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5608], "author_name_tesi": "Gross, Steven Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Gross", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Kenji Uchino", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEMS", "PZT", "microfabrication", "etching", "cantilevers", "xenon difluoride", "ion beam etching", "piezoelectric", "actuators", "unimorph", "bimorph"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Student Organization Advising and its Impact on Individual Student Leaders, Student Organizations, and Student Organization Advisors", "id": "13689jbg165", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13689", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the contributions student organization advisors make towards successful student organizations.

During that same time period, professional development school partnerships between school districts and institutions of higher learning have been seen as a vehicle for transforming or renewing both basic and higher education. It is reasonable to expect that the establishment of a professional development school partnership would exert a significant impact on the professional development program of the district.  However, this may not be the case. In fact, Levine (1997) argued, \u201cschool districts, with some important exceptions, continue to ignore the potential impact that professional development schools can have in terms of professional development, recruitment, and new teacher induction\u201d (p.6).  The purpose of this study was to address empirically the question of the impact of a PDS partnership on a district\u2019s professional development program.\n\tThe central research question framing this study was: What has been the impact of an elementary professional development school partnership on the professional development program of the school district at the elementary level? \nIn order to answer this central research question, the following sub-questions guided the study:\n1) As individuals in a variety of roles and contexts perceive it\u2014has the elementary professional development program in the school district changed as a result of the PDS partnership?\n2) If changes in professional development have occurred at the elementary level, in what areas have the changes occurred?\na) Assumptions underlying professional development\nb) Goals for professional development\nc) Delivery of professional development \nd) Role of the teacher in professional development\ne) Outcomes of professional development \n\t3) What factors explain the changes that have occurred? \nThe study employed a qualitative case study approach. In-depth interviews using an interview protocol adapted from Seidman were conducted with 25 participants from three distinct categories: 1) central office administrators including curriculum coordinators; 2) principals, and 3) teachers using Seidman\u2019s interview protocol. Data were analyzed using the constant-comparative method (Glasser & Strauss, 1967). \nAs revealed from the data collected during this study, all of the participant groups with the exception of the low involvement teacher participants, perceived that the professional development school partnership offered and supported multiple opportunities for professional development including enhanced teacher leadership possibilities, generating a culture of inquiry, and empowerment through teacher-generated and teacher-led professional development. \nThe findings of the study indicate multiple opportunities for future research studies in regards to professional development, school-university partnerships, and teacher leadership and principal leadership in a PDS partnership. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12883], "author_name_tesi": "Grove, Doris Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Grove", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Doris", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James F.

We investigated the effect of the major green tea polyphenol, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on high fat diet induced obesity in male C57BL/6J mice. We hypothesized that the supplementation of a high fat diet with EGCG would reverse or prevent metabolic syndrome in this model. \nObese mice were treated with high fat diet containing 0.32% EGCG for 6 weeks. There was a significant decrease in body weight gain in EGCG-treated mice compared to high fat-fed obese mice (44.0% decrease, p<0.01). In addition, obese mice fed high fat diet containing EGCG had significantly decreased fasting blood glucose levels (16.7% decrease at week 14, p<0.05), fasting plasma insulin levels (22.7% decrease, p<0.05) and insulin resistance as measured by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (29%, p<0.05) compared to high fat-fed controls. Short-term EGCG treatment increased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (28.6% increase, p<0.05) and the ratio of HDL to non-HDL cholesterol (46.1% increase, p<0.05) compared to high fat-fed mice. In addition, plasma adiponectin levels were increased (14.3% increase, p<0.05) compared to high fat mice. \nTreatment of high fat-fed lean C57BL/6J mice with 0.32% EGCG for 15 weeks reduced final body weight compared to those fed a high fat diet (9.4% decrease, p<0.05). EGCG treatment also reduced fasting blood glucose (18.5% decrease at week 14, p<0.01) and plasma insulin (25.3% decrease, p<0.05) compared to high fat-fed controls. Insulin resistance as estimated by HOMA-IR was also significantly reduced by EGCG treatment (33.9% decrease, p<0.05). \nIn both studies, EGCG treatment ameliorated the development of fatty liver disease. A 49-51% decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase levels and a 21-23% decrease in liver weights were observed. EGCG treatment of high fat-fed lean mice decreased final liver triglycerides (27% decrease, p<0.05) and severity of hepatic lipidosis (27.2% decrease, p<0.05) compared to the high fat-fed control; however these effects were not observed following short-term treatment of obese mice with EGCG.\nBecause EGCG treatment increased fecal lipid content by 20 to 29.4%, we assessed the possible role of inhibition of pancreatic lipase (PL) as a mechanism for EGCG-mediated anti-obesity effects. PL is a key enzyme in lipid digestion. In vitro, EGCG dose-dependently inhibited PL with 50% inhibition at 7.5 \u00b5M. Kinetic analysis showed that EGCG inhibition was non-competitive with respect to substrate concentration. Black tea compounds were also examined. Theaflavin-3,3\u2019-gallate (TFdiG) was the most potent inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.45 \u00b5M, and also exhibited a non-competitive inhibition with respect to substrate concentration. In conclusion, EGCG supplementation reverses metabolic syndrome in obese mice and reduces development of metabolic syndrome in high fat-fed lean mice. Some of these effects may be explained by the observed inhibition of PL by EGCG. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3306], "author_name_tesi": "Grove, Kimberly A", "last_name_ssi": "Grove", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor", "Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pancreatic lipase", "metabolic syndrome", "obesity", "catechins", "Camellia sinensis", "Tea"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF BLOCK SCHEDULING ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT SCORES ON THE PENNSYLVANIA SYSTEM OF ASSESSMENT ELEVENTH GRADE MATH AND READING EXAMS\n\n", "id": "9782", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5095", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study quantitatively examined the effect of block scheduling on student achievement.

Antibiotics bind to this huge macromolecular machine, which is composed of both proteins and RNA, and disrupt its function, which is to synthesize proteins required for bacterial survival. Frequently, bacteria develop mechanisms to prevent antibiotics from binding to their ribosomes, which most often involve modifying or changing specific amino acid residues or nucleotides that line the antibiotic binding site. One such modification is the addition of a methyl (\u2013CH3) group to adenosine 2503 (A2503) of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This nucleotide is absolutely conserved, and is located within domain V of the ribosome which is the catalytic center where peptide bonds are formed. Methylation of carbon 2 of A2503 is catalyzed by the enzyme RlmN.  This modification is ubiquitous among prokaryotes, and like most modifications to the ribosome, is believed to be important in optimal functioning of the ribosome. Interestingly, the addition of a methyl group to carbon 8 of A2503 confers resistance to over seven classes of antibiotics, some of which are antibiotics of last resort for patients infected with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. This activity is encoded by the product of the cfr gene (Cfr), which has been found in MRSA isolated from hospitalized patients from numerous countries, portending a new and dangerous mechanism for the spread of antibiotic resistance.\nRlmN and Cfr have been predicted to be evolutionarily related, as well as belong to the radical SAM (RS) superfamily of enzymes. RS enzymes all utilize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), as a precursor to a potently oxidizing 5\u2019-deoxyadenosyl 5\u2019-radical (5\u2019-dA\u2022). The commonality among the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes is that the 5\u2019-dA\u2022 initiates catalysis by abstracting a key hydrogen atom from the substrate. Our studies on RlmN and Cfr have elucidated the chemical logic by which these enzymes are capable of installing a methyl group onto an unreactive, sp2-hybridized carbon, revealing a completely new strategy that expands the repertoire of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. \nTo elucidate the mechanistic strategy of RlmN and Cfr, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry in concert with isotopically labeled substrates to show that, unlike most RS enzymes, RlmN and Cfr are capable of activating SAM toward two distinct types of reactivities within a single active site. Interestingly, the first step in each reaction was shown to be the SAM-dependent methylation of a conserved cysteinyl residue, in the process making a methylcysteinyl residue that is subsequently activated by the 5\u2019-dA\u2022. The methylcysteinyl radical then adds to the nucleotide substrate, generating a radical enzyme\u2013substrate crosslink, which we were able to trap in Cfr and characterize by electron paramagnetic resonance and electron-nuclear double resonance spectroscopies. In addition we were able to show that cleave age of this radical enzyme\u2013substrate crosslink is driven by formation of a radical disulfide anion bond between the methyl-carrying Cys residue and another strictly conserved Cys residue, with concomitant release of the product from the protein. \nIn addition, through a collaboration with Professor Amy Rosenzweig at Northwestern University, we were able to determine the crystal structure of RlmN to 2.05 \u00c5, which allowed the visualization of the methylated cysteinyl residue predicted in our earlier biochemical studies.  \nPart II:  Characterization of Radical SAM-Dependent Dehydrogenases\nThe second part of this dissertation was the study of a different and unique class of RS enzymes, the RS dehydrogenases. These enzymes use radical chemistry to effect two-electron oxidations of organic substrates via intermediates containing single unpaired electrons. This unique reaction was predicted to contain multiple iron\u2013sulfur (Fe/S) cluster. All RS enzymes require 1 [4Fe\u20134S] cluster, which is ligated by cysteines found in the RS motif, CxxxCxxC.  The RS cluster interacts with SAM to facilitate its cleavage to the 5\u2019-dA\u2022.  The existence and the role of the additional cluster(s) were not as clear. This details the characterization of three enzymes from this class: AtsB, anSMEcpe, and BtrN. BtrN was previously shown to catalyze a key step in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic butirosin B, which is the oxidation of a secondary alcohol located on a deoxysugar to a ketone. AtsB and anSMEcpe, on the other hand, catalyze the oxidation of a seryl or cysteinyl residue on a cognate protein to a formylglycyl (FGly) residue. The FGly residue is found in arylsulfatases, where it plays a unique role as a cofactor catalyzing the hydrolysis of sulfate monoesters. We were able to shown that, in contrast to the majority of radical SAM enzymes, each of these proteins contains two or more [4Fe\u20134S] clusters that are absolutely required for turnover. In addition, the stoichiometry of the AtsB and anSMEcpe reactions was determined as well as the stereochemical course of their reactions; in both cases the pro-S hydrogen of the substrate is abstracted by the 5\u2019-dA\u2022.  In addition, several radical species have been trapped in reactions catalyzed by anSAMcpe which will allow a detail spectroscopic study of the active site. \nTo truly understand the role of the auxiliary cluster(s) in these reactions, we developed conditions for crystallizing both BtrN and anSMEcpe in the presence of substrates.  In collaboration with Professor Cathy Drennan (MIT) we solved the structure of both anSMEcpe and BtrN to a resolutions of ~1.6 \u00c5.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8411], "author_name_tesi": "Grove, Tyler L", "last_name_ssi": "Grove", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Tyler", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J Booker", "Squire J Booker", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Squire J Booker, Dissertation Advisor", "Squire J Booker, Committee Chair", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Radical", "Radical SAM", "Fe/S", "SPASM", "5'-dA", "SAM", "Methylation", "Antibiotic Resistance", "Cfr", "RlmN", "anSMEcpe", "radical SAM dehydrogenas"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ARC DISCHARGE SYNTHESIS AND MORPHOLOGY CONTROL OF EARLY TRANSITION METAL CARBIDE NANOPATICLES\n\n", "id": "10876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work is directed to the understanding of the synthesis and morphology control of early transition metal carbides.

Two types of LDH were synthesized: hydrotalcite and hydrocalumite by coprecipitation at room temperature or higher with different compositions of layers and interlayers.\nRemoval of 100% arsenate and 87.5% removal of arsenite with nitrate form of hydrotalcite and 99.9% of arsenate and 83.6% of arsenite with nitrate form of hydrocalumite were achieved. Chloride and carbonate forms of hydrotalcite and chloride form of hydrocalumite removed 50-90% of these oxyanions.\nThe uptake capacity of LDH synthesized by different methods was also compared. Layered double hydroxides synthesized by co-precipitation method had greater uptake capacity than those synthesized by hydrothermal method because of smaller crystal size in the former. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed greater crystallinity of LDH synthesized by hydrothermal method than those synthesized by coprecipitation method. These results suggest that oxyanion uptake is less in the case of well crystallized hydrothermally synthesized LDH compared to that of the poorly crystallized materials because it is more difficult to break electrostatic bonds in the former than in the latter.\nHigher oxyanion uptake was observed with calcined LDH than with commercially available un-calcined carbonate form of LDH.

Two studies which are described in the five chapters of this thesis, assessed long-term cropping systems effects on soil aggregate stability, corn grain yields, and yield stability in a 36-year-old crop rotation and fertility experiment, named the Hunter Rotation Experiment (HRE).In the first study, we evaluated long-term effects of ten different crops grown in four cropping systems of HRE on soil aggregate stability, estimated by water-stable aggregates (WSA), during four months of a growing season. Water-stable aggregates depend on temporary binding agents such as roots and fungi which are affected by crop management. Because annual plants support shorter live-root periods, we hypothesized that WSA would be higher in soils under perennials (PR) and double-cropped small grains (SG) than in soils under summer annuals in annual systems (SAa), and summer annuals in perennial and diverse systems (SAp). We also hypothesized that WSA would fluctuate more during a growing season in soils under summer annual crops than in soils under PR and SG. Further, the live-root period in a cropping system and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) would predict WSA better than total soil organic carbon and tillage frequency. \nWe sampled soils of 10 crops from four cropping systems managed under inorganic fertilizers in the HRE: two annual systems: two annual systems: continuous corn (Zea mays L.), corn-soybean [Glycine max (L) Merr.]; a perennial system: 4yr corn-4yr alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.); and a diverse system: corn-oats (Avena sativa L.)/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-2yr red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)+ timothy (Phleum pratense L.) in spring, summer and autumn, 2005. We measured % WSA by slaking and wet-sieving the air-dried 1-2 mm aggregates in water. \nThe WSA under PR, SG and SAp were respectively 106%, 107%, and 84% higher than under SAa. The WSA under SAp did not differ from the WSA under PR and SG, indicating a more pronounced cropping system effect than individual crop-effect. Water-stable aggregates varied more under the summer annual crops than under PR and SG from spring-autumn. Estimated live-root period predicted WSA best along with soil water content and SMBC (R2= 0.95). \nThe second study evaluated average corn grain yields, yield trends and yield stability in the four cropping systems under three fertility regimes of the HRE during 1990-2005. We hypothesized that corn yields would be higher, more stable and increase more over time in: i) perennial and diverse cropping systems compared to annual systems, and ii) manure-fertility compared to inorganic-fertility regimes. Fertility regimes were inorganic, or manure based on crop N- or P-needs. \nMean yields in 4C4A and COW2RT were 10-12% higher than CC and 7% higher in 4C4A than CS. Yield increases over time did not differ (0.28 Mg ha-1 yr-1) among all treatments. Coefficient of variation (CV) analysis, however, indicated that yield variability was significantly higher in CC (CV = 28%) than in 4C4A (CV = 21%) across fertility regimes. \nAccording to regression stability analysis, response of corn yields to the environmental conditions did not differ among four cropping systems within inorganic and P-based manure fertility. Under N-based manure fertility, however, yields diverged between CC and other systems in the poorest-yielding year but converged in the highest-yielding year. Response of corn yields to the environmental conditions did not differ between manure- and inorganic-fertility, but yields were 7% higher under manure-fertility in the poorest-yielding year. \nThe results indicate that perennial and diverse cropping systems that rotate corn with perennials and winter double-cropped small grains, can promote higher soil aggregate stability than a corn-soybean or continuous corn system. Compared to CC, perennial and diverse systems are likely to produce higher yields across three fertility regimes, and more stable yields under N-based manure fertility.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3444], "author_name_tesi": "Grover, Kulbhushan K.", "last_name_ssi": "Grover", "middle_name_ssi": "K.", "first_name_ssi": "Kulbhushan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Wayne Roth", "Heather D Karsten", "Douglas D Archibald", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "David Eissenstat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member", "Heather D Karsten, Committee Chair", "Douglas D Archibald, Committee Member", "Sjoerd Willem Duiker, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Yield trends", "Soil quality", "Cropping system", "Crop rotation", "Soil aggregate stability", "Corn grain yields", "Yield stability", "Soil organic carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Hematocrit and Rotation Time on Platelet Adhesion to a Polyurethane Urea Surface", "id": "18065", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8618", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death in the United States since 1900.  CVD affects nearly 82.6 million American adults, and, on average, it claims one life every 39 seconds.  Ventricular assist devices are a viable option for sustaining patients awaiting cardiac transplantation, but postoperative complications, such as bleeding, infection, and thrombosis, still remain an issue.  Platelet adhesion to the plasma protein-coated polyurethane urea (PUU) blood sac in the Penn State 50 cc ventricular assist device is a primary event in thrombosis.  Prior to adhesion, platelets must be convected to the material surface.  Red blood cells have been shown to increase platelet diffusivity as a function of shear rate through localized mixing and cell-cell collisions and as a function of shear rate and hematocrit through platelet margination.  In this study, we aim to determine the effects of hematocrit (Hct) and rotation time on platelet adhesion to PUU.  A rotating disk system is used to provide a steady waveform to the PUU surface.  The disk is rotated in either 20% Hct or 40% Hct reconstituted whole bovine blood for 0.5, 1, or 2 hours.  Adhered platelets are immunofluorescently labeled with a primary CAPP2A mouse anti-bovine antibody and a secondary Alexa-Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG, and the PUU material is imaged at specific locations using confocal microscopy.  The shear rate at each imaging location is experimentally determined using laser Doppler velocimetry.  Platelet adhesion is quantified by the average platelet counts at each radial location and by calculating an adhesion coefficient from the average platelet count, platelet flux, and rotation time.  The platelet fluxes and raw counts are lowest at the disk centers and increase logarithmically with shear rate.  The platelet counts are an order of magnitude greater in whole blood than platelet rich plasma.

The geography of health and disease is a domain that has great potential to benefit from such interactive visualization.  Geographical information systems (GIS) have already become a substantial visual tool to assist medical geographers, public health planners, epidemiologists, and others working with spatial distribution of health related data. Geovisualization builds on the utility of traditional GIS through a design meant to elicit data exploration from the user.  Users can observe relationships not only across space but also examine relationships between multiple variables and over time.  Geovisualization has proven to be useful for exploratory data analysis in epidemiology and public health, but it has yet to be adopted by epidemiologists and public health practitioners as a widely accepted method to explore or analyze epidemiological data.  Facilitating adoption requires fitting the tool to the user and their tasks.  This research is part of that larger goal to fit geovisualization tools to the needs of epidemiological analysts.  Through in-depth case studies with epidemiological data researchers using a geovisualization application for data exploration and analysis, I address 1) what tasks these experts engage in while working in a geovisualization tool, 2) how they approach accomplishing their tasks, and 3) what tools, features or statistics are necessary to support their data exploration.  Using task models (Knapp 1995), I organize and present the tasks of these epidemiological analysts, as well as the physical actions they took toward achieving the tasks, mental actions during the process of doing the tasks, and the visual operators utilized to achieve understanding to complete the task.  Analyzing these task models for contiguity between their components, characteristics among the models and between the two participants, and what types of issues prevented the participants from moving forward in their tasks, led to the identification of five broad classes of functions necessary within a geovisualization application in order to enable completion of user tasks:  1) filters and selections, 2) making comparisons, 3) seeking statistical feedback, 4) analyzing more than two variables at a time and 5) exporting information (visually or as a table).  I also established that there are several factors that influence how a user approaches accomplishing a task.  Those factors include 1) the users\u2019 visualization goals and the flexibility they have to address their goals via access to data and changing data, 2) what part of the research process they are in with the data they are exploring, 3) their experience and training with GIS and spatial methods, and 4) their usual methods of inquiry outside ESTAT.  The in-depth case studies presented in this thesis provide examples of the utility of geovisualization for health-related research, and contribute evidence toward ways geovisualization can improve to meet epidemiological users\u2019 needs.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [23], "author_name_tesi": "Gruver, Adrienne Brook", "last_name_ssi": "Gruver", "middle_name_ssi": "Brook", "first_name_ssi": "Adrienne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Cynthia Ann Brewer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer, Thesis Advisor", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["exploratory spatial data analysis", "epidemiology", "geovisualization", "tasks"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING PRIVATE FOREST LANDOWNERS\u2019 EXPERIENCES AS THEY PLAN FOR THEIR FORESTS\u2019 FUTURE", "id": "11117", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2568", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forests dominate Pennsylvania covering nearly 60 percent of its landscape. An estimated 750,000 private forest landowners (PFLs) hold 70 percent (more than 12 million acres) of this forest. The number of PFLs increases each year as landowners divide and sell or gift away their forestland. As forestland ownerships increase and change, the potential for urban development increases. The decision making processes PFLs engage when planning for their forestland\u2019s future are not well understood. Recent statewide survey results indicate over 52 percent of PFLs plan to leave forestland to more than one heir. Further, approximately 9 percent are planning to subdivide, 27 percent are planning to sell, and 11 percent expressed interest in conservation easements. Using key informant, phenomenological, and semi-structured interviews, this dissertation explores PFLs\u2019 motivations and decision-making processes as they plan for the future of their forestland. To provide context and a deeper understanding of how PFLs make decisions about their forestland, I approached those who had recently subdivided and sold forestland, gifted forestland, sold conservation easements, or had not yet committed to any plan in three counties and asked them to tell me about their experiences. \nI provide analysis on their planning processes and discuss themes derived from their experiences as they decide to subdivide and sell forestland, leave forestland to heirs, sell or donate conservation easements, or commit to none of these options. Study counties were categorized as being highly developed, moderately developed, or rural. Findings suggest PFLs\u2019 relationship and level of attachment to their land influenced their decision. Those who had not committed to any action and sold or donated easements expressed a strong attachment to their land. Conversely, PFLs who subdivided and sold forestland perceived the land as enabling and were less connected to it. In addition, family communication and relationships emerged as important factors in the planning process. PFLs expressed interest in giving land to heirs, particularly in the no action group. Lack of communication with heirs, strong connection to the land, and wariness of their economic future resulted in planning indecision among PFLs in the no action group. Lack of knowledge of planning alternatives among PFLs who subdivided and sold suggested that planning education and information would aid decision-makers. Easement holders perceived having greater control over their land through the easement, which was counter-intuitive. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2548], "author_name_tesi": "Gruver, Joshua Brion", "last_name_ssi": "Gruver", "middle_name_ssi": "Brion", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Craig Finley", "James Craig Finley", "Albert E Luloff", "Barbara Muth", "William F.

Recently, giant ECE was discovered in a series of dielectric materials, such as Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based polymers and ferroelectric ceramics. The ECE induced adiabatic temperature change in these materials can be higher than 10 K which makes them attractive because they provide the unique opportunity to explore and develop solid state cooling devices which are compact while providing high cooling power density and high efficiency compare to other cooling techniques, such as vapor compression refrigeration(VCR), thermoelectric, thermoacoustic, etc. A few ECE refrigerators have been studied in previous publications. However, the performance of those devices are still not so attractive. Besides, most of the existing works are based on simulation, and very few work has prototype demonstration.\n\nIn this thesis, two types of chip scale ECE based cooling devices with more advanced configurations have been proposed, studied, and experimentally demonstrated. One is named as ElectroCaloric Oscillatory Refrigerator (ECOR), which involves solid-state plates with anisotropic thermal conductivity as regenerators. The low thermal conductivity along the temperature gradient direction can reduce the heat conduction loss thus highly improve the performance of the device. Finite volume simulation shows that the temperature span (Tspan) of the refrigerator can be as large as around 50 K. The volumetric cooling power density Pc and coefficient of performance (COP) of the refrigerator was also studied. The maximum Pc can reach to 9.2 W/cm3, while the COP remains at 6.5, which is about 45% of the Carnot efficiency.\n\nA prototype of ECOR was experimentally demonstrated. The EC module with multilayer structure was fabricated with high energy electro irradiated poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) copolymer thin film. The regenerators with anisotropic thermal conductivity was realized by cutting thin slits in stainless steel plate and then refilled with epoxy. The testing results show that a maximum value of 6.6 K Tspan was obtained when the device was working at 1 Hz and with an electric field of 100 MV/m.\n\nThe second proposed device configuration is based on a rotary structure. This refrigerator involves no external regenerators. Instead, the regeneration process is realized by direct heat exchange between EC materials. The 1-D simulation results show that the Tspan of the device is nearly proportional to the number of segments in one ring (Ns), and the ECE induced adiabatic temperature change (Delta TECE). Owing to the absence of external regenerators, the Pc of this device can reach 33 W/cm3. Meanwhile, the COP of the device keeps above 8.5, which is about 60% of Carnot efficiency. 3-D finite element simulation validates the 1-D simulation results. A preliminary prototype was fabricated to demonstrate the proposed concept. About 0.8 K Tspan was obtained across the device when Delta TECE is 0.4 K.\n\nCompare with the existing ECE cooling devices, the ECOR device in this thesis involves solid state regenerator with anisotropic thermal conductivity which can highly reduce the conduction heat loss and thus improve the performance of the device. In the rotary cooling device, novel regeneration process is designed so that no external regenerators are required which also highly improve the cooling power density and efficiency of the device. The ideas of both solid state regenerator with anisotropic thermal conductivity, and the novel regeneration process are the main contributions of this thesis and will stimulate the development of high performance ECE cooling devices in the future.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9831], "author_name_tesi": "Gu, Haiming ", "last_name_ssi": "Gu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haiming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Zhiwen Liu", "Brent Craven"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Brent Craven, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrocaloric Effect", "Cooling Device", "Chip Cooling", "Chip refrigerator"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Model engineered cellulose-hemicelluose-pectin nanomaterials for understanding plant cell wall assembly", "id": "17696", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is a growing interest in the application of lignocelluloses in recent years. Apart from their traditional utilization for construction, paper production and combustion heating, lignocelluloses are being examined for next generation renewable biofuels and raw materials for new sustainable, engineered composites. The structure of lignocelluloses thus becomes an important subject essential for improved utilization and new application development. The plant cell wall is considered to be an ideal natural material exhibiting excellent mechanical properties. Wood such as Douglas-fir exhibits a Young\u2019s modulus of 13 GPa and ultimate strength (compression) of 50 MPa. A consequence of the molecular and nanoscale composition and organization responsible for this excellent behavior is a high degree of recalcitrance, which inhibits the efficient use of these materials for biofuel production. To better understand structure-property relationships, many recent studies have focused on modeling plant cell walls in vitro or in silico. A variety of plant cell wall models have been proposed, often representing differing conceptualizations of the wall architecture. To develop a better understanding of how various cell wall polymers interact and organize, model materials and systems are important to isolate specific behaviors key in cell wall assembly. Simpler model systems with fewer components and well defined constituents may also provide a much better experimental venue for connection to computational simulations, which may be difficult to apply to natural systems and their associated complexity and diversity. \nTo establish a more suitable system for studying cellulose-hemicellulose/pectin interactions and assembly, the selection of appropriate model cellulose materials was first explored. Specifically, model cellulose substrates representing the crystalline or highly ordered component as well as the amorphous or disordered component of natural cellulose were prepared using processes optimized not to alter the natural cellulose surface chemistry. \nCellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) were chosen to simulate the crystalline portion of natural cellulose. CNWs were produced using both sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid treatments. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, combustion gas analysis and N2 adsorption were used to quantify the degree of desulfation of H2SO4-prepared CNWs with or without desulfation. The results show that commercial cotton cellulose as received contained sulfur. Hydrochloric acid treatment did not result in any cellulose chemical modification. The sulfur content of H2SO4-prepared CNWs was higher than that exhibited by the original cellulose due to the esterification process. Hydrolysis using H2SO4 introduced sulfate groups onto the cellulose surface. Two desulfation methods, acid-catalyzed and solvolytic desulfation, were used in an attempt to remove the sulfate groups from H2SO4-prepared CNWs. However, they only resulted in partial desulfation of the cellulose nanowhiskers. The CNW surface esterification was estimated using a model of the cellulose structure in conjunction with both surface area measurements using N2 adsorption analysis, and a calculated surface area based on the measured dimensions of the CNWs produced. Calculations suggest that more than one third of the surface hydroxyls were substituted by sulfate groups.  Based on this analysis, HCl-prepared CNWs were chosen since they retained the most natural cellulose surface and should be used as an improved substrate to study cellulose-cell wall polysaccharide interactions.\nA model amorphous cellulose substrate was produced using CNWs as a starting material. It is produced by swelling, dissolution and regenerating CNW in high concentration of phosphoric acid (phosphoric acid swollen cellulose nanowhiskers, PASCNWs). This substrate was chosen to study cell wall polysaccharide assembly since its molecular weight remained the same as the starting material and no chemical modification of the cellulose was observed. \nTo understand the impact of different hemicellulose and pectin on cellulose assembly, four typical cell wall polysaccharides including xyloglucan, xylan, arabinogalactan and apple pectin (the majority of the polysaccharides is a homogalacturonan) were chosen. A novel cellulose producing system was used to mimic the cellulose synthesis component of cell wall formation. Specifically, the bacterium (Gluconacetobacter xylinus) strain ATCC 700178, which produces a spherical form of cellulose under agitated incubation, was grown in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) xyloglucan, xylan, arabinogalactan and pectin. Previous work has shown that the structure of the cellulose spheres consists of dense layers of cellulose which extend spherically from nearly the center of the sphere to the outer edge, making this a unique system for assessing the impact of hemicellulose/pectin addition on cellulose formation on scales which extend from elementary fibril formation on the molecular level (0.5-5 nm), to layer formation on the micro scale (1-25 \uf06dm), to overall sphere formation on the micro to macro level (100 \uf06dm to 5 mm).  Cellulose samples with xyloglucan and pectin had different macro structures compared to the other culture conditions. The micro structures showed that these two samples formed dense cellulose layers and had fewer cellulose fiber connections between layers.  Cellulose samples with xylan and xyloglucan were found to contain more I\u03b2 cellulose as found in higher plants, and exhibited decreased crystallinity and crystalline sizes according to X-ray diffraction patterns. IR spectroscopy confirmed the changes of crystal allomorph.\nTo further understand the role of xyloglucan and pectin in cellulose assembly, cellulose was also grown in cultures containing blends of both xyloglucan and pectin with different ratios. Results show that xyloglucan had the dominant impact on the assembly of cellulose, suggesting that xyloglucan and pectin may interact with cellulose at different points in the assembly process, or in different regions. This part of the study highlights that different hemicelluloses/pectins could affect cellulose assembly process in different steps of the synthesis process. \nTo understand the adsorption of cell wall polysaccharides to cellulose, highly ordered CNWs (representing the crystalline part of cellulose) and disordered PASCNWs (representing the amorphous part of cellulose) were used to understand the adsorption behaviors. Four cellulose substrates including CNWs from G. xylinus (cellulose I\u03b1 rich) or cotton (cellulose I\u03b2 dominant) and disordered PASCNWs derived from these two types CNWs with xyloglucan, xylan, arabinagalactan and pectin were used as model substrates. The binding behavior was characterized by adsorption isotherm and Langmuir models.  The maximum adsorption and the binding constant of xyloglucan, xylan and pectin to any CNWs were generally higher than to PASCNWs derived from the same source, suggesting that these polymers have a stronger affinity for an ordered cellulose surface. The binding affinity of xyloglucan, xylan and pectin to G. xylinus cellulose was always higher than to cotton cellulose, showing that binding interactions depended on the biological origin of cellulose and associated differences in its structure. The interaction energy was quantified when hemicellulose/pectin adsorbed to CNWs with isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. The exothermic interaction nature of cellulose-xyloglucan was confirmed. However, little interaction energy was observed when other hemicellulose was injected into cellulose suspensions. Further study revealed that the surface area, porosity and crystalline plane could all have impact on cellulose-hemicellulose/pectin interactions. \nFinally, to explore any correlation between the adsorption examined above and mechanical performance, model cell wall nanocomposites derived from G. xylinus cellulose or its CNWs were prepared. Xyloglucan and/or pectin were either added to static G. xylinus cultivations to obtain bacterial cellulose (BC) composite films, or blended to CNWs to obtain CNW composite films. The mechanical properties of the air-dried films were examined under extension conditions. The Young\u2019s modulus, strain and stress at break for the films were recorded. Results showed that the mechanical properties of CNW composites were similar to the pure CNW at low non-cellulosic polysaccharides concentration. With relatively high (60%) xyloglucan/pectin concentration, the modulus of the CNW composites was slightly reduced. However, if the xyloglucan and/or pectin were added to the bacterial cellulose culture, the BC composites became much less stiff and more brittle. The tensile tests together with morphological and crystal structure analysis indicate that surface coating or tethering of xyloglucan or pectin alone does not have significant impact on the mechanical properties of model cell wall materials. Xyloglucan and pectin could change the mechanical performance of model cell wall assembly during the cellulose synthesis process by either changing the cellulose bundling or cellulose network formation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7980], "author_name_tesi": "Gu, Jin ", "last_name_ssi": "Gu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Seong H Kim", "Teh Hui Kao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellulose", "hemicellulose", "pectin", "bacterial cellulose", "cellulose nanowhiskers"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF SELECTED SECURITY ISSUES IN WIRELESS NETWORKS\n", "id": "6645", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Wireless networks are becoming more and more important in our lives. However, due to the fact that wireless communication is on air, an\nadversary can easily eavesdrop on packets, imitate other wireless devices, forge packets, and so on. Hence, enhancing the security in wireless networks has become of vital importance. In this thesis, we mainly study two security aspects of wireless networks. One is\nservice confidentiality and access control, that is to ensure only legitimate users can access service data according to their privileges. The other is the prevention of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, that is to prevent injection of junk packets in wireless networks. To this end, we investigate the following two topics: key\nmanagement in wireless broadcast services and hop-by-hop source authentication in wireless ad hoc networks.\n\nWireless broadcast is a convenient and effective approach for disseminating data to a number of users. To provide secure access to broadcast data, key-based encryption ensures that only users who own valid keys can decrypt the data. Regarding various subscriptions in broadcast services, a key management system for distributing new keys efficiently and securely is in great demand. Hence, we propose a key management scheme, namely KTR, to address this need. KTR uses a shared key structure which exploits the overlapping relationships among different subscriptions and allows multiple programs to share a single key tree so that users who subscribe to these programs can manage less keys. KTR further reduces rekey cost by identifying the minimum number of keys that must be changed to ensure broadcast security.\n\nWireless ad hoc networks have very limited network resources and are thus susceptible to attacks that focus on resource exhaustion, such\nas the injection of junk packets. These attacks cause serious denial-of-service via wireless channel contention and network congestion. Although ad hoc network security has been extensively studied, most previous work focuses on secure routing and cannot prevent attackers from injecting a large number of junk data packets into a route that has been established. We propose an on-demand hop-by-hop source authentication protocol, namely SAF, to defend\nagainst this type of packet injection attacks. The protocol can either immediately filter out injected junk packets with very high probability or expose the true identity of an injector. Unlike other forwarding defenses, this protocol is designed to fit in the unreliable environment of ad hoc networks and incurs very lightweight overhead in communication and computation.\n\nIn summary, this study presents two security aspects of wireless networks. First, a key management scheme is proposed to address\nsecrecy and efficiency in broadcast services, where keys are used for service confidentiality and access control. The proposed approach performs better in terms of communication overhead, computation load and storage in mobile devices. Second, a hop-by-hop source authentication approach is proposed to prevent the packet injection attack, which is a type of denial of service attack based on resource exhaustion. This approach provides source authentication in the unreliable environment in ad hoc networks without interfering with the delivery of legitimate packets.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5042], "author_name_tesi": "Gu, Qijun ", "last_name_ssi": "Gu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qijun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu", "Peng Liu", "C Lee Giles", "Tracy Mullen", "Guohong Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Chair", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["key management", "denial of service", "ad hoc network", "wireless network", "security", "broadcast service"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Teachers' Attitudes Toward Parental Involvement in Selected Government Kindergartens in China", "id": "7034", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parental involvement can have very positive effects on student success, school and teachers\u00a1\u00af quality and program design.

While many western countries are making great progress in the theoretical and practical development in childhood education, research in this area in China is very limited. There is little research that has examined kindergarten teachers\u00a1\u00af attitudes toward parental involvement in childhood education. In order to address the new issue and to provide implications for the development of quality parental involvement, kindergarten teacher education programs and childhood education in China, this study was initiated to examine teachers\u00a1\u00af attitudes toward parental involvement in selected government kindergartens in China. A sample of 159 kindergarten teachers from 16 government kindergartens in Nanjing, China was selected in this study. The instrument employed in this study was a self-designed survey questionnaire which contained three parts: (1) demographic information, (2) teachers\u00a1\u00af attitudes toward school-based parental involvement, and (3) teachers\u00a1\u00af attitudes toward home-based parental involvement.

For indoor environments, LBS has a wide application for both civil and industrial areas. To make indoor LBS available, positioning technology has become a popular research topic in recent years. This dissertation investigates several indoor positioning topics based on visible light communication (VLC).\nFirst, it demonstrates the motivation to realize indoor LBS. Second, several positioning approaches are introduced to provide the location information. Positioning systems such as wireless local access network (WLAN), Zigbee, Bluetooth and radio frequency identification (RFID) are addressed. Third, fundamentals of VLC technology is detailed by explaining the light emitting diode (LED) as the transmitter, the photodiode (PD) as the receiver and the channel direct current (DC) gain considering the line-of-sight (LOS) condition. \nVisible light positioning systems are realized with lateration techniques based on received signal strength (RSS) information detected by PD. Two channel access methods are detailed and their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed. When height information of the receiver is unknown, three dimensional positioning is realized with an iterative algorithm based on the pre-estimation of the vertical coordinates. In order to further improve the positioning accuracy and alleviate the effect of large deviations, Kalman filter, particle filter as well as Gaussian mixture sigma point particle filter (GM-SPPF) are applied for both 2-D and 3-D scenarios. Considering the vertical accuracy cannot be improved largely from the filtering techniques, a nonlinear estimation algorithm is proposed based on a trust region algorithm.\nMultipath propagation is one of the most important factors that affects the performance of indoor positioning systems. In this dissertation, impulse response with multipath reflections are analyzed with the combined deterministic and modified Monte Carlo (CDMMC) algorithm. The received optical power from different LED bulbs and the positioning accuracy for the entire room is detailed. \nOrthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is also proposed in the positioning system, considering OFDM performs well when multipath reflections exist. Positioning performance is largely improved with OFDM compared to On-off-keying (OOK) modulation.

The pore space also provides much of the surface area accessible to solutes, colloids, or microorganisms in shale and consequently determines the fluid-rock interactions that occur in this important rock type. However, the pore structure of shale is still hard to evaluate using routine core analysis or petrophysical techniques because of the fine\u2013grained texture, presence of extremely small pore sizes with dimensions ranging over several orders of magnitudes (sub-nanometer to hundreds of micrometers), extremely low permeability, and complex organic-mineral associations. One technique that has proven useful in evaluating the porosity of shales is small-angle and ultra small-angle neutron scattering. These neutron scattering techniques can evaluate a wide range of pores with length scales from nanometers to micrometers in size. Additionally, neutron scattering data provides information on the fractal properties, pore orientation, pore volume, pore size distribution, specific surface area and fluid accessibility. In this dissertation, neutron scattering is used as the primary characterizing tool to probe the pore structures of shale. To use neutron scattering to investigate growth and development of pores in shale, both organic-rich and organic-poor shales are investigated under both weathered and unweathered conditions.\nTo use neutron scattering measurements to interpret shale porosity, a new data processing procedure and a new method for porosity calculation was developed to account for shale anisotropy. The degree of anisotropy of shale that affects neutron scattering depends on sample orientation: for most thin sections cut in the plane of bedding, the scattering pattern is isotropic, while for thin sections cut perpendicular to the bedding, the scattering pattern is anisotropic. Observations from focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) show that the anisotropic scattering patterns can be attributed to elongated pores predominantly associated with phyllosilicates. \nA combination of neutron scattering, FIB-SEM, and nitrogen adsorption measurements were used to characterize pore structures in samples from two boreholes of Marcellus shale, the spatially most extensive shale gas play in the United States. The distribution of pores in Marcellus shale comprises a random fractal over several orders of magnitude in spatial dimension (nanometer to tens of micron). Both porosity and specific surface area estimated through neutron scattering are in good agreement with the measurements by nitrogen adsorption. A novel approach was developed to characterize the structure of pores in organic matter (OM) in the shale. Additionally, water-accessible porosity determined by neutron scattering was distinguished from total porosity by exploiting contrast matching techniques. In contrast matching, the shale matrix is saturated with a suitable mixture of deuterated and protonated water, made to match the scattering length density of the shale. In addition, the porosity within the mineral matrix was distinguished from porosity in the OM by comparing neutron measurements on samples before and after combustion and removal of OM. \nIn the Marcellus, OM generally hosts 20\u221250% of the total porosity measured by neutron scattering. This porosity occupies as much as one third of the OM volume in some samples. OM pores in some samples are <2 nm in width and water-inaccessible. In contrast, sponge-like OM with pores >20 nm in width are dominant in some samples and these pores exhibit characteristics of water accessibility. This latter observation contradicts the current paradigm in the literature that OM porosity is organophilic and therefore not likely to host water.\nA combination of neutron scattering and SEM imaging was also used to investigate porosity formation during weathering of both organic-rich and organic-poor shales. To understand the controls on the evolution of weathering profiles that underlie hilly and mountainous regions, shale samples from boreholes and soil cores were collected from catchments located in Pennsylvania, USA (Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, SSHCZO), California, USA (Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, ERCZO), and Yilan, Taiwan (Fushan Experimental Forest, Fushan). The shale recovered from these three sites have similar mineralogical compositions, but are located in vastly different climate and tectonic settings. In particular, the erosion rate at Fushan (3-6 mm/yr) is much faster than at ERCZO (0.2-0.4 mm/yr) and SSHCZO (0.015 mm/yr); the average annual precipitation at Fushan is higher (3.4-4.3 m/yr vs. 1.7 m/yr at ERCZO and 1 m/yr at SSHCZO); and the mean annual air temperature at Fushan is higher (18 \u00b0C vs. 10 \u00b0C at ERCZO and SSHCZO). Regardless of the differences in erosion rate, the chemical weathering profiles at these three site are similar: pyrite and carbonate are depleted at depth; illite is not depleted in the consolidated rock material but is lost from the soil; the depletion profiles for chlorite and plagioclase initiate between the pyrite and illite fronts. At SSHCZO and ERCZO, the interface between weathered and unweathered rock roughly coincides with the zone of fluctuations in the water table and the samples above the water table have higher porosity and water-accessibility than the samples below. However, the mechanisms of porosity formation in shale chips are different at these three sites: most porosity was generated through chemical weathering (primarily chlorite dissolution) at SSHCZO; whereas, microfracturing dominated porosity generation at ERCZO and Fushan. It is possible that the eroding landscapes at each of the three sites are moving toward balance between rates of erosion and weathering advance. In the rapidly eroding Fushan and ERCZO sites, microfracturing may promote faster water infiltration and weathering advance rates relative to the more slowly eroding SSHCZO.\nWeathered Marcellus shale samples were collected from an outcrop at Frankstown, Pennsylvania, USA. The Marcellus shale formation in outcrop overlies a layer of carbonate (Onondaga Limestone) at ~ 10 m below land surface which is characterized by low porosity as measured by neutron scattering (<3%). All the shale samples above the carbonate layer are almost completely depleted in carbonate, plagioclase, chlorite and pyrite. The porosities in the weathered Marcellus shale are twice as high as in the unweathered samples from deep boreholes elsewhere in Pennsylvania. The pore size distribution exhibits a broad peak for pores of sizes in the range of tens of microns, likely due to the loss of OM and/or dissolution of carbonate during weathering. The weathering extent of silicates in the Marcellus shale has proceeded to a greater extent than in the organic-poor, Rose Hill shale collected in nearby SSHCZO. The greater weathering extent in the Marcellus shale despite the similarity in climate and erosion rate in these two neighboring locations is attributed to 1) the formation of micron-size pores as OM is oxidized that increase the infiltration rate and the extent of silicate weathering in weathered Marcellus shale; 2) the higher pyrite/carbonate ratio in the Marcellus shale as compared to the Rose Hill shale. The latter characteristic generates excess acidity as the pyrite oxidizes, enhancing the dissolution of the silicates.\nThe characterization approaches developed in this study provide quantitative descriptions of the size, roughness, distribution, and fluid accessibility of the complex pore structure of shale. The results from this study on pore size distribution and water-accessibility in both organic and mineral phases in Marcellus shale may facilitate more accurate models of gas transport and storage capacity and of water\u2212mineral interactions during hydrofracturing. The results from this study on shale weathering reveal the pathways of porosity formation as a function of tectonics, climate, and the mineral and OM content of the bedrock. These observations may ultimately yield better estimates of regolith depth and weathering rates on shale.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16151], "author_name_tesi": "Gu, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Gu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan L.

Sources of chemical contamination range from incorrectly disposing of and treating chemical waste, to abandoned waste disposal sites, to leaking storage tanks that might contain hazardous chemicals. Perchlorate is one of those contaminants that, due to kinetic and thermodynamic properties, is quite difficult to remove from contaminated waters and soils. Because of this, perchlorate has become a significant en-\nvironmental contaminants. Conventional treatment techniques, including virgin granular activated carbon (GAC), air stripping and advanced oxidation had limited or no effect on low perchlorate concentrations in water. Ion exchange with quaternary ammonium or pyridinium groups is currently the most frequently used method for the treatment of perchlorate-contaminated drinking water. This study aims to prepare activated carbon\ntailored with pyridinium functional groups to remove perchlorate from ground water.\n\nTo achieve this aim, three main phases of research activities were conducted. In Phase I, activated carbon with pyridinium functional groups and high pore volume was prepared. The sample preparation included three steps: nitric acid oxidation, thermal treatment in ammonia and the quaternization reaction. The surface chemistry and\npore structure of samples from each step were characterized (phase II) and the reaction conditions were optimized. In phase III, the final products were tested with respect to perchlorate adsorption (isotherm test and rapid small scale column test).\n\nThe nitric acid oxidation generated a large number of surface functional groups such as carbonyl, carboxyl, and phenol groups, which is a prerequisite for introducing a high amount of nitrogen containing moieties onto the carbon surface. During the second step of the treatment, amination, surface elemental analysis (by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS) results showed that nitrogen was incorporated into the carbon matrix as high as 7.2% (atomic percentage). The temperature of the ammonia treatment, the degree of pre-oxidation and the fraction of ammonia in the carrier gas influenced the resulting populations of oxygen and nitrogen species. Based on the XPS study on N1s spectrum at different amination temperature, it is suspected that during the initial stages of heating, some intermediates such as amide, lactam and imide were formed. As temperature increased, these labile species were converted to more thermodynamically stable structures with heterocyclic aromatic moieties (pyridinic or pyrrolic functional groups). At higher temperature (> 600&#9702;C), the fraction of quaternary nitrogen gradually increased and some nitrogen species might have decomposed. Through quaternization, pyridine groups at edge sites were successfully transformed to pyridinium groups (20%\nof total nitrogen). XPS in conjunction with chemical derivatization (by methyl iodide) was confirmed to be an effective way to qualitatively analyze the pyridinium species. Pyridinium-tailored carbon achieved as much as a 6-fold improvement in bed life for adsorbing perchlorate as determined by rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) using spiked groundwater with perchlorate (30 ppb).\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6640], "author_name_tesi": "Gu, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Gu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Nicole Robitaille Brown", "Fred Scott Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicole Robitaille Brown, Thesis Advisor", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Thesis Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["QUATERNIZED ACTIVATED CARBON", "PERCHLORATE REMOVAL"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Modulation of Obesity-Related Inflammation by Cocoa (Theobroma Cacao L. Sterculiaceae)", "id": "18760", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8927", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Obesity is associated with many metabolic diseases and it is now recognized as a state of chronic inflammation. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L. Sterculiaceae) is a rich source of polyphenols, in particular oligomeric flavan-3-ols (i.e. procyanidins) which have received considerable attention due to potential health beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory activities. However, the modulation of inflammatory and metabolic effects by cocoa has not been fully elucidated and there are still gaps and inconsistencies in the literature. In my thesis research, I hypothesize that dietary cocoa and cocoa procyanidins (CPs) can exert anti-inflammatory activity and modulate obesity-related pathologies via inhibition of digestive enzymes, suppression of cytokine and eicosanoid production, regulation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) target gene expression and modulation of metabolic endotoxemia. Results from this research would provide a comprehensive body of scientific evidence for the modulatory effects of cocoa on obesity-related inflammation, as well as mechanistic insights into the understanding of its in vivo anti-inflammatory actions. This research is significant to public health, and both the pharmaceutical and food industries.\nTo investigate this hypothesis, I first investigated the in vitro inhibitory activities of three cocoa extracts and isolated CPs with degree of polymerization (DP) of 2-10 against three purified digestive enzymes: pancreatic \u03b1-amylase (PA), pancreatic lipase (PL) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2). These enzymes, all of which play an important role in starch or lipid digestion, represent attractive targets for reducing macronutrient absorption and the prevention of obesity and its co-morbidities. CPs dose-dependently inhibited PA, PL, and PLA2, and the inhibitory potency increased as a function of DP (R2 > 0.93). Extract of Lavado cocoa, which is non-fermented and non-alkalized, was the most potent enzyme inhibitor among the three extracts (IC50 = 8.5- 47 \u00b5g/mL). The type of inhibition was characterized by kinetic analysis. Results suggest that regular cocoa extract, the CP pentamer (DP=5) and decamer (DP=10) inhibited PL activity in a mixed mode. The pentamer and decamer non-competitively inhibited PLA2 activity, whereas the regular cocoa extracts inhibited PLA2 competitively. This study demonstrates that cocoa rich in procyanidins can inhibit digestive enzymes in vitro, which may provide a safe and cost-effective approach for weight management and glycemic control.\nSecond, given the greater bioactive potential of CPs with higher DP and gaps in the literature regarding their anti-inflammatory activities, I examined the anti-inflammatory effects of high DP CPs on modulation of eicosanoid metabolism and cytokine production in vitro. Eicosanoids and pro-inflammatory cytokines are both important mediators in the establishment and maintenance of a state of obesity-related inflammation. In this study, a murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line stimulated by bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) was used as a model of inflammation. Results indicate that CPs mixture with DP \u2265 7 dose-dependently inhibited eicosanoid-generating enzymes (PLA2 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)) in vitro, and significantly decreased the production of their metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In addition, CP octamer suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In particular, CP octamer (100 \u03bcM) without cytotoxicity significantly decreased the production of IL-6 and MCP-1 by 97% and 70%, respectively in macrophages pre-challenged with LPS. These results suggest that high-DP CPs may counteract the effect of LPS and facilitate the resolution of inflammation. Together, this study demonstrated an anti-inflammatory role and potential therapeutic value of procyandin-rich cocoa in the diet of patients with inflammatory conditions.\nThird, based on the observed modulatory effects of cocoa on digestive enzymes and inflammatory markers in vitro, I designed studies to examine the effect of cocoa supplementation on markers of obesity-related inflammation in a mouse model. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a low-fat (LF, 10% kcal from fat) or a high-fat (HF, 60% kcal from fat) diet. After 8 wk, HF-fed mice were randomized into two groups: half were maintained on the HF diet and half were fed with a HF diet supplemented with 8% unsweetened cocoa powder (HF-HFC group) for 10 wk. At the end of wk 18, blood and tissue samples were collected for biochemical analyses. Results show that cocoa supplementation significantly reduced the rate of body weight gain (15.8%), and this was accompanied by increased fecal lipid content (55.2%) compared to HF-fed control mice. Further, it counteracted obesity-induced insulin resistance and fatty liver disease compared to the HF group. Cocoa supplementation also significantly decreased plasma levels of IL-6 (30.4%) and MCP-1 (25.2%), and increased adiponectin (33.7%) compared to HF-fed mice. Expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Il6, Il12b, Nos2 and Emr1) by adipose tissue macrophages was significantly reduced (37-56%) in the cocoa-supplemented mice. Therefore, in this animal study, I\u2019ve shown that short-term dietary supplementation with cocoa can ameliorate HF-induced body weight gain, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and fatty liver disease in mice. \nFinally, I conducted another mouse study to examine the effects and mechanisms of cocoa on adipose tissue (AT) inflammation through the alteration of eicosanoid metabolism, regulation of NF-\u03baB target gene expression, and modulation of metabolic endotoxemia in HF-fed mice. In HF-induced obesity, AT has a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism and produces a number of hormones and cytokines that predispose to the development of chronic inflammation. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a LF diet, a HF diet, and a HFC diet for 18 wk. Results demonstrate that cocoa supplementation significantly decreased pro-inflammatory gene expression (Tnfa, Il6, iNos and Emr1) in AT by 40-60% compared to the HF group, and this was accompanied by decreased protein expression of NF-\u03baB. AT arachidonic acid (AA) levels, an inflammatory eicosanoid precursor, were positively correlated with adiposity (r = 0.57) and cocoa-treated mice had 33% lower levels of AA compared to HF controls. Moreover, protein expression of the eicosanoid-generating enzymes adipose-specific PLA2 (AdPLA) and COX-2 were also reduced in cocoa-treated mice by 53% and 55%, respectively. Finally, plasma levels of endotoxin were found to be 40% lower than that of HF-fed mice. This decrease in metabolic endotoxemia was in parallel with increased a gut barrier function marker (glucagon-like peptide -2, GLP-2). Overall, this study has shown for the first time that long-term cocoa supplementation reduces AT inflammation in HF-fed mice by down-regulating NF-\u03baB target gene expression and modulating eicosanoid metabolism, which may be partly due to decreased metabolic endotoxemia by cocoa. \nIn conclusion, cocoa exerted anti-inflammatory activity and modulated obesity-related pathologies in vitro and in vivo. These effects appear to be mediated in part by inhibition of digestive enzymes and modulation of metabolic endotoxemia. As a result, moderate consumption of cocoa could be part of a healthy diet to prevent and treat obesity-related inflammation and resultant co-morbidities.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8767], "author_name_tesi": "Gu, Yeyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Gu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yeyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Ryan John Elias", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Sheila Grace West"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cocoa", "Theobroma Cacao", "procyanidin", "obesity", "inflammation", "metabolic syndrome"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Study of phase equilibria and defect chemistry of the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system from first-principles and computational thermodynamics towards photovoltaic applications", "id": "15028pxg928", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15028", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the photovoltaic materials Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) due to earth-abundancy and non-toxicity of its constituent elements. Its alloy with Se, Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe), has reached a conversion efficiency of 12.7%. Numerous experimental studies have revealed that the phase constitutions and defect chemistry have very important influences on the conversion efficiency. To further improve the performance, a thorough understanding of the phase equilibria and defect chemistry of the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system is therefore urgently needed.  \nIn this dissertation, the phase equilibria and defect chemistry of the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system are modeled using a methodology integrating the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method and first-principles calculations. The S-Se system is also modeled due to its important role in CZTSSe. The first-principles phonon calculations based on the quasi-harmonic approximation and the Debye model are used to obtain the Gibbs energies of the solid phases. The central quantities in defect chemistry, the formation energies of point defects, are calculated based on the supercell approach with proper finite-size corrections for charged defects. The data obtained from first-principles calculations are used to estimate the parameters in the CALPHAD model, and finally generate a self-consistent thermodynamic description of the studied system in agreement with available experimental data in the literature. Based on the thermodynamic model, the phase-defect diagrams of the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system are plotted, showing the phase equilibria and defect concentrations simultaneously under different conditions. It is observed that for reducing secondary phases and harmful point defects, (i) the composition should be towards ZnS-SnS2 side; (ii) the excess sulfur should not be in a large amount; (iii) the temperature and the pressure should not be too high or too low and optimal values exist.\nA large portion of effort in this dissertation is devoted to the methodology development, which can be divided into three categories: first-principles calculations, CALPHAD method, and their integration. For the first-principles calculations, the configuration-based estimation (CBE) method is developed to calculate the formation entropies of point defects efficiently, which avoids the time-consuming phonon calculations of the defected supercell with low symmetry. In addition, a hybrid method is developed to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the crystal with a large unit cell efficiently, where the acoustic phonons are approximated using a Debye-like model and the optical phonons are explicitly calculated in terms of vibrational frequencies. For the CALPHAD method, a physical model of thermal vacancies is proposed, which not only solves the long-standing controversy within the CALPHAD community, but also generates vapor-solid phase diagram in agreement with the experimental data. For the integration of the first-principles calculations and the CALPHAD method, a sublattice model that can treat perfect lattice sites, isolated point defects, point defect complexes and the charge carriers simultaneously is devised, with the model parameters being computable from the first-principles calculations. The above methodology development enables the modeling of complicated multi-component semiconductor systems, which is demonstrated in the Cu-Zn-Sn-S system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16399], "author_name_tesi": "Guan, Pinwen ", "last_name_ssi": "Guan", "first_name_ssi": "Pinwen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu", "Zi-Kui Liu", "Roman Engel-Herbert", "Ismaila Dabo", "John B.

In this work, electrochemical emission spectroscopy (EES) is used to identify corrosion mechanisms and to analyze the effect of pressure on corrosion reactions in high subcritical and supercritical aqueous systems.   \n\nTwo corrosion mechanisms, \u201cchemical oxidation\u201d (CO) and \u201celectrochemical oxidation\u201d (EO), have been proposed to describe the corrosion processes in high temperature aqueous systems, depending upon the density and dielectric constant of the systems.  EO corrosion processes are featured by partial charge transfer reactions such as the metal dissolution and the reduction of oxygen.  On the other hand, CO processes are dominated by direct molecular processes such as the direct reaction of the metal with aggressive species on one site.  EES method is used to differentiate two corrosion mechanisms by postulating that only the electrochemical mechanism gives rise to spontaneous fluctuations in current and potential.  Experiments show that the electrochemical mechanism is the dominant corrosion mechanism when the temperatures are below 350 oC and that it becomes of progressively lower importance as the temperature increases above the critical temperature (Tc = 374.15 oC).  The energy of activation of corrosion of Type 304 SS and titanium in 0.01 M HCl at the temperature range of 50 \u2013 250 oC has been estimated.  The result shows that titanium is more corrosion resistant than Type 304 SS in HCl solution due to the formation of the strong protective passive film on the surface of titanium.  \n\n\tA model is developed to study the effect of pressure on corrosion rates of metals in high temperature aqueous systems, with emphasis on contributions from the activation, the degree of dissociation of aggressive species, and the system isothermal compressibility.  EES was applied to estimate the pressure dependencies of the electrochemical corrosion rates of Type 304 SS and nickel in high temperature HCl solutions.  The study shows that the volume of activation of corrosion processes is pressure dependent in high temperature aqueous systems.  And the magnitude of the volume of activation decreases with increasing pressure in both high subcritical and supercritical conditions.  The contribution from the volume of activation plays a dominant role on the relative  dissociation is found to be more important to the relative corrosion rate at supercritical conditions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6664], "author_name_tesi": "Guan, Xueyong ", "last_name_ssi": "Guan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xueyong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Long Qing Chen", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Fan Bill B Cheung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supercritical water oxidation", "high subcritical and supercritical aqueous systems", "electrochemical noise analysis", "electrochemical corrosion mechanism", "chemical corrosion mechanism", "pressure", "volume of activation", "corrosion rates", "energy of activation of corrosion processes"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Reduced-dimensional Non-Gaussian Spatial Models and Statistical Methods for Studying the West Antarctic Ice Sheet", "id": "14397yig5031", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation research focuses on developing efficient statistical methods for high-dimensional non-Gaussian spatial data, and hierarchical models for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).

NMDA receptors are heterodimers made up of distinct, but different ion channel subunits.  The NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor contain the binding site for glutamate.  About half of vagal afferents express immunoreactivity for NMDA NR2B subunit and about half of the NR2B-expressing afferents also express NMDA NR2C or NR2D subunits. This suggests that increased meal size may be evoked by interference with glutamate binding to NMDA channels containing the NR2B subunit. To test this, we measured deprivation-induced intake of 15% sucrose solution following microinjection of Conantokin-G (NR2B blocker), D-CPPene (NR2B/2A blocker) and PPDA (NR2D/C blocker) directly into the NTS.   Conantokin (10ng/100nl), D-CPPene (10ng/100nl) and PPDA (1ng/100nl) increased 60-min sucrose intake significantly compared to control (Conantokin: 14.2 \u00b1 0.3 ml vs 16.57ml \u00b1 0.3) (D-CPPene: 11.8 \u00b1 0.3ml vs 14.6 \u00b1 0.3ml) (PPDA: 13.7 \u00b1 0.2ml vs 16.3 \u00b1 0.4ml). These results show that NTS NMDA receptor subunits NR2A/B as well as NR2D/C participate in control of meal size. NMDA receptors participate in control of food intake via vagal efferent neurons that innervate the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract.   Over 80% of vagal afferents that inervate the upper GI tract express imunoreactivity for NR2B and NR1 receptor subunits.  Thus, glutamate receptors located at the peripheral vagal afferent endings may also influence food intake. To further assess peripheral NR2 receptor subunit participation in the control of food intake, we measured intake of regular food (rat chow), palatable nutrient (15% sucrose), and non-nutrient (0.2% saccharin) solutions following various doses of intraperitoneal administration of D-CPPene (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mg/kg). D-CPPene (2.0, 3.0 mg/kg) increased significantly 60min sucrose but not saccharin intake. It also increased 30-min chow intake at 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg dose.  To test whether D-CPPene increases feeding by interfering with postoral satiation signals such as CCK, we examined the effect of systemic (IP) administration of D-CPPene on suppression of food intake by CCK. Pretreatment with D-CPPene (2 mg/kg) completely reversed the inhibitory action of CCK and increased intake above saline, control level. Finally, to dissect the contribution of CCK in D-CPPene-sensitive vagal sensory signaling pathways, we complemented the behavioral tests with an anatomical approach that uses neuronal Fos expression in the dorsal vagal complex after stimulation by exogenous administration of CCK. Blockade of NR2B/A subunit resulted in a significant attenuation in CCK-induced Fos expression in the dorsal hindbrain (-14.08  and -13.80 from bregma).  In summary, these results show that: 1) selective NMDA receptor antagonist with specificity for NR2B, NR2C and NR2D subunits applied directly to the hindbrain increase food intake; 2) systemic blockade of NMDA receptor containing NR2B/A subunits increase food intake and attenuates inhibition of food intake and Fos expression by CCK. This provides evidence that NR2 receptors subunits located on central vagal afferent terminals participate in control of food intake. They also suggest that peripheral NMDA receptors expressing the NR2B/A phenotype are involved in modulation of inhibition of food intake by gastrointestinal signals and opens the possibility of a peripheral site of action of NMDA receptors\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1326], "author_name_tesi": "Guard, Douglas Brent", "last_name_ssi": "Guard", "middle_name_ssi": "Brent", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mihai Covasa", "Michael Henry Green", "Andras Hajnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mihai Covasa, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Henry Green, Thesis Advisor", "Andras Hajnal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["NMDA receptors", "NR2 subunit", "ingestive behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EXAMINING THE INFLUENCE OF SHARED MENTAL MODELS AND TRANSACTIVE MEMORY SYSTEMS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT TEAMS\n\n", "id": "12231", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4967", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study examined the combined influence of two types of team cognitions (shared mental models and transactive memory systems) on team adaptability, team performance, and team member satisfaction.

The NLS in MA overlaps the plasma membrane-targeting signal (M) and the NLS in NC coincides with the vRNA binding, or interaction (I) domain.  Because the same sequences are used for multiple functions, it is likely that different host and viral factors interact with these motifs in Gag to regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport, membrane-binding, and particle assembly.  \n\tThe host import factors for the mature MA/NC proteins, transportin SR, importin 11 and importin \u00e1/\u00e2, and the export receptor for p10, CRM1, were identified using a genetic screen in yeast 64.  Through my studies, we found that Gag directly associates with importin 11 and importin \u00e1/\u00e2 in host cells and in vitro.   Association of these importins with Gag is specifically competed by vRNA binding, indicating that Gag does not bind vRNA and import factors simultaneously.  In contrast, direct binding of Gag to the CRM1-RanGTP nuclear export complex was stimulated by vRNA.  These results suggest that vRNA interactions serve as a switch to regulate the association of Gag with host proteins that mediate nuclear trafficking and genomic-RNA packaging.  \nDetailed biochemical and biophysical analysis of the Gag:importin \u00e1 complex revealed a 1:1 stoichiometry; however, previous studies show Gag oligomerizes in the nucleus 218, suggesting oligomerization first occurs after nuclear entry when Gag interacts with its vRNA.  I became interested in how the Gag monomer that enters the nucleus associates with vRNA, multimerizes, and eventually forms the complete immature virus particle at the plasma membrane. \n\tInitially, I showed that Gag, which appeared to be mostly monomeric in solution, underwent a conformational change when bound to \u00b5\u00f8RNA, the minimal vRNA packaging signal, leading to the cooperative formation of Gag dimers, tetramers and hexamers.  These 6Gag:1vRNA units bound to other Gag hexamers, forming stable trimers and heptamers of hexamers.  Estimatation of the binding affinities of Gag to \u00f8-containing vRNAs revealed picomolar affinities, while other oligonucleotides, including a mutant-vRNA that alters the structure of the packaging signal, bound with nanomolar affinities.  These studies suggest very tight, specific binding to the vRNA, with the high affinity interaction primarily due to the structure of the RNA packaging signal (\u00f8).  \nAlthough these early assembly intermediates were formed using the Gag protein and vRNA, it appeared that complete virus particles could not form spontaneously at neutral pH.  Because complete particles form at the plasma membrane in cells, we hypothesized that membrane lipids, specifically inositol phosphotidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), previously implicated in membrane targeting of other retrovirus Gag proteins 68,76,178,329,374, may trigger complete particle formation from early assembly intermediates.  \nI found that the addition of PI(4,5)P2 to preassembled Gag:vRNA complexes led to the formation of tubular structures, suggesting these inositol phosphates interact with Gag:vRNA complexes to promote polymerization.  Characterization of the binding affinity of RSV Gag and MA proteins to PI(4,5)P2 showed that MA/Gag bound PI(4,5)P2 with high affinity, triggering a conformational change in MA/Gag, with implications in oligomerization.  PI(4,5)P2 also competed with importin 11 for Gag/MA binding, suggesting PI(4,5)P2 may be involved in the regulation of both nuclear and plasma membrane trafficking of Gag.  Examination of Gag:PI(4,5)P2 interactions in cells implicated this inositol phosphate in membrane targeting and budding of Gag during the virus life cycle.  Thus, these data suggest that RSV Gag associates with PI(4,5)P2 during infection to regulate both  subcellular trafficking and particle assembly.\nBased on my studies, I formulated a model of early retroviral particle assembly.  I propose, after synthesis, Gag binds to importin 11 and/or importin \u00e1/\u00e2 as a monomer.  Once in the nucleus, Gag binds to the vRNA, inducing a conformational change in the Gag protein which not only increases its affinity for CRM1 but also nucleates Gag oligomerization.  This assembly competent Gag:vRNA complex is exported from the nucleus, forming a hexameric lattice of Gag proteins enroute to the plasma membrane.  At the membrane, this Gag:vRNA complex will interact tightly with PI(4,5)P2, resulting in another conformational change that induces oligomerization of Gag:vRNA complexes with other Gag  proteins, culminating in complete particle production.  These studies not only answer many questions regarding retroviral assembly and Gag subcellular trafficking, but provide novel methods to study assembly in the future.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4699], "author_name_tesi": "Gudleski, Nicole ", "last_name_ssi": "Gudleski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent", "Leslie Joan Parent", "John Michael Flanagan Jr.", "Richard James Courtney", "Jianming Hu", "Rebecca C Craven", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent, Dissertation Advisor", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Chair", "John Michael Flanagan Jr., Committee Member", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["subcellular trafficking", "assembly", "Retrovirus", "Gag polyprotein"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF TWO DISTINCT dGCN5-CONTAINING HAT COMPLEXES IN DROSOPHILA\n", "id": "6696", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5476", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Eukaryotes organize their genomes in the form of chromatin, a filament composed of DNA, histones and non-histone proteins. Chromatin structure plays crucial roles in the regulation of nuclear processes that employ DNA as template, including transcription, DNA replication, repair and recombination. Chromatin structure can be altered to allow such processes to occur in the cell. One way to do so is by covalently modifying different amino acid residues present at the histone N-terminal tails, which protrude away from the nucleosomes. These modifications can affect inter-nucleosomal interactions and result in changes in the compaction of chromatin. In addition, covalently modified histone tails can recruit additional factors which can trigger downstream events. \nAcetylation is one of the best characterized histone modifications. This modification is performed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which transfer an acetyl group from acetyl CoA to lysine residues of the histone tails. This modification is reversible and can be removed by histone deacetylases. The yeast coactivator SAGA provides a good example of a HAT and has been studied in detail. Different experiments demonstrated that histone acetylation by the SAGA complex is required for transcription of a subset of genes. Gcn5 is the catalytic subunit of this complex and is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes. \nAt the time we began this project, the dGcn5 (Drosophila Gcn5) gene had been cloned but no additional information was available about dGcn5. Therefore, we sought to determine if dGcn5 forms part of multi-subunit protein complexes in flies, which would enable us to understand the role of dGcn5 in fly development. This thesis describes the purification of dGcn5 as part of two distinct HAT complexes. One of these complexes is dSAGA (Drosophila SAGA), which shares homologous subunits with yeast SAGA and the mammalian complexes STAGA, PCAF and TFTC. We identified a novel WD-repeat containing protein in dSAGA and demonstrated that this protein is essential for viability and required for histone H3 acetylation in the embryo. The other dGcn5-containing complex we purified, ATAC (Ada Two A Containing), harbors an orthologue of the human VP16-interacting protein HCF-1, as well as other uncharacterized proteins with conserved domains. ATAC is very different from SAGA, both in size and biochemical composition, which suggests that ATAC and dSAGA carry out distinct functions during Drosophila development\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5468], "author_name_tesi": "Guelman, Sebastian ", "last_name_ssi": "Guelman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sebastian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry L Workman", "Susan M.

Few research studies have focused on novice learners\u2019 skill acquisition of a complex task without practice.  The purpose of this experimental study was to examine maximum efficiency of skill learning without practice using Observation Learning (OL), Forced-Choice Learning (FCL), and Goal-Shaped Learning (GSL) on the performance of novice instrumental music learners.  \n\nUndergraduate non-music majors with no previous experience in string instrumental music participated in this study (N=57).  All participants completed a pre-test and post-test during which they were asked to perform the first phrase (first 13 notes) of the common folk song \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb.\u201d  During the treatment, the OL participants viewed the researcher performing the task in pairs of videos with good and poor performances.  The FCL participants viewed the same pairs of videos and were asked to choose which of the videos in each pair seemed better to them.  The GSL participants observed the same pairs of videos, made forced-choice decisions about which video in each pair seemed better to them, and received the expert feedback in the form of agreement or disagreement with the experts. \n\nParticipants\u2019 pre- and post-test performances were sent to experts who provided Likert ratings in five component areas: posture, left hand technique, right hand technique, rhythmic accuracy and tonal accuracy.  Statistically significant results (p<.05) indicated that participants in the OL and GSL groups increased their posture scores following the treatment.  Interestingly, participants in the FCL group had lower post-test ratings in all five measured areas, although only the area of posture was statistically significant.  An important practical finding for this study is that novice learners may be able to learn complex tasks without practice when correct information is presented and they are sufficiently engaged in the learning process.  GSL may be an effective method for efficient learning and its use in music learning should be researched further.  Additional research studies could explore skill learning without practice, GSL in other learning areas, or examine forced-choice and Likert Scale ratings as tools for assessment.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1800], "author_name_tesi": "Guerriero, Elizabeth  M.", "last_name_ssi": "Guerriero", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Music Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Dale Gardner", "Linda Carol Porter Thornton", "Robert Dale Gardner", "David A.

In structural health monitoring (SHM) applications (aircraft, bridges, etc.), real time data can be used to improve safety and reduce maintenance costs.  In other applications (such as carbon-carbon production and ceramic sintering) in-situ ultrasonic measurements can be used to study how a material is affected by different manufacturing conditions.  Ultrasonic measurements can also be used in place of convention temperature, pressure, fluid flow, or level sensors.\n\tThe work presented in this dissertation focused on studying an ultrasonic guided waves based system for performing in-situ measurements on specimens which are commonly used in the accelerated life tests conducted in materials and test reactors (MTRs).  Using this system, ultrasonic waves could be sent down a thirty foot long waveguide to a specimen while locating the transducer outside of the hostile environment.  Both the theoretical and experimental results demonstrated how individual components of the system influenced the monitoring capabilities.  \n\tAs one example, the in-situ monitoring system was studied for use in measuring the change in length of creep specimens.  Successful measurements of creep elongation were demonstrated using a pulse-echo configuration of the in-situ monitoring system.  In addition, the temperature dependence of the in-situ creep measurement was also studied.  Both theoretical calculations and experiments showed that the temperature dependence of group velocity was approximately linear for the creep specimen geometry.\n     \u2018Blister\u2019 specimens having a rectangular cross-section were also considered in this work.  Theoretically driven semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) calculations, time-domain finite element calculations, and experimental measurements were performed to investigate guided wave propagation in this specimen.  The SAFE calculations, finite element predictions, and experimental results all demonstrated good agreement.  In general, the guided wave mode with the fastest group velocity appeared to be the most prominent in both the simulated and experimentally measured waveforms.  Several types of defects were considered.  Defects can sometimes produce temperature anomalies in the specimen.  The models indicated that detection of a defect induced temperature gradient in the rectangular \u2018blister\u2019 specimen was possible.  \n    In the design and operation of an in-situ monitoring system based on guided ultrasonic waves, the transducer design plays an important roll in the performance of the system.  In this work, a magnetostrictive sleeve design was tested as an alternative to a wire-wire joint configuration.  Results showed that the sleeve design was effective for generating ultrasonic guided waves in the wire waveguide.  In addition, the sleeve design simplifies specimen fabrication, minimizes the amount of magnetostrictive material required, and eliminates the artifacts associated with the wire-wire joint.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4141], "author_name_tesi": "Guers, Manton John", "last_name_ssi": "Guers", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Manton", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Chair", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["structural health monitoring", "remote monitoring", "ultrasonic guided wave"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Mapping the Liminal Identities of Mulattas in African, African American, and Caribbean Literatures\n", "id": "7397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3580", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\n\n\tIn twentieth-century African, African American, and Caribbean literatures, mixed-blood women are often misread as figures frozen in tragic postures. Such unrealistic portraitures replicate the traditional white-authored pathologizations of racial hybridity. Drawing on the theoretical framework of liminality, this study investigates how mulattas negotiate their identities in specific socio-cultural environments, times, and places. Four writers of African descent and dissimilar socio-historical backgrounds are studied: Abdoulaye Sadji from Senegal, Bessie Head from South Africa, Mayotte Cap\u00e9cia from Martinique, and Nella Larsen from the United States. \n\tThe study is divided into five chapters that deal with the experiences of mulattas in autobiographical writing, sexuality, madness, racial passing, and expatriation. Thematic and stylistic discrepancies in the works examined are ancillary to the common liminal strategies of de-marginalization and self-reconstruction of female heroines. Their attempts at self-assertion appear in the ways in which they resist the constrictions of patriarchal and racist regimes. Their construction of spaces of agency is interwoven with ambiguity, ambivalence, and contradictions, which are emblematic of the discontinuities of their lives and paradigmatic of their intricate search for identity. In the works, the liminal experiences of mulattas are framed within the quests for social visibility, the affirmation of humanity, the renegotiation of space, and the anomic straddling between oppositional boundaries and statuses. Through their striving to rise above the limitations imposed on their gender and race, mulattas commit acts of transgression and dissemblance, and disrupt racial taxonomy. I demonstrate that liminality is a major unifying thread that runs through all the narratives and argue that it creates alternative existential paradigms for mixed-blood women. Liminality is an appropriate tool that challenges monolithic views of identities through the re-articulation of cultural meanings. \n\tMy main contribution is twofold. First, I extend the traditional cartography of liminality, which is usually based on small-scale societies where individuals have loyalty to their primary communities. Second, I suggest new vistas for race criticism in diasporic studies.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3560], "author_name_tesi": "Gueye, Khadidiatou ", "last_name_ssi": "Gueye", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Khadidiatou", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Albert Hale", "Iyunolu Folayan Osagie", "Pius Adesanmi", "Christiane Jocelyne Makward", "Bernard W Bell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Albert Hale, Committee Chair", "Iyunolu Folayan Osagie, Committee Member", "Pius Adesanmi, Committee Member", "Christiane Jocelyne Makward, Committee Member", "Bernard W Bell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ambivalence and ambiguity", "liminal identities"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CHEMICALLY-DRIVEN TRANSPORT OF COLLOIDAL PARTICLES AND MOLECULES ", "id": "14304rxg276", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chemically-driven transports are ubiquitous in nature and govern the working principles of several biochemical processes. Understading the mechanisms involved in such transport processes would enable us to answer and potentially solve many problems in separation, diagnostics, energy, electronics and communications. In this dissertation, I primarily addressed chemically-driven transports which arise from artificial and natural concentration gradients.  The two major chemically-driven transports discussed in this dissertation are electrokinetic transport and molecular chemotaxis. Diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis are electrokinetic flows of colloidal particles and fluids respectively, which result from interaction of ionic concentration gradients with charged surfaces. Molecular chemotaxis, on the other hand, is solely driven by chemical potential gradients and dictated by the binding affinity between two molecules. \nHigh pressure reverse osmosis membrane separation peocesses are limited by fouling phenomena which limit the process efficiency and result in frequent shutdowns. This problem was addressed first by identifying diffusiophoresis as one of the leading mechnaisms of colloidal fouling in reverse osmosis systems and then a scalable solution was proposed by modifying the membrane surface with catalytic activity. Diffusiophoresis and diffusioosmosis mechanisms were also found to exist in an evaporating droplet with salt and colloidal particles, which result in spatio-temporal modulation of deposited patterns. These electrokinetic mechasims associated with droplet evaporation were successfully used to develop novel particle separation, cancer diagnosis and energy efficient solar cell fabrication. Finally, molecular chemotaxis mechanism of dyes in concentration gradients of neutral polymers was investigated. It was found that hydropobic attraction and charge-dipole interaction between dye and polymer molecules were active mechanism responsible for chemotaxis in microfluidics and dialysis systems. Understanding this phenomenon would enable us to develop novel molecular separation techniques and to build programmable devises implementing chemotactic logic gates.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15461], "author_name_tesi": "Guha, Rajarshi ", "last_name_ssi": "Guha", "first_name_ssi": "Rajarshi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol", "Darrell Velegol", "Manish Kumar", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Chair", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemically-driven transport", "Diffusiophoresis", "Diffusioosmosis", "Reverse Osmosis", "Membrane fouling", "Catalytic Membrane", "Metal oxide nanoparticles", "Coffee ring", "Surface patterning", "Dye-sensitized solar cells", "Methylated DNA detection", "Molecular chemotaxis", "Binding-unbinding", "Molecular dyes", "polymer gradients", "microchannel", "COMSOL modeling", "Droplet evaporation modeling", "Coffee ring number", "Polystyrene particles", "Chemotaxis index"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Differentially Private Convex Optimization For Empirical Risk Minimization And High-dimensional Regression", "id": "16390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Learning systems are the backbone of most web-scale advertisement and recommendation systems. Such systems rely on past inputs from users to decide on a particular advertisement or recommendation to be displayed to a new user. The way these learning systems work is by first recording past user responses (collectively called the \\emph{training} data) and then learning a prediction model which decides on a relevant advertisement or recommendation for a new user. Often the training data sets contain sensitive information about users (e.g., sexual orientation or marital status). Recent research has shown that these large-scale learning systems can inadvertently leak sensitive information about individual users in the training data \\cite{Korolova10,CalandrinoKNFS11}. This leads us to think about designing learning algorithms which do not leak ``too much'' information about any individual (user) in the training data.\n\nIn this dissertation we design learning algorithms with rigorous privacy guarantees. We adhere to a formal well-accepted notion of privacy, called  \\emph{differential privacy} \\cite{DMNS06}. Differential privacy  guarantees that an algorithm's output does not depend too much on the data of any individual in the data set. This is crucial in fields that handle sensitive data, such as genomics, collaborative filtering, and economics.\n\nIn our work we design differentially private algorithms for the following two sets of learning problems: i) convex optimization for empirical risk minimization (the most common use of convex optimization in machine learning), and ii) sparse regression (a broad class of high-dimensional problems). For both these problems, we design differentially private algorithms that are provably (almost) as accurate as the best non-private algorithm.

The thermal stabilities of the feedstocks and the blends were tested in the oxidative and pyrolytic regimes using microautoclave or tubing bomb reactors. Some properties, such as density, net heat of combustion, smoke point, flash point, viscosity and freezing point were also evaluated. The coal-based fuel JP-900 was produced at Intertek-PARC in Harmarville, PA, by hydrotreating and hydrogenating a blend of RCO (refined chemical oil), and LCO (light cycle oil) at 1:1 ratio by weight. \nFor a fuel to be utilized in a jet engine, the fuel has to be thermally stable and also meet all the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) requirements.  All the properties evaluated were done following an ASTM standard. The study has shown that JP-900 meets the specification requirement for flash point and freezing point. But, the problem associated with high cycloalkane content in JP-900 is high density and low hydrogen content. Due to the high content of cyclic compounds in the coal-based fuel, JP-900 was blended with two models paraffinic fuels dodecane and Norpar-13 to evaluate the properties of the blends. The results from this blending are that some properties, such as density, hydrogen content and net heat of combustion, were improved. But, for the freezing point the blending did not improve the properties, because the paraffinic fuels had very high freezing points. The boiling point distribution of the samples was also evaluated under the ASTM D 2887. Models proposed in the literature were also tested on some properties such as flash point, freezing point and smoke point. The correlation proposed by Wickey and Chittenden predicted the flash point of the JP-900/Norpar-13  blend with an average absolute error of 1.8oC and 1.5oC for the JP-900/dodecane mixture. For the viscosity, the model from Moharam et al. accurately predicted the kinematic viscosity of the feedstock and all the blends with an average absolute error of 0.35 cSt. Except for the coal-based fuel JP-900, the Cookson et al. model accurately predicts the freeze point temperatures of the blends and the paraffinic fuels, with an average absolute error, predicted versus observed, of 1.95oC for JP-900/Norpar-13 and 3.2\u00baC for the JP-900/dodecane blend. For the sooting tendency, the model from Cookson et al. predicted accurately the smoke point of the coal-based fuel and two blends B101 and B201 with an absolute error of 1mm. \nChemical compositions and structures of coal-based jet fuel were determined by GC/MS, 13C NMR and 1H NMR analyses. Quantitative analysis by GC/MS was used to classify chemical composition into seven groups of compounds, while NMR analysis was used to identify the aliphatic and aromatic regions of interest in this work. The results from GC/MS and NMR characterization showed significant agreement in terms of presence or non-appearance of aromatics in the fuels. \nThe thermal stressing of the coal-based and paraffinic fuels, along with their blends, was conducted in the oxidative and the pyrolytic regimes using a 25 mL microautoclave reactor. In the oxidative regime 5 mL of sample fuels was heated at 200oC in the presence of air. The pyrolytic stability was determined by heating 5 mL of sample at 450oC under 100 psig of ultra-high purity N2 for different periods of time. The results from these stressing showed that JP-900 was thermally stable at both temperatures, 200oC and at 450oC for a period of 4h. The extents of fuel degradation in terms of liquid depletion and gas formation in the pyrolytic regime were higher with the paraffinic fuels than with the coal-based fuel. In the oxidative regime the addition of paraffinic fuels to JP-900 did not show any significant difference in the results, but in the pyrolytic regime, blending dodecane or Norpar-13 into JP-900 decreased the thermal stability of the blends.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5819], "author_name_tesi": "Guiadem, Sidonie ", "last_name_ssi": "Guiadem", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sidonie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Harold Harris Schobert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Thesis Advisor", "Harold Harris Schobert, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal stability", "Jet fuel properties", "coal  liquefaction", "fuel characterization"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Where cartography meets typography: choosing typefaces and semantic effects for maps using microaesthetics", "id": "ht24wj40p", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Maps are a multilayered semiotic system, and labels comprise an important part of\nthis system.

On a branded map, typeface personality can influence the connotation\nof the map, and thus that of the brand or national mapping organization. Choosing type for\nmaps requires careful attention to the characteristics of type that produce its personality. Past\napproaches to quantifying typeface characteristics have conflated aesthetic properties of\ntypeface form, called microaesthetics, with meta-properties of labels such as color and case.\nThis conflation has resulted in guidelines that fail to address issues of typographic aesthetics\nin a meaningful and applicable way. This problem was addressed in a twofold manner. First,\ntypographic visual variables were redefined as label properties, separate from\nmicroaesthetics. Second, a framework of salient microaesthetics and their associated\npersonalities was created in a multi-step research process. 36 typefaces were selected from an\ninformal poll of cartographic designers. In a web survey, graphic designers were shown the\ntypefaces on maps and asked to rank them on eight personalities. The microaesthetics of\nselected letterform elements were tabulated and analyzed through categorical PCA and duality\ndiagram analysis to determine which microaesthetics were strongly associated with the terms\ntested in the survey. Strongly associated microaesthetics and effects were added to the\nframework. This framework allows the cartographer to evaluate the aesthetic aspects of type,\nand to accept or reject a typeface under consideration. Such a framework could help guide\ncartographers to better express semantic goals in a designed map.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12333], "author_name_tesi": "Guidero, Elaine Meredith", "last_name_ssi": "Guidero", "middle_name_ssi": "Meredith", "first_name_ssi": "Elaine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Deryck William Holdsworth", "Anthony C Robinson", "Sarah K Rich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer, Dissertation Advisor", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Committee Chair", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member", "Anthony C Robinson, Committee Member", "Sarah K Rich, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cartography", "typography", "cartographic design", "microaesthetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "HYDROGEN BONDED POLYMER BLENDS", "id": "5905", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis discusses three topics in the general area of hydrogen bonded polymer blends. The first pertains to the blending of flame retardant polyphosphazenes. Poly[bis(n-alkyoxy)phosphazenes] blends with poly(butyl methacrylate-co-4-vinyl phenol) (BMAVPh) were initially studied.  These results were compared to BMAVPh blends of analogous poly (vinyl n-alkyl ethers) and the phase behavior was similar. Next, poly[bis(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene] blends with a structural polyurethane foam were prepared via reactive mixing.  The combustion behavior of these foams was analyzed qualitatively, by a horizontal flame test, and quantitatively, by oxygen index (OI) measurements. Both of these tests indicated a modest increase in flame resistance at loadings of 20 wt% and above.  In the second topic, equilibrium constants determined from low molecular weight mixtures were used to successfully predict the phase behavior of analogous polymer blends. Due consideration was given to intramolecular screening and functional group accessibility, factors that are a direct consequence of chain connectivity.  In the third topic, polymer blends involving an alternating 1:1 copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and a hexafluoroisopropanol modified vinyl ether (HFIPVE) were studied. This copolymer is interesting for both experimental and theoretical studies of the phase behavior of polymer blends because (1) it is amorphous and has a relatively low glass transition temperature (12\u00b0C); (2) it has a relatively low solubility parameter (? 7 (cal.cm-3)-0.5); (3) it is soluble in moderately polar solvents, and (4) it contains the hexafluoroisopropanol group that is a strong hydrogen bond donor. Experimental infrared and thermal analysis studies of polymer blends with (co)polymers containing acetoxy, methacrylate and aliphatic ether groups were studied and compared to theoretical predictions of miscibility maps.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3538], "author_name_tesi": "Guigley, Kevin Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Guigley", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Raymond Howell", "Michael M Coleman", "Tze Chiang Chung", "Paul C Painter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Michael M Coleman, Committee Chair", "Tze Chiang Chung, Committee Member", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen bonding", "Polymer", "phophazene"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Twilight of our years: Text, identity, and reader subjectivity\n", "id": "11980", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3164", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "What attracts us to the books we read, and why? Do our attractions, and the enjoyment that stems from such attractions, give clues as to who we are? This dissertation is an exploration of those questions. I conducted a case study analysis of discussions that occurred between two groups of readers, one group comprised of adults in graduate school and one group comprised of adolescents in high school, on the Twilight series of books. I employ critical discourse analysis, psychoanalytic, and reader response theories to uncover how both groups of readers use the texts in the formation of their identities. Through reading group discussions, journal writing, and textual analysis, I explore how the readers resist, accommodate, and question subjectivity and identity within the text and outside of the text. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3151], "author_name_tesi": "Guillard, Julianne ", "last_name_ssi": "Guillard", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Julianne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gail Louise Boldt", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere", "Dana Lynn Mitra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gail Louise Boldt, Dissertation Advisor", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Committee Chair", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["feminist", "girlhood", "critical discourse analysis", "psychoanalytic theory", "reader response theory", "Twilight", "reading", "identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "HOW IMMUNOLOGICAL STUDIES ARE BEING INFLUENCED BY HELICOBACTER HEPATICUS STATUS IN THE MOUSE COLONIES \n\n", "id": "9588", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3166", "abstract_tesi": "Contamination with Helicobacter hepaticus is very common in research mouse colonies yet little is known about how this persistent infection affects immunological research conducted in infected mice. The goal of this study was to determine if herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1)-specific immune responses and the characteristics of dendritic cells (DCs) can be altered by the H. hepaticus infection status of mouse colonies. We measured and compared virus-specific antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses in H. hepaticus-infected and non-infected mice that were inoculated intranasally with HSV-1. The effect of H. hepaticus on the HSV-1-specific antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses in superficial cervical and tracheobronchal lymph nodes (LNs) did not reach the level of statistical significance. In separate experiments, we compared the expression of maturation-associated surface markers CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC II and proinflammatory cytokines IL-12p40 and TNF-\u00e1 by DCs from the spleen and colic LNs of H. hepaticus-infected and non-infected mice. There was decreased surface expression of CD40, CD86, and MHC II and a decreased percentage of IL-12p40 and TNF-\u00e1-producing DCs from colic LNs of H. hepaticus-infected mice. In contrast, H. hepaticus infection did not inhibit the splenic-derived DCs. In fact, there was increased expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC II on splenic-derived DCs from H. hepaticus-infected mice following in vitro lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. These results indicate that H. hepaticus infection can influence the results of immunological assays in mice and support an argument for the use of H. hepaticus-free mice in immunological research.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3153], "author_name_tesi": "Gulani, Jatinder ", "last_name_ssi": "Gulani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jatinder", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Laboratory Animal Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Catherine Beckwith", "Catherine Beckwith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Catherine Beckwith, Thesis Advisor", "Catherine Beckwith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["immunological research", "Helicobacter hepaticus", "herpes simplex virus type 1", "dendritic cells", "C57BL/6 mice"]}]
