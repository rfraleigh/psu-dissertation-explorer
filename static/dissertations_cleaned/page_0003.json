The pressure response obtained from disturbing the well by (build up, drawdown, drill stem, injection or falloff test) at a controlled flow rate can describe the reservoir rock-fluid system and will usually provide information that will help in estimating: permeability, damage, reservoir extent and the degree of heterogeneity the system possess. These tests are costly in terms of equipment, labor and most importantly the delay caused by halting the production in part of the field during the test. \n\n\tThis study will provide a tool that can help in performing a virtual well test for a reservoir using basic reservoir-production information with partial well test information on the field already available. The ultimate goal is to be able to generate virtual well test data at potential locations to be drilled in future. The importance of this study arises when a considerable amount of reservoir information is not available and, hence, a reservoir model might not be as accurate as it is aimed for. The study starts with a simple scenario with complete homogeneity in terms of uniform thickness, porosity, permeability, a regularly shaped reservoir and constant flow rate wells. Subsequently, the study moves towards more complex domains and field conditions. The fluid system was dry gas and the rock properties were specified according to the scenario complexity. The best network in each scenario was preserved. The artificial neural network tool predicted the pressure transient data over a wide range of selected areas in the reservoir in a short time. When the study moves towards a more complex reservoir system, the proposed ANN network was able to solve the preceding less complex scenario as well and usually with a higher resolution in prediction.\n\n\t At the end of the study, there were 10 different artificial networks each representing a different reservoir and production strategy. These networks were presented in a graphical user interface models to provide an easier communication and better understanding between the models and the end user.  \n\nThere was a good agreement between the expert system and the simulation results which proves the promising applicability of this technique in reservoir engineering and evaluation protocols. The prediction of pressure transient testing by utilizing the developed models will help in a more efficient and better evaluation for the reservoir under study. A preliminary data will be available with minimal cost and no loss of production. \u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7538], "author_name_tesi": "Alabbad, Mohammed Ali", "last_name_ssi": "Alabbad", "middle_name_ssi": "Ali", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Luis F Ayala H", "Yilin Wang", "R Larry Grayson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "R Larry Grayson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["well testing", "neural networks", "pressure transient", "predict"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "The Influnence of a Fracture Tip on Two-Phase Flow Displacement Process\n\n", "id": "6113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work focuses on multi-phase flow in the presence of a fracture tip. Fluid flow interactions between a fracture and the surrounding matrix are not well documented in the literature, especially in the case of a fracture tip. This work studies two-phase fluid flow (Water-Oil) displacements in layered Berea Sandstones that have been artificially fractured with a single extensional fracture perpendicular to the natural layers. Two experiments are considered in this work. In the first experiment, the fracture was induced at the inlet end of the sample and it spanned the first third of the core. Thus, the diverging flow at the tip of the fracture was studied.  In the second experiment, the fracture was induced at the outlet end of the sample and it spanned about one third of the core. Multi-phase fluid flow convergence to the fracture tip was studied in this experiment.  The temporal and spatial saturation distributions of the two cases were determined using x-ray computed tomography, CT.\nThe 4D-CT experimental data and recovery information were used as the basis for simulation in an effort to determine the interaction of fracture-matrix environment with multi-phase flow. At the tip of the fracture, the two experiments showed different fluid flow patterns. The presence of the tip of the fracture in both experiments influenced the displacement path along each layer.\nThe presence of the fracture tip is essential for highlighting the property contrast between the natural layers in the sample, much more than in a displacement process without a fracture.  Matches of the simulation results to the experimental data showed that when the fracture is at the inlet end, fluid diverges from the fracture to the matrix along the entire length of the fracture.  The displaced phase is delayed in the regions neighboring the fracture and it preferentially flowed in the outer regions of the core.\nUnderstanding multi-phase fluid flow in fractured rocks is essential for designing and optimizing hydrocarbon recovery processes. The fluid flow interactions between the fractures and the matrix have a significant impact on displacement processes. This work provides modeling results and experimental observations that explain some of the displacement processes around a fracture tip.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [112], "author_name_tesi": "Alajmi, Abdullah Fahad Faleh", "last_name_ssi": "Alajmi", "middle_name_ssi": "Fahad Faleh", "first_name_ssi": "Abdullah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abraham S Grader", "Turgay Ertekin", "Phillip Michael Halleck", "Derek Elsworth", "Michael Adebola Adewumi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abraham S Grader, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Phillip Michael Halleck, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["experimental work.", "Fracture", "dispalcement", "porous media", "simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "the impact of a pilot program aimed at developing effective school leadership in Kuwait.", "id": "26769", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11606", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the pilot program aimed at developing effective school leadership on Kuwaiti principals\u2019 effectiveness as perceived by teachers in three main domains: organizational development, organizational environment, and instructional leadership.\nSchools were chosen to participate in the pilot program by the Ministry of Education in Kuwait based on recommendations from the six Kuwaiti school districts during the 2012/2013 school year and each school\u2019s interest in joining the pilot program. For this study, I selected 10 schools that had implemented the pilot program (the experimental group), and 10 demographically similar schools that had not implemented the pilot program (the control group). All 725 teachers (experimental = 374; control = 351) who worked in the selected schools completed surveys before and after program implementation. \nThe survey, which was a modified version of the Audit of Principal Effectiveness (APE), included 43 items, with 10 items measuring organizational development, 27 items measuring organizational environment, and 6 measuring instructional leadership. Participants responded to items using a scale ranging from 1 (not effective) to 9 (very effective).\nThe findings reveal that there is a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups\u2019 mean scores for items related to the organizational development domain and organizational environment domain. Higher gain scores are associated with teachers in schools that implemented the pilot program aimed at increasing school principal effectiveness. The findings also reveal that there is no statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups\u2019 mean scores for items related to the instructional leadership domain, indicating that the pilot program did not significantly affect instructional leadership. Furthermore, demographic characteristics (gender, years of experience, educational qualifications, teaching level) had no significant effect on the dependent variable.\nSeveral implications emerged from findings.

Nevertheless, their role is not clear- cut, as there are inconsistencies in epidemiological and preclinical research. One reason may be related to individual differences in susceptibility, differences that can be traced to the genetic constitution of those humans and animals exposed. Taking into account the role of host susceptibility and individual differences in the study of complex traits such as pesticide toxicity will result in better understanding the etiology and pathways involved in the development of complex neurological disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD). Newer epidemiological and animal methods address the role of genes, the environment and their interaction as key. Increased sensitivity to paraquat toxicity, a broadly used herbicide, in C57B6 mice compared to D2 is an example that highlights the importance of genetic constitution and gene-environment interaction. In this thesis, we report a broad response variation to MPTP neurotoxicity in 9-10 strains of BXD recombinant male and female mice. MPTP is a dopaminergic neurotoxin that induces parkinsonism symptoms in humans and animals who have been systemically exposed to it. MPTP neurotoxicity results in a significant reduction of dopamine (DA) concentration in the striatum in humans, primates and mice. C57B6 Mice exposed to a single injection of 30mg/kg MPTP show a 40-50% reduction of the striatal DA concentration. Using genetic reference families such as BXD RI mice with known genetic constitution, allows us to investigate the importance of host susceptibility in response to neurotoxicants including, but not limited to MPTP. Striatal dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, and serotonin and its metabolite, 5-HIAAA, were analyzed by HPLC. DA turnover was assessed using DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios. Striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP), and iron content in ventral midbrain were quantified. All dopamine measures, as well as TH and GFAP, demonstrated wide, genotype-dependent differences in response to MPTP in both sexes. A significant correlation between DA related phenotypes with the exception of DOPAC was observed between males and females, indicating the involvement of\niii\nmultiple factors in dopaminergic neurotoxicity and probably neurological disorders such as PD. Moreover, our data show that the association between MPP+ levels, the active metabolite of MPTP, and the striatal dopamine compromise caused by MPTP treatment is weak and not statistically significant. The results of this thesis support the complex nature of host susceptibility to neurotoxicants in which multiple genes and possibly multiple environmental factors are involved. This systemic approach to the study of environmental neurotoxicants in genetic reference populations of mice is likely to elucidate genetic factors underlying individual differences in developing neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11119], "author_name_tesi": "Alam, Gelareh ", "last_name_ssi": "Alam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gelareh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Byron C Jones", "David John Vandenbergh", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "Shedra Amy Snipes", "Xuemei Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Byron C Jones, Dissertation Advisor", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Chair", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "Shedra Amy Snipes, Committee Member", "Xuemei Huang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Host susceptibility", "MPTP", "Paraquat", "Parkinson's Disease", "Environmental Toxicants"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Size effects on mechanical and thermal properties of thin films ", "id": "26485", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11716", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Materials, from electronic to structural, exhibit properties that are sensitive to their composition and internal microstructures such as grain and precipitate sizes, crystalline phases, defects and dopants. Therefore, the research trend has been to obtain fundamental understanding in processing-structure-properties to develop new materials or new functionalities for engineering applications. The advent of nanotechnology has opened a new dimension to this research area because when material size is reduced to nanoscale, properties change significantly from the bulk values. This phenomenon expands the problem to \u2018size-processing-structure-properties-functionalities\u2019. The reinvigorated research for the last few decades has established size dependency of the material properties such as thermal conductivity, Young\u2019s modulus and yield strength, electrical resistivity, photo-conductance etc. It is generally accepted that classical physical laws can be used to scale down the properties up to 25-50 nm length-scale, below which their significant deviation or even breakdown occur. This dissertation probes the size effect from a different perspective by asking the question, if nanoscale size influences one physical domain, why it would not influence the coupling between two or more domains? Or in other words, if both mechanical and thermal properties are different at the nanoscale, can mechanical strain influence thermal conductivity? The hypothesis of size induced multi-domain coupling is therefore the foundation of this dissertation. It is catalyzed by the only few computational studies available in the literature while experimental validations have been non-existent owing to experimental challenges. The objective of this research is to validate this hypothesis, which will open a novel avenue to tune properties and functionalities of materials with the size induced multi-domain coupling.\nSingle domain characterization itself is difficult at the nanoscale due to specimen preparation, setting up proper boundary conditions and the required resolution in measurement. The scope of this work requires multiple property characterization simultaneously, which makes it even more challenging. To accomplish this goal, several micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) based testing devices have been developed in this work. These devices can integrate sample, tiny heaters, electrodes, actuators and sensors to measure not just one property, but multiple properties, at the same time. An additional advantage of the setup is its inherently small size that allows high-resolution microscopy techniques such as transmission electron microscope (TEM) to visualize the events taking place inside the specimen during the experiments. These devices were then used to characterize both single and multi-domain studies as highlighted below.\nAs a first step towards multi-domain characterization, this research explored the mechanical behavior (microstructural effects on deformation and failure) of metallic thin films. For example, in-situ TEM study of aluminum thin films under fatigue loading showed that deformation mechanism in nanoscale is remarkably different from that of bulk scale. In bulk material, dislocation based activity due to fatigue loading leads to formation of persistent slip bands (PSB) and failure of material through crack formation. However, 200 nm thick aluminum specimens with average gain size of 80 nm showed no signs of dislocation activities. Instead, elastic or reversible rotation of the grains is observed; a deformation mechanism that is proposed to make the specimens insensitive to stress concentration and fatigue. Consequently, not a single sample failed even after a million cycle of loading at 0.1% and 0.4% tensile strain. \nAs a continuation of the single domain studies towards multi-domain characterization, influence of stress and temperature on the grain size of nickel thin films is studied next. Grain size plays a major role on the mechanical and thermal properties of thin films. Commonly, thermal annealing is used in the literature to control grain size. Irradiation also has strong effects on grain size. Less known is the phenomenon of mechanical stress assisted grain growth. The in-situ TEM experiments on 75 nm thick, 5-10 nm average grain size platinum specimens show rapid grain growth above 290 MPa stress and 0.14% strain. The associated strain energy is found to be higher than that required for stable interface motion but lower than the stress required for unstable grain boundary motion. This is attributed to geometrical incompatibility arising out of crystallographic mis-orientation in adjoining grains, or in other words, geometrically necessary grain growth. Since temperature plays a strong role in grain boundary mobility, this study was expanded to thermo-mechanical loading scenario. The experimental results suggest a unique synergy \u2013 as evident from large grain growth in 100 nm thick, 10 nm average grain size nickel at only 325 MPa stress and 373 K temperature. In comparison, the yield stress and melting point (Tm) are about 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 GPa and 1730 K. Such low temperature \u2013 low stress synergy towards large grain growth is remarkably different from the literature, which involves high temperature (T/Tm > 0.5) to achieve any appreciable grain growth. \nTo study the thermal transport, a novel approach based on infrared microscopy is developed.  This technique uses energy conservation principle to establish the mathematical model and combines the model with experimentally measured sample temperature to determine the thermal conductivity of thin film. This method is used successfully to measure the thermal conductivity of ultra-thin films (10 nm and 20 nm thick hexagonal boron nitride) as well as regular thin films (200 nm amorphous silicon film, 200-500 nm thick carbon doped oxide). This work also presents an experimental technique to measure heat transfer coefficient in micro and nano scale. The heat transfer coefficient for air is roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the bulk value and found to be dependent on the size and temperature of sample. It is suggested that the dominant heat transfer mode in this case is solid to air heat conduction. This work gives an empirical relationship to predict the heat transfer coefficient for different sample size and temperature.  \nTo investigate the central hypothesis, i.e. size induced coupling between mechanical strain and thermal conductivity of material, multi-domain experiments are carried out. A major contribution of this dissertation is the experimental validation of this hypothesis. It has been shown that thermal conductivity of material in nano scale can be tuned by mechanical stress. Thermal conductivity of 50 nm thick freestanding silicon nitride thin film is found to be decreased by an order of magnitude with 2.4% tensile strain. Classical thermal physics does not predict such change. It is hypothesized that energy transfer in amorphous insulating solids depends heavily on the vibration localization, i.e. hopping mode, which is sensitive to mechanical strain. Increased localization of vibrations under tensile strain is the cause of thermal conductivity reduction. Another work on 200 nm thick freestanding amorphous silicon thin film shows the opposite trend i.e. increase of thermal conductivity with applied tensile strain. This is also novel because amorphous materials are not predicted to show any such effect. A closer look in the microstructure of the material during the experiment indicates that stress induced grain growth or phase transformation might be the major contributor for this increase in thermal conductivity. \nAnother key contribution of this dissertation is the observation of the mechanical stress dependent dielectric breakdown behavior in carbon doped oxide thin film. When electrical voltage is applied across a dielectric film, a very small amount of leakage current is measured across the material. The amount of leakage current increases with the increase of applied electrical field. As applied electrical field is increased gradually, the material fails at some point, which is known as the \u201cbreakdown\u201d of the dielectric material. In this research work, it has been shown that mechanical stress alone can influence the amount of leakage current of the material, even though the applied electrical field is kept same throughout the process. This behavior is ascribed to the de-trapping of electrons under mechanical strain. \nThis dissertation showed experimental evidence of length scale induced coupling between thermal, mechanical and electrical domains. The technological aspect of this research impacts micro and opto electronics, energy conversion, sensors and actuators and in general, nanotechnology applications. However, it is also very fundamental in nature, and the new phenomena that are explored will enrich knowledge of material behavior and lay foundation for the future work on multi-physics of material at nano scale.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11201], "author_name_tesi": "Alam, Md Tarekul", "last_name_ssi": "Alam", "middle_name_ssi": "Tarekul", "first_name_ssi": "Md", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Md Amanul Haque", "Zoubeida Ounaies", "Donghai Wang", "Charles E Bakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Dissertation Advisor", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Chair", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin films", "nano scale", "thermal", "mechanical", "size effect", "coupling of properties", "micro scale"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "IMPROVING ENERGY SIMULATION ACCURACY OF NEW AND RENOVATED HEALTHCARE BUILDINGS ", "id": "19734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9325", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research is to improve the accuracy of building energy simulation for healthcare buildings by identifying and modifying key input parameters. The thesis will use the modified parameters in simulating case-study hospital buildings to correctly predict the buildings\u2019 energy behavior.  Hospital buildings have been major energy consumers with a significant contribution to the total annual energy consumption in commercial buildings. Based on Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), the total energy used by a typical hospital building per square-foot is more than two times the use of a typical office building. Therefore, there is a need to enable accurate and reliable energy simulation models to accurately predict the energy-use of new buildings and study the feasibility of different renovation and retrofit strategies that could lead to energy savings for retrofit projects. \nThere are three case studies for this research. The first case-study is the five-story Hershey Cancer Institute, part of the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, located in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The cancer institute is an example of a new LEED\u00ae certified hospital Building.\nThe second case-study is the twelve-story Bluemle Life Sciences building, part of the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This building is an example of a simple-renovation project. The facility is mainly biomedical laboratory spaces. The renovation of this building was mainly the conversion of one of the air-handling units from constant-air-volume (CAV) system to variable-air-volume (VAV) and the installation of new controls on that unit and the supported air-distribution boxes.\nThe third and final case-study is the nine-story Clinical Sciences building, also part of the Hershey medical campus. This is an example of a building that has gone through a major renovation where the entire air distribution system of the building was converted from CAV system to VAV system in three phases. \nThe energy managers of both facilities provided building plans as well as metered energy consumption data. In addition, energy predictions provided by the consulting firm overseeing the first case-study, the Cancer Institute, were provided for comparison with the research simulation results.\nRecent studies examine impacts of influencing input parameters that affect the energy simulation results for hospital buildings. The influencing parameters that many research publications recommend in their sensitivity analyses are:  load and lighting densities, schedules of equipment, lighting and occupants, ventilation, and temperature and humidity set-points. Each input parameter is then modified to values obtained from applicable building codes, previous research, and technical reports. The research simulates the energy consumption of the case-studies using EnergyPlus engine. Comparison between simulation models using the program defaults and the modified values are then compared to actual metered data to measure the accuracy and the influence of the parameters on the simulation. \nIn Hershey Cancer institute, the simulation accuracy of the electric energy of the modified model shows a considerable improvement over the default model and a good agreement with the metered data (8.70 % average monthly and 16% annual). In addition, the pattern of predicted energy, which represents the electricity demand, also followed the actual energy use pattern.\nIn Bluemle Life Sciences building, the facility manager provided both metered electrical (including cooling) and metered gas (representing heating) data. The comparisons between electric metered data and modified simulation show that the monthly and annual simulated energy consumptions are very close having an average monthly accuracy of 4.6% and 4.8% annually. Thermal consumption, on the other hand, was more challenging in meeting uncertainty indices but the overall accuracy of the total thermal energy remained at an average monthly of 10.3% and 9.3% annual . \nIn the Clinical Science building, the comparisons between metered and modified simulation show that the monthly and annual simulated electricity consumptions remain within a good agreement, 12.63% average monthly and 7.2% annual, with the metered electric data. Although no metered thermal data were provided, analysis of simulation results was significant. Changes of CAV to VAV systems had noticeable savings on the heating and cooling energy consumptions in both default and modified models; however, modified model predicts 26.7 % and 15.1% heating and cooling energy savings, respectively, compared to the default model that predicts 42% reduction in heating and 18.8% reduction in cooling energy savings.\nThe results from the accuracy measures obtained from each case-study after the parameter modification provide a great example of the effectiveness and influence the changes of parameters have on energy modeling. For future research and to improve the validation of this current research, there is a need for more case-studies from different climate zones where these parameters can be tested. Another potential research that can stem from this thesis is using the same process of accuracy improvement by identifying and modifying key parameters for different types of commercial buildings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9129], "author_name_tesi": "Alanqar, Ibrahim W", "last_name_ssi": "Alanqar", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Ibrahim", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Stephen James Treado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jelena Srebric, Thesis Advisor", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen James Treado, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Healthcare", "energy", "energy simulation", "sensitivity analysis", "simulation accuracy", "retrofit", "laboratory", "hospital"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "CERAMIC COATINGS FOR NUCLEAR FUEL CLADDING TO ENHANCE ACCIDENT TOLERANCE", "id": "15347exa179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15347", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research is focused on developing nuclear fuel claddings with ceramic coatings that can perform well during normal operation and can withstand transient conditions such as loss of coolant accident for longer durations than current cladding material and then provide longer coping times. This was done by creating TiAlN coatings using physical vapor deposition and optimizing the deposition parameters and multilayer architecture to achieve the best performance.\nZirconium-based alloys are currently widely used as cladding materials due to their low neutron absorption cross-section, good mechanical properties and high melting point. However, waterside corrosion of these alloys cause zirconium oxide formation and hydrogen generation which leads to hydrogen pick up and hydride embrittlement. Moreover, hydrogen generation in case of accelerated corrosion at higher temperatures due to loss of active cooling can lead to hydrogen explosions such as observed in the Fukushima-Daiichi accident when hydrogen explosions in the reactor building worsened the accident conditions. This accident motivated research into Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF), which are fuels that are more forgiving in case of a loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA). This research is an innovative approach since it considers application of TiN and TiAlN ceramic coatings on ZIRLO\u00ae substrate by cathodic arc physical vapor deposition (CA-PVD), which improve corrosion resistance without a major change in core design and contribute to the design safety.\nCathodic arc physical vapor deposition was used since it provides flexibility in coating properties by adjustment of deposition parameters. A systematic study was performed to identify the optimum deposition parameters to achieve enhanced adhesion of nitride-based coatings on ZIRLO\u00ae substrates and best corrosion performance. The developed coatings are subjected to scratch tests and long-term corrosion tests. First, the single-layer TiAlN and single-layer TiN coating deposition on ZIRLO\u00ae sheets were characterized in detail with regards to their as-deposited coating properties (topography, uniformity, crystal structure, residual stresses), failure modes during scratch testing and oxide formation after corrosion testing. Second, a multilayer coating design architecture is investigated to achieve enhanced corrosion resistance. Then the 8-layer TiN/TiAlN coatings deposited on ZIRLO\u00ae tubes were exposed to long-term corrosion testing. Throughout the study, the following parameters were optimized to provide best corrosion resistance: (i) substrate surface roughness, (ii) substrate surface preparation method, (iii) titanium bond coating layer thickness, (iv) total coating thickness, (v) cathode composition, (vi) substrate bias, (vii) nitrogen partial pressure and (viii) multilayer design architecture.\nMechanical performance evaluation involved scratch testing and post-scratched sample failure mode characterization. The corrosion tests were performed at Westinghouse in autoclave in static pure water at 360\u00baC and 18.7 MPa up to 128 days in order to evaluate the normal operating condition performance of the coatings. Furthermore, supercritical water testing was performed in University of Michigan autoclave at in deaerated water at 542\u00baC and 24.5 MPa for 48 hours.

Wear occurs due to interaction between abrasive soils and cutters, as well as other components of the machine which come into contact with the muck. However, the lack of a standard or universally accepted test for soil abrasivity in geotechnical investigations has made the prediction of tool wear a difficult task. \nThe primary objective of this thesis was to develop a new test device, specifically designed to simulate the working conditions of soft-ground mechanized tunneling as much as possible and quantify different soil types in terms of abrasivity. The testing system which directly measures the wear on wear plates mounted on a propeller that is submerged in a chamber filled with soil is capable of simulating the high contact stresses between the tool and the soil, maintaining the original soil size distribution, field moisture conditions, and the possibility of applying high ambient pressures as well as soil conditioners. \nSeveral key testing parameters such as soil overburden, pitch angle of the propeller, tool material hardness, moisture content, ambient pressure, particle angularity, grain size distribution, propeller speed, and applied torque to the soil were studied in order to see the impact of these parameters on soil abrasion. The parametric study was performed on various soil samples with known properties including grain size distribution, mineral content, and grain sphericity and roundness.  This included high quartz-content Silica sand, Limestone sand, ASTM Graded sand, ASTM 20/30 sand and a sample of Silty sand. Based on the results of the parametric study, which showed the importance of soil particle size and angularity, moisture content, ambient pressure, etc. on soil abrasion, a standard setting for the testing system was selected. The standard setting includes a rotational speed of 60 rpm, a propeller pitch angle of 10o, and cover hardness of 17 HRC.  In the standard setting, tests were performed at various moisture contents including dry sample, soil with water content dry of optimum compaction, and saturated soil.\nBy using the standard setting, the Penn State Soil Abrasion Index (PSAI) is developed in order to allow comparisons of the weight loss of covers in the same testing conditions for different soil types. The variation of wear on the cover as a function of time is expressed by using a power function in which W=ATb, where W is the wear in grams, T is time in minutes, and A and b are constants defining the shape of the curve.\nIn addition, a study on the effect of relative hardness on soil abrasion was performed in both dry and moist conditions. In this study, different cover hardness (17-60 HRC) and mixtures of Silica sand and Limestone sand at controlled proportions were used to create variable ratios of tool/mineral hardness. This study confirmed that the anticipated inverted S-curve that is well-known in tribology studies can be generated when the tool hardness is kept constant and material hardness is changed by changing the mixing ratio of abrasive and non-abrasive soils.  The change in tool hardness will shift the inverted S-curve, meaning that the absolute value of relative hardness is not the determining factor for wear.  Furthermore, the behavior of the tribological system and wear of tools in various soil mixtures will change with the presence of water.\nMoreover, the effect of reducing the wear and torque by using soil conditioners is studied by using the testing device. The testing of various soil types by the soil abrasion testing device shows that the application of proper soil conditioning can reduce the abrasion, and hence the wear of the tools and inner parts of the tunneling machine as well as give a significant reduction of the required torque.  The magnitude of the reduced wear and torque could be measured in the testing device.\nFinally, a comparison was made between the Soil Abrasion Test (SAT) testing system developed by SINTEF/NTNU and the Penn State Soil Abrasion Testing system. This study showed several advantages of the Penn State Soil Abrasion system as compared to the SAT testing system such as quantifying the abrasivity of the fine-grained soil, non-abrasive material, and impacts of sphericity and roundness of the particles. The PSAI testing offers less operator sensitivity and higher repeatability and consistency of the test results, combination of two- and three-body abrasion as a main wear method, ability to perform tests with different moisture contents and by applying different ambient pressure, and there is no need for a change of grain size and shape of the soil samples during the sample preparation.\nThe outcome of this study can be used for establishing a framework to assist in quantifying the abrasivity of the soil during the design phase of the mechanized soft-ground tunnels and understanding the key soil properties and operational parameters influencing the wear phenomena in soft-ground mechanized tunneling.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8301], "author_name_tesi": "Alavi Gharahbagh, Ehsan ", "last_name_ssi": "Alavi Gharahbagh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ehsan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami", "Jamal Rostami", "Dr Larry Grayson", "Tong Qiu", "Antonio Nieto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Chair", "Dr Larry Grayson, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Soil Abrasion", "Tool wear", "Soft-ground mechanized tunneling", "EPB and Slurry TBM", "Wear Prediction", "Soil Conditioning"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Impact of iPad on Kuwaiti children's play: mother prospectives", "id": "24908", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11206", "abstract_tesi": "Play is an essential component of children\u2019s lives.

The results indicate that there are negligible benefits to changing blade collective pitch, twist, chord, and airfoil characteristics. Only radius increase has a dominant effect, with 20% increase in radius resulting in power increase of over 45% at 8 and 10 m/s and much higher percentage increases at lower speeds, for both turbines (as the power in the wind increases in proportion to the radius squared). The increase in annual energy production is in the range of 20%. However, a larger radius increases blade loading.

These drugs revolutionized the treatment of psychotic disorders because they lacked the debilitating movement side effects, sedation and hypotension that plagued first generation compounds.  However, post-marketing studies revealed unexpected side effects of these atypical drugs, including obesity and diabetes.  The aim of this project was to develop a rodent model of these metabolic effects in order to identify potential mechanisms involved in the diabetes and obesity observed clinically.\nAnimal models of the obesity and insulin resistance side effects were developed that showed similarities to the clinical situation, including hyperphagia, weight gain, increased adiposity and insulin resistance.  Sexually dimorphic effects were observed in rats; for example, whereas females became obese, males accumulated adiposity without increased body weight gain.  In female rats, the mechanism underlying this hyperphagia appears to be an acute lowering of the circulating concentration of several satiety factors, including glucose, insulin and leptin.\nChronic olanzapine did not alter food intake or body weight in male rats, although they exhibited increased adiposity and insulin resistance.  Several factors likely contribute to the increased fat mass.  First, male rats provided olanzapine displayed decreased physical activity but maintained food intake.  Thus, food intake did not decline to compensate for the level of activity.  This relative hyperphagia was associated with lowering of plasma leptin.  Other metabolic changes in these animals that favor increased adiposity include increased nutrient partitioning to fat and decreased fat mobilization in response to fasting or isoproterenol.  Insulin resistance occurred acutely in male rats, suggesting that it was a direct drug effect and not secondary to adiposity.  It was also tissue-specific, only affecting the heart and skeletal muscles and not fat, which exhibited either unaffected or improved insulin sensitivity.\nA recent retrospective study of patients revealed a major new side effect of atypical antipsychotics, increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to a ventricular arrhythmia that is frequently associated with metabolic disorders.  Plasma free fatty acids, the heart\u2019s preferred fuel, were lowered by olanzapine in our model.  Acute studies revealed that this was due not only to impaired in vivo lipolysis, but also to a robust shift in the use of lipid fuels.  This shift was confirmed by alterations in plasma nutrients after food deprivation, rapid and robust declines in respiratory exchange ratio, improved triglyceride tolerance without changes in hepatic secretion, and elevated FFA uptake (~2-fold or greater) into most tissues.  Notably, the heart appeared to be more severely insulin resistant than other tissues and olanzapine did not stimulate uptake of FFAs as it did in other tissues.  Furthermore, olanzapine increased heart rate without changing blood pressure or stroke volume.  These results suggest that olanzapine may elevate cardiac risk by simultaneously causing cardiac insulin resistance, repartitioning of fatty fuels and tachycardia, while decreasing availability of free fatty acids from lipolysis.  The olanzapine-induced metabolic inflexibility may explain its glucose sparing and glucose intolerance effects.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6405], "author_name_tesi": "Albaugh, Vance Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Albaugh", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Vance", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Lynch", "Christopher J Lynch", "Charles H Lang", "Robert Nickerson Cooney", "Yuguang Shi, Ph D", "Andras Hajnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Lynch, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Robert Nickerson Cooney, Committee Member", "Yuguang Shi, Ph D, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metabolic syndrome", "hyperphagia", "obesity", "insulin resistance", "diabetes", "clozapine", "olanzapine", "antipsychotic drugs", "respiratory exchange ratio", "hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp", "glucose tolerance"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "State Space Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Switched RLCM Networks", "id": "21183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9898", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design process for power converters and electromechanical drives would be enhanced by the availability of modeling software that represents the fundamental nature of these systems, namely, switch-mode operation of the semiconductor devices. Established network simulation programs, such as SPICE and its many descendants, utilize a combination of companion models and modified nodal analysis (CM + MNA) that permits very simple implementations of algorithms for simulating the dc, ac, and transient response of most electrical networks. In the early days of computer modeling, the simplicity of these algorithms was critically important while the attention being given to networks with switch-mode operation was modest and focused on digital logic. Thus, SPICE (CM + MNA) became the de facto standard for network simulation. It can be used for transient simulation of power converters, but it is inherently slow and can provide little insight beyond the raw time-domain response of the converter. These limitations can be addressed by replacing CM + MNA with state space modeling (SSM).\nIdeal switches, the main subject of this thesis, impose computational difficulty to simulation software.

Set within a post hospice bereavement program context, this research pursued how these bereaved adults, who identified music as a critical component to their grief process, came to understand and accept their loss through musical means.\n\tThis qualitative study was grounded in a constructivist learning theory, informed by Kubler Ross\u2019s stages of grief and music as a way of knowing. Constructivism offered a strong basis for understanding the individual and social learning which occurred during the grief processes of the participants. Additionally, consideration of factors such as spirituality, culture, emotion, identity and context, which are part of musical knowing and important to the participants of this study, were considered and included within the larger learning theory.\n\tData collection was completed through two individual interviews, a music elicitation exercise, and field notes and journaling completed by the researcher. The combination of the interviews with the music elicitation exercise created a wonderful opportunity to capture perceptions of the past and combine them with new thoughts about how the music impacted and continued to aid in their healing and coping. The resulting narratives provided rich descriptions of their individual stories and specific ways in which music played a role in their learning during the grief process.\t\t\t\tConsideration of the data revealed that there are three main areas which have implications for the fields of adult education, hospice bereavement, grief counseling, \nmusic therapy and related disciplines. The first described the significant relationship between music and emotion, and how it facilitated the expression of, distraction from and reflection on the emotional aspects of the grieving of these participants. Additionally, music\u2019s role in the changed identity of the participants was noted. The second area addressed the interconnection of music with the participant\u2019s sense of community, culture and spirituality, and how that impacted the grief process.

It also noted how participation with music and with this research project created new understandings for the six people who shared their stories, and how that impacted their on-going grief processes.\n\tFollowing these findings is a detailed description of how music as a way of knowing, especially in relation to the strong link between musical form and emotion, facilitated the learning in this group of participants.

But, based upon a literature review, institutions devote a more resources to other intellectual property activities\u2014plagiarism detection, technology transfer and illegal file sharing management\u2014than for general copyright education activities.  Utilizing Mintzberg\u2019s organizational model and its discussion of organizational placement and legitimacy as a conceptual framework, this study explores the current copyright education structures among the universities that comprise the Consortium on Institutional Cooperation, otherwise known as the CIC or the Big Ten, to determine whether organizational placement, credentials of individuals, and resources devoted to this activity affect the legitimacy of the office and the authority of copyright officers to fulfill their responsibilities. The results of this study suggest that organizational placement, while it plays a role, is not nearly as important as the credentials of the individual in the position in conveying legitimacy.  A credential not only suggests a level of educational attainment and expertise; it also, perhaps more subtly, conveys to a community that the institution is willing to commit resources to this activity in the form of salary expenditures.  In fact, shifting an activity such as copyright information management closer to the administrative core, and thus lending it more legitimacy, could backfire, resulting in fewer faculty members and graduate students willing to partake of the service due to their concerns about administrative motivation and interference.  Thus, the recommendations offered, based upon this study\u2019s results, include placing general copyright education within the university library, which Mintzberg defines as a support unit, but reclaiming legitimacy that  may be lost in this placement with the appointment of a copyright officer who holds a Juris Doctorate, and preferably a Master\u2019s in Library Science as well.

We investigated BHP production in environmental samples and cultures across a range of geochemical gradients.

These methods were applied to the analysis of BHPs in environmental samples and laboratory cultures of bacteria.\nIn the Frasassi cave system, Italy, we find evidence for multiple BHP producers in the cave stream waters and sediments. The BHP structures present and the abundances of particular structures suggest the sediments contain sulfur-reducing, BHP-producing bacteria (Blumenberg et al., 2005). Using a 13C labeling experiment we find that autotrophs within a sulfur-cycling community produce BHPs and we propose Beggiatoa, a filamentous, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, as a likely BHP producer in the system. Our analyses show that the 13C label is incorporated into the sugar moiety tail of the BHP structures preferentially indicating that these polar groups turn over biochemically much faster than the isoprenoid hydrocarbon. \nAcidithiobacillus thiooxidans produce BHPs in both cultures and snottite biofilms. In culture A. thiooxidans produces more BHPs with a decrease in pH. The cell count of A. ferroxidans, in an acid mine drainage stream, correlates with decrease in pH and an increase in total BHPs. This suggests BHPs help decrease proton transport across cell membranes by lowering permeability. In samples from Rio Tinto, Spain, we find that the iron-oxidizing bacteria Leptospirillum is a major producer of 3Me-BHPs as a member of a biofilm, in a plaktonic lifestyle, and in culture. In culture, this bacterium produces more BHPs when fixing nitrogen than assimilating nitrate. \nWe find that Anabaena variabilis, a freshwater cyanobacterium, produces more BHPs when living as a photoautotroph and less when living as a chemoheterotroph. Notably, when A. variabilis is phototrophic, the bacterium produces more BHPs when fixing nitrogen than assimilating nitrate. These results indicate that BHPs may have a role in protecting the nitrogenase enzyme and the photosystem. Lastly, we find that a seasonal red pigmented biofilm is the major BHP producer in the Little Salt Spring, Florida. Important to paleoenvironment interpretations, this system produces C2 methylated BHPs in large quantities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2194], "author_name_tesi": "Albrecht, Heidi Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Albrecht", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Heidi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady", "Christopher Howard House", "John Michael Regan", "Jennifer Macalady", "Katherine Haines Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Macalady, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["bacteriohopanepolyols", "hopanoid", "geochemistry", "biogeochemistry", "organic geochemistry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS\u2019 ADVENTURE BASED\n \nCOUNSELING EXPERIENCE: \n\nA CASE STUDY\n\n", "id": "11652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5178", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "General education, middle school students\u2019 experience and outcomes related to their participation in adventure based interventions were investigated through the use of qualitative research case study design.

More specifically, the research investigates how students for whom English is a second or third language manage to negotiate the challenges of academic English during a study abroad experience at a U.S. university.\n\tThe study explores the particular challenges that study abroad students in the U.S. specifically, and second language speakers in general, face in the areas of reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  The students in the study were enrolled in credited content classes for the duration of their study abroad program without the benefit of an English as a second language (ESL) class that would have assisted them in the process.  The students had to address the demands of academic text and all typical academic requirements associated with university coursework.  They had to negotiate academic literacy in a language other than their own.\n\tThe section on reading presents the challenge of drawing meaning from academic written text at the university level and the unexpected hurdles that emerge in the process, such as outside reading materials that do not adhere to textbook organization standards.  The second language learners reported problems with both high-frequency and low-frequency vocabulary.  They were perplexed by the use of familiar (e.g., informal, conversational) and metaphoric language in textbooks and frequent references to U.S. history and culture in textbooks dealing with subjects other than history and/or culture per se.  \n\tThe section on writing illustrates the demands placed on second language learners in writing for display and writing for learning.  Writing a critical review, which entails the ability to draw information from the text, relate it to other sources of information, assume a stance, and develop a persuasive argument, also posed problems for these students.  Additionally, incorporating cultural and historical references in written text was an unfamiliar process for them.  \n\tThe section on listening and speaking covers the skills that were required of these ESL students in understanding and using spoken text.  They were challenged with the spontaneity of oral/aural discourse.  They had to follow the information presented in class lectures.  They needed to interact with professors and classmates in the classroom.  In addition, they were required to make academic oral presentations in front of a class.\n\tThe findings of this dissertation illustrate that a TOEFL score is not an adequate indication of guaranteed success in the academic setting of a U.S. university.  Second language learners face many unanticipated challenges for which their English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classes in their home institutions did not prepare them.\n\tI hope that this dissertation will inspire further studies on the challenges of ESL students in U.S. universities so that we can provide a positive environment for their experience.  The success of international educational exchanges derives from positive experiences of students in learning, sharing, and interacting within the cross-cultural academic environment of a U.S. university.  \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [837], "author_name_tesi": "Alco, Bonnie ", "last_name_ssi": "Alco", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bonnie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan G Strauss", "Susan G Strauss", "Robert William Schrauf", "Jacqueline Edmondson", "Meredith Christine Doran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan G Strauss, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan G Strauss, Committee Chair", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Member", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["academic discourse", "second language acquisition", "ESL"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Tractable Radar Waveform Design Under Practical Constraints", "id": "14202osa105", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14202", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Waveform design is one of the central aspects of radar systems. It can determine many of the radar properties. A well-designed waveform can improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enable suitable delay (range) resolution, and utilize the spectrum efficiently. Moreover, for multiple array radar system, waveform diversity can be employed to enhance the flexibility of the transmit beampattern design and enable efficient management of radar radiation power in directions of interest.\n\nWhile unconstrained waveform design is straightforward, a key open challenge is to enforce some of the significant practical constraints of constant modulus, waveform similarity and spectral interference constraints. Incorporating these constraints in an analytically tractable manner is a longstanding open challenge. This is due to the fact that the optimization problem subject to these constraints is a hard non-convex problem. Decades of the past work have shown a stiff trade-off between analytical tractability (achieved by relaxations to manageable constraints) and realistic design that exactly obeys these practical constraints but is computationally troublesome. In this dissertation, we propose a new framework that breaks this classical trade-off.\n\nIn the first part, we address the problem of a joint transmit waveform and receive filter design for radar systems under the important practical constraints of constant modulus and waveform similarity. We develop a new analytical approach that involves solving a sequence of convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programing (QCQP) problems, which we prove converges to a sub-optimal solution. Because an improvement in SINR results via solving each problem in the sequence, we call the method Successive QCQP Refinement (SQR).  We evaluate SQR against other candidate techniques with respect to SINR performance, beampattern and pulse compression properties in a variety of scenarios. Results show that SQR outperforms state of the art methods that also employ constant modulus and/or similarity constraints while being computationally less burdensome.\n\n\nIn the second part, we address the problem of designing a beampattern for Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar, which in turn is determined by the transmit waveform. A new approach is proposed in our work, which involves solving the hard non-convex problem of beampattern design using a sequence of convex equality constrained Quadratic Programs (QP), each of which has a closed form solution. The converged solution achieves constant modulus and satisfies the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, which we prove formally is possible under realistic assumptions. We evaluate the proposed successive closed forms (SCF) algorithm against state-of-the-art MIMO beampattern design techniques and show that SCF breaks the trade-off between desirable performance and the associated computation cost. Furthermore, we address the problem of designing a beampattern for MIMO radar under a spectral interference constraint, which in turn is determined by the transmitted waveform, as well as the constant modulus constraint. One key challenge when jointly enforcing the spectral interference constraint and the constant modulus constraint is to ensure feasibility of the optimization problem. A new approach is proposed in our work, which also involves solving a sequence of constrained quadratic programs, each of which results in a closed form solution.  We formally prove that feasible set of each QP problem in the proposed beampattern optimization under interference constraint and the constant modulus constraint (BIC) algorithm is always non-empty. We evaluate BIC algorithm against the state-of-the-art MIMO beampattern design techniques under the constant modulus constraint and show that BIC achieves a higher performance while maintaining a low spectral interference level in the desired bands.\n\nIn the final part of this dissertation, we address the problem of radar ambiguity function shaping. Ambiguity function shaping continues to be one of the most challenging open problems in cognitive radar. Analytically, a complex quartic function should be optimized as a function of the radar waveform code. We develop a new approach called Adaptive Sequential Refinement (ASR) to suppress the clutter returns for a desired range-Doppler, i.e. ambiguity function response. ASR solves the aforementioned optimization problem in a unique iterative manner such that the formulation is updated depending on the iteration index. We establish formally that: 1.) the problem in each step of the iteration has a closed form solution, and 2.) monotonic decrease of the cost function until convergence is guaranteed. Experimental validation shows that  ASR perform better than state of the art alternatives even as its computational burden is orders of magnitude lower.\n\nIn summary, this dissertation develop a new sequence of convex problems approaches towards solving the hard non-convex problems that appear in practical radar waveform design. Finally, we present some ideas for future research which address waveform design for cooperative radar-communication systems optimization, MIMO ambiguity function shaping and waveform design for autonomous vehicle.

One\u2019s beliefs on a certain subject can be based on tacit assumptions, whereas one\u2019s knowledge can be based on empirical evidence about that subject. Although beliefs and knowledge are two different entities, they may not be easily distinguished in one\u2019s thought system. Specifically, one\u2019s beliefs and knowledge merge with each other in time. \n      Teachers\u2019 pedagogical constructions include their beliefs, which teachers may rely on to make decisions related to learning environment, learning, and learner. Also, teachers\u2019 interactions with parents of young children can be affected by their beliefs about parent involvement. In the context of ECE teacher education, ECE preservice-teachers\u2019 beliefs about young children, their parents, and teaching can affect how the preservice-teachers build their pedagogical knowledge.

These contacts also require good thermal stability, since GeTe is a phase change material that switches back and forth between the amorphous and crystalline states through controlled Joule or laser heating. In this thesis, the role of metal selection, pre-metallization surface treatments, and post-metallization annealing on the resistance of Ohmic contacts to GeTe is examined.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize surfaces of polycrystalline \u03b1-GeTe films after different surface treatments, including UV-O3, in-situ Ar+ ion etching, deionized water (DI H2O), ammonium sulfide (NH4)2S, and hydrochloric acid (HCl), in an effort to understand the effect of pre-metallization surface treatments on the resistance of different metal/GeTe contacts. The combination of UV-O3 and subsequent oxide removal procedures affect the GeTe surface stoichiometry, as does Ar+ plasma without UV-O3 treatment. Ar+ plasma, DI H2O, and (NH4)2S preparations leave the GeTe surface richer in Ge compared to the HCl treatment, which leaves the surface Te-rich.\nThe thesis focuses on contacts based on three different metals: Ni, Au, and Mo.  The trend in the as-deposited specific contact resistance (\u03c1c) as a function of surface treatments demonstrated a strong dependence on the choice of the metal used. For Ni-based contacts, different surface treatments resulted in \u03c1c \u2248 4 \u00d7 10-8 \u03a9.cm2, except for the HCl treatment, which resulted in contacts with much higher resistance, due to formation of a 5nm thick layer of Ni1.29Te at the interface. A constant \u03c1c \u2248 1.2 \u00d7 10-8 \u03a9.cm2 was found for Au (100 nm) contacts, regardless of the surface treatment used. For Mo-based contacts, in-situ Ar+ plasma treatment provided the lowest \u03c1c \u2248 7 \u00b1 1 \u00d7 10-9 \u03a9.cm2. These measurements were made using a refined transfer length method (RTLM) test structure; we found that our circular transfer length test structure (CTLM) provided inaccurate results due to the effect of the metal sheet resistance on the extraction of such very low values of specific contact resistance.\n\nWe discuss how phase diagrams can be used to understand interfacial reactions and predict which metallizations could provide long-term thermal stability. As expected from our calculated phase diagram, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that reaction occurs between Ni and GeTe, even at room temperature. After annealing, there is an increase in contact resistance along with serious morphological changes in the metallization. Au contacts are unreactive on GeTe, even after annealing at 350 \u00b0C for 30 min. However, volatilization of tellurium still occurs through openings that appear in the gold film. Mo-based contacts may be reactive, but the kinetics of the reaction are much slower than the Ni case. An increase in \u03c1c values was observed after annealing, regardless of the metallization.\nThe similarity of as-deposited contact resistances obtained with very different metal work functions points to Fermi level pinning at the surface of GeTe. Moreover, the low values of the specific contact resistances correspond to low Schottky barrier heights. Finally, this thesis points to possible routes to maintain the lowest achievable \u03c1c without loss of thermal stability.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12555], "author_name_tesi": "Aldosari, Haila Mohammed", "last_name_ssi": "Aldosari", "middle_name_ssi": "Mohammed", "first_name_ssi": "Haila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Patrick M Lenahan", "S Ashok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Dissertation Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Member", "S Ashok, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phase change material (PCM)", "GeTe", "Mo", "Ni", "Au", "contact", "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)", "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FLESH AND BONE: UNAMUNO\u2019S \u201cQUIXOTISM\u201d AS AN INCARNATION OF KIERKEGAARD\u2019S \u201cRELIGIOUSNESS A\u201d\n\n", "id": "10751", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3947", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation explores the philosophical kinship between the existentialist thinkers S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) and Miguel de Unamuno (1864-1936) in an attempt to resurrect an ethically religious way of life.\n\nIn Kierkegaard\u2019s writings one can find a description of a passionately committed way of life that is distinguishable from both his conception of ethics and his version of Christianity. He calls this form of ethical religion or religious ethics \u201cReligiousness A,\u201d but he fails to give a vivid illustration of it that definitively distinguishes it from ethics and Christianity. As a result, the scholarship on Religiousness A is impoverished, and what would otherwise amount to a promising new way of being religious in a secular world has been largely regarded as unimportant or simply a watered-down version of Christianity. \n\nMiguel de Unamuno (1864-1936) read the complete works of Kierkegaard in the original Danish, and he was largely responsible for introducing Kierkegaard to the Spanish-speaking world. Unamuno\u2019s Quixotism, modeled after Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 fictional hero Don Quixote, unites passion with commitment while emphasizing community, effectively combining the best aspects of both ethics and Christianity while rejecting their mythic incompatibility. In other words, Unamuno\u2019s Quixotism is a vivid example of Kierkegaard\u2019s Religiousness A.\n\nIn short, Kierkegaard theoretically developed but did not describe Religiousness A, and Unamuno described but did not theoretically develop Quixotism. Given this state of affairs, my dissertation has two main goals: 1) to argue for the value of Religiousness A on the basis that it is a robust and attractive way of life that combines the passionate elements of Kierkegaard\u2019s Christianity with the communally committed aspects of Kierkegaard\u2019s ethics, and 2) to develop Unamuno\u2019s Quixotism as a working model of Religiousness A in order to give flesh to the ways in which Religiousness A is neither ethics nor Christianity.\n\nMy dissertation is comprised of four chapters: in the first, I give an overview of Kierkegaard\u2019s ethics, concluding that in his pseudonymous works there is not just one but two portraits of ethics. This will be useful for assessing which portrait of religion presented in the next chapter is compatible with ethics. In chapter two I revive Religiousness A as it is described by Johannes Climacus in Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846). After analyzing the other versions of religion that Kierkegaard provides (which I consider to be undesirable and unlivable), I make the case for the recovery of Religiousness A on the grounds that it is an ethical religion, but it is also a passionate religion. In chapter three I turn to Unamuno, whose descriptions of Quixotism in Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho (1905), Tragic Sense of Life (1913), and Manual de Quijotismo (1924-1931) are vivid if not theoretical, and I combine and analyze them in order to develop Quixotism as a robust religion instead of as a mere portrait. In chapter four I combine the language of Kierkegaard and Unamuno to show how Quixotism can be read as a concrete example of Religiousness A. \n\nUltimately, I conclude that Kierkegaard\u2019s Religiousness A, incarnated as it is in Unamuno\u2019s Quixotism, is a desirable way of life, because it combines passion with commitment and community. In short, Unamuno\u2019s underdeveloped Quixotism could be read as a prime example of Kierkegaard\u2019s undervalued Religiousness A, and as such it can help us understand Religiousness A, which both points out the philosophical distinctions between ethics and religion, and still provides a vision of how they might be peacefully united.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3920], "author_name_tesi": "Alessandri, Mary  Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Alessandri", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Mary ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Shannon Sullivan", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Daniel Joseph Conway", "John Philip Christman", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina", "Brady Lee Bowman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Shannon Sullivan, Dissertation Advisor", "Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Chair", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Nicolas L Fernandez Medina, Committee Member", "Brady Lee Bowman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Unamuno", "Kierkegaard"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CONTROLS ON GROUNDWATER CHEMISTRY IN THE CAPE COD\nAQUIFER, MASSACHUSETTS: THE IMPACT OF ACCESSORY MINERAL\nPHASES ON SOLUTE CONCENTRATIONS, 87Sr/86Sr, AND RARE EARTH\nELEMENT DISTRIBUTIONS\n\n\n", "id": "9377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "829", "abstract_tesi": "To quantify mineral dissolution and relative reaction rates in a mineralogically simple aquifer, we examined controls on solute concentrations, strontium isotopes, and rare earth element and ytrrium (REY) behavior within the Cape Cod aquifer, Massachusetts. The aquifer is dominated by carbonate-free Pleistocene glacial sediment and is primarily comprised of quartz (~90% wt.) and feldspar (5%), with plagioclase being the most abundant phase within the feldspar fraction (plagioclase/K-feldspar ~1.5). The remaining aquifer sediment consists of accessory mineral phases which are dominated by authigenic glauconite and Fe-oxides. Silica concentrations and pH increase systematically with depth within the aquifer while Sr isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) systematically decrease. Sr concentrations and 87Sr/86Sr are not well correlated, and groundwater 87Sr/86Sr values are consistently lower than 87Sr/86Sr of the bulk aquifer sediment or the 87Sr/86Sr of a K-feldspar component separated from the bulk aquifer sediment. The Sr isotope ratios of the groundwater are similar to a plagioclase-rich separate obtained from the bulk aquifer sediment, and Si-87Sr/86Sr-depth relationships are consistent with the dissolution of accessory plagioclase. Potassium-Sr-87Sr/86Sr relationships indicate dissolution of a K-rich aquifer component in addition to plagioclase, which is inferred to be glauconite. Though rich in Rb, authigenic glauconite contains Sr with relatively low 87Sr/8bSr due to the young Pleistocene age of the aquifer sediments, and will have a Sr isotopic signature reflecting geologically modern seawater. The impact of glauconite on solute behavior as a function of depth is expected to be non-uniform due to its variable abundance in the aquifer sediments. REY concentration trends as a function of depth in the Cape Cod groundwater are similar to K and Rb, but differ from those of Sr and Ca. REY patterns (shale-normalized) in the groundwater are light rare earth element (LREE) depleted, and contain negative Ce anomalies and positive Y anomalies (and super-chondritic Y/Ho ratios). No positive Eu anomalies that would be consistent with feldspar dissolution are observed in the groundwater REY patterns. REY behavior in the groundwater is therefore controlled by a Rb-K-rich phase, inferred to be glauconite. Interpretation of groundwater chemistry within the Cape Cod aquifer is heavily influenced by the impact of relatively minor aqui-fer components such as glauconite, and indicates that even within this relatively simple aquifer, only careful consideration of solute behavior from multiple sources fully characterizes mineral-water interactions.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [822], "author_name_tesi": "Alexander, Brian W.", "last_name_ssi": "Alexander", "middle_name_ssi": "W.", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Thesis Advisor", "Susan Louise Brantley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["rare earth elements", "groundwater", "Cape Cod", "strontium isotopes"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Wind Speed Prediction Via Time Series Modeling\n", "id": "10024", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1459", "abstract_tesi": "Projected construction of nearby wind farms motivates this study of statistical forecasting of wind speed, for which accurate prediction is critically important to the fluid integration of wind power into the electricity grid and energy market.

The prevalence of antigorite, its ability to buffer against acidic conditions from the dissociation of carbonic acid, and the resultant extraction of magnesium show promise as an underlying strategy for the production of magnesium carbonates without the consumption of additional reagents.  This process circumvents several challenges that are associated with the use of strongly acidic media, but is limited by the rate and extent of dissolution.  A parametric study on the effects of CO2 partial pressure, particle size, reactor temperature, and solids concentration has been conducted to evaluate the extraction of magnesium.\n\tThe presence of accessible and large-scale deposits of magnesium silicates owes to the recalcitrant nature of these minerals.  As the dissolution of silicate minerals is critical to an ex situ mineral carbonation process, the quantification and characterization of this reaction is important.  In this study, the evolution of the solution pH and release of magnesium from different particle size fractions of antigorite in the presence of carbonic acid provide insight into the potential for a large-scale, direct ex situ mineral carbonation process.  Carbonic acid is shown to be capable of disrupting magnesium-oxygen bonds at reactive sites that were generated during the grinding process.  However, the proportion and reactivity of these sites may be incapable of sustaining a dissolution rate that is commensurate with the scale of CO2 production for a coal-fired power plant without further technological advances.  In addition to the challenges associated with magnesium silicate dissolution, the carbonation of magnesium ions once in solution is not trivial.\n\tThe potential for the precipitation of magnesium carbonates was evaluated for a series of experiments that varied the partial pressure of CO2, particle size, reactor temperature, and solids concentration.  This range of experimental conditions results in only modest improvements in the activity of magnesium in solution.  However, these conditions lead to a range of bicarbonate activities that spans three orders of magnitude.  Geochemical modeling indicates a high degree of supersaturation with respect to magnesite, although no precipitates have been observed.  Kinetic limitations within the Mg-H2O-CO2 system favor the formation of the metastable magnesium carbonates hydromagnesite, Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2\u20224H2O, and nesquehonite, MgCO3\u20223H2O, under these reaction conditions.  The saturation indexes for these phases indicate that the solutions in this study are likely undersaturated with respect to hydromagnesite and nesquehonite.  The precipitation of magnesium carbonates can be facilitated by mitigating the strong Mg2+-H2O interactions.  An initial investigation into the effects of methanol and monoethylene glycol indicates that the solubility of hydromagnesite and magnesite could be reduced without the consumption of additional reagents.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7698], "author_name_tesi": "Alexander, George Wilbur", "last_name_ssi": "Alexander", "middle_name_ssi": "Wilbur", "first_name_ssi": "George", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Sharon Falcone Miller", "Tanya Furman", "Mark Stephen Klima"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Dissertation Advisor", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "Sharon Falcone Miller, Committee Member", "Tanya Furman, Committee Member", "Mark Stephen Klima, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mineral Carbonation", "Antigorite", "Dissolution", "Sequestration", "CO2 Storage"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "FROM WHERE AND FROM WHOM?

This includes the use of \u201ctop-down\u201d modeling approaches that have revealed many of the dominant large-scale controls on water generation and transport.  Although informative, further advancements are needed to improve the sensitivity of these models to the range of processes that control streamflow across multiple spatial scales.  These include improved methods for quantifying spatial and temporal variability in the parameters and uncertainties of hydrological models, which are needed to enhance the predictive capabilities of hydrological models in ungauged watersheds. \n\nTo address these needs, hierarchical Bayesian techniques were used with the spatially explicit source-transport model SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) to predict mean annual streamflow in streams in the continental United States and mean seasonal streamflow in the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB).  The models greatly expanded the spatial and temporal range of climate and watershed conditions for assessing the use of hierarchical methods in hydrological modeling.  Hierarchical techniques were used to estimate streamflows according to a multi-level model in which a multivariate model of the parameters was nested within a model of the streamflow observations.  Using a separate parameter model had the advantage of allowing model coefficients and the model error variance to vary regionally or seasonally, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the model to process controls that operate over these spatial and temporal scales.  This was enabled by Bayesian simulation of the hierarchical parameters, which allowed the parameters to be described as random variables with a probabilistic joint distribution of likely values that may vary over space and time, rather than being constrained to fixed but unknown quantities as is typical of non-Bayesian optimization methods.  Both the hierarchical and Bayesian features promote the notion of data sharing or information \u201cborrowing\u201d, in which the Bayesian model parameters represent a weighted combination of the parameters from two extreme conceptual modeling approaches:  one reflects the use of unique watershed-specific models, whereas the other reflects the use of a single universal multi-watershed model.  The former conceptual model is sensitive to unique local hydrology, whereas the latter describes global hydrological relations that are shared across all watersheds.  Statistical advantages arise from integrating these two approaches in cases where the local models suffer from less precise, data-poor information, given that the global model is likely to be informed by more statistically precise (but perhaps locally biased), data-rich information for a large collection of watersheds.\n\nIn addition, a more complex hierarchical state-space Bayesian model was used to unravel the sources of error that are responsible for prediction uncertainties, based on a simultaneous accounting of uncertainties in streamflow observations, parameters, and structural components of the model.  Accordingly, a model equation was specified for the streamflow observations and their uncertainties (i.e., \u201cmeasurement errors\u201d), within which a second equation was nested that described the deterministic structure of the model, including the river network, explanatory variables and associated coefficients, and a process-related variability component (\u201cprocess uncertainties\u201d).  The process uncertainties quantify process-related variations in streamflow that are unexplained by the measurement errors and the structural representation of physical processes in the model.  The process uncertainties may include random and systematic variations in hydrological processes, such as space/time biases, heteroscedasticity, nonstationarities, and spatial or temporal correlation. The measurement errors are expected to primarily reflect model uncertainties primarily associated with the measurement of streamflow (e.g., water velocity, rating curve stability).  However, measurement errors are potentially sensitive to inaccuracies in locating monitoring sites on reach segments or localized influences on flow (e.g., diversions, gaining/losing streams) that are not recognized by the deterministic model structure and not accounted for in the downstream observations of flow within the hydrologically nested array of monitoring sites.  Separation of the sources of uncertainties was facilitated by the spatial propagation of the process uncertainties (and exclusion of the measurement errors) during the model accumulation of water volumes from individual catchments within the river network.  The process uncertainties and measurement errors are specified so that they vary over space and time and quantify uncertainties associated with the smallest observational units in the model\u2014i.e., seasons and incremental drainage areas between monitoring sites (interquartile range of 475 to 3,225 km2 for the national model and 183 to 1,075 km2 for the SRB model).  The state-space model led to improved model accuracy and interpretability and revealed information about the potential causes of model uncertainties.  Predictions of streamflow, updated to include the state-space estimates of the process uncertainties, were designed to provide an improved measure of the latent \u201ctrue\u201d streamflows, which was tested in model comparisons that were conducted for a set of validation monitoring sites.\n \nThe application of hierarchical Bayesian methods to the SPARROW model in this study addressed three questions:  (1) What are the natural and cultural factors that control spatial and temporal variability in mean annual streamflow in watersheds of the United States and mean seasonal streamflow in the SRB?  (2) Is there evidence for hierarchical (multilevel) effects in the SPARROW streamflow models over large spatial scales?  (3) What are the effects on model accuracy and process understanding of using a more precise characterization of the streamflow model uncertainties, based on hierarchical Bayesian state-space methods?\n\nIn relation to the first question, the SPARROW model was sequentially coupled with a conceptual monthly water-balance model of the \u201cnatural\u201d effects of water supply and demand on unit-area runoff.  Mean-annual and mean-seasonal streamflow were estimated a function of aggregate-monthly inputs of unit-runoff, mediated by additional natural and anthropogenic properties that control water availability, demand, and transport.  The coupled models markedly improved prediction accuracy and identified additional climatic, terrestrial, and aquatic (reservoir, stream channel) controls on spatial and temporal variability in streamflow.  One unique finding is that water losses in streams, expressed as a fraction of the water volume per day of water travel time, were estimated to be larger in small streams and in western regions; the losses may stem from a combination of processes, including direct evaporation from water surfaces, recharge to the subsurface (especially in western streams), consumptive loss from diversions, and transpiration from riparian vegetation.\n\nIn relation to the second question, accounting for spatial and temporal variability in model coefficients and model error variance improved prediction accuracy and enhanced understanding of the scale-dependence and potential causes of model uncertainties.  The national model was found to display generally modest regional variability in coefficients; however, accounting for regional and drainage size-related variations in model uncertainties, which were positively correlated with the extent of aridity in the watersheds, resulted in large improvements in prediction accuracy in eastern watersheds.  In the SRB model, accounting for intra- and inter-annual variability in the unit-runoff coefficients led to larger improvements in prediction accuracy than the addition of spatial variability in other model coefficients.  This more temporally complex model led to larger improvements in accuracy in streamflow predictions during the more extreme water supply and demand conditions in the spring and summer seasons and especially during wet and dry years.\n\nAs to the last question, the state-space methods led primarily to improved characterizations of the process-related model and prediction uncertainties, with generally more modest effects observed on the values of the model coefficients and their levels of precision.  Several key patterns emerged in the process uncertainties and measurement errors.  First, process uncertainties were estimated to be larger than the measurement errors, owing to the relatively small sampling and analytical errors that were expected to be associated with the streamflow observations.  Second, the measurement errors and process uncertainties displayed similar regional patterns in the national model, with larger values in the more arid western regions.  Third, the larger process uncertainties in the state-space models suggest that the uncertainties associated with the more conventional (non-state-space) SPARROW streamflow model were generally underestimated.  Finally, evaluations at validation sites in the SRB confirmed the markedly improved accuracy of the state-space seasonal streamflow predictions; these predictions were updated to include the estimates of process uncertainties, which displayed a strong spatial covariance structure.  The gains in accuracy were larger during summer seasons when the dominant effects of groundwater inflows and transpiration losses are likely to cause a stronger spatial correlation structure in the process uncertainties.  Gains in accuracy were smaller during spring seasons when a diversity of hydrological processes can occur, including snow melt events and periods when soil and sub-surface water storage is reduced by evapotranspiration.  By contrast, predictions from the national state-space model at validation sites showed only limited gains in accuracy in a few western regions, suggesting that the process uncertainties in mean annual streamflows are spatially heterogeneous and lack a detectable spatial covariance structure in most regions.  The larger size of these drainages in the national model may have contributed to this pattern.  This stresses the possible importance of using more spatially resolved river networks (as used in the SRB) and larger numbers of historical daily monitoring stations in future hierarchical modeling studies.\n\nThe results of the study advance hydrological understanding by providing important insights about major process controls on streamflow variability in predominantly developed and climatically diverse watersheds.  The evaluations of the hierarchical Bayesian methods demonstrated their effectiveness for enhancing model sensitivity to hydrological processes that operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales.  This included the use of spatially and temporally varying model parameters that identified regional and seasonal/annual uniformities in hydrological responses to major controlling factors, including climate, land use, and stream channel processes.  The evaluations also identified methods for unraveling the sources of model uncertainties that revealed process-related information on the seasonal spatial-correlation structure in streamflows; explicitly accounting for this structure markedly improved prediction accuracy at monitoring sites used to validate the model. These techniques can be used to enhance the performance of other statistical and mechanistic hydrological models.  They can also advance methods for quantifying hydrological similarities among neighboring watersheds, which are needed to reliably transfer hydrological data and models to ungauged catchments (e.g., classification techniques).  The continued development of the model specifications from this study has the potential to contribute to further advances.  These potentially include the simultaneous modeling of surface and base flow in streams and the addition of functional specifications of the process uncertainties to explicitly account for aridity-related spatial variability and spatial and temporal covariances in streamflows. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11378], "author_name_tesi": "Alexander, Richard Brown", "last_name_ssi": "Alexander", "middle_name_ssi": "Brown", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "David Russell Dewalle", "Christopher J Duffy", "Tyler Wagner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Dissertation Advisor", "David Russell Dewalle, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Tyler Wagner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrology", "watershed modeling", "Bayesian statistics", "streamflow", "SPARROW modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "REFLEX CUTANEOUS VASODILATION:  INFLUENCES OF PRIMARY HUMAN AGING AND HYPERTENSIVE VASCULAR PATHOLOGY\n\n\n", "id": "7499", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3805", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reflex cutaneous vasodilation is attenuated with primary human aging and hypertensive vascular pathology, rendering these populations more vulnerable to complications from heat-related illness.  Full expression of reflex cutaneous vasodilation is dependent on functional nitric oxide (NO), which is reduced with primary human aging and hypertensive vascular pathology. NO bioavailability may be decreased by (1) upregulated arginase (Arg) activity, which reciprocally regulates the NO-synthase (NOS) substrate L-arginine (L-arg) and/or (2) increased oxidant stress.  Furthermore, there may be a mechanistic link between upregulated Arg activity and increased oxidant stress through NOS uncoupling.  Therefore, the purpose of this series of experiments was to investigate the underlying mechanisms mediating impaired reflex cutaneous vasodilation in aged and hypertensive cutaneous vasculature.  \nIn the first study we investigated age-related alterations in exogenous acetylcholine-induced vasodilation.  While acetylcholine is capable of modulating reflex-mediated vasodilation, the precise mechanisms through which acetylcholine induces vasodilation and whether those downstream mechanisms change with aging are unclear. We tested the hypotheses that both NO- and prostanoid-mediated pathways contribute to exogenous acetylcholine-induced vasodilation and that both are attenuated with advanced age. Twelve young (Y:  23\u201eb1 yr) and 10 older (O:  69\u201eb1 yr) subjects underwent infusions of 137.5 \u00a3gM acetycholine at 4 intradermal microdialysis (MD) sites: control (Co, Ringer\u00a1\u00a6s), NO synthase inhibited (NOS-I, 10 mM L-NAME), cyclooxygenase inhibited (COX-I, 10 mM ketorolac) and NOS-I+COX-I.  For all studies red blood cell flux was monitored using laser-Doppler flowmetry and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC) was calculated (laser-Doppler flux/MAP) and normalized to maximal CVC (%CVCmax) (28mM sodium nitroprusside + local heating to 43\u201eaC).  Baseline %CVCmax was increased in the older at COX-I sites (COX-I 16\u00a1\u00d31, NOS-I+COX-I 16\u00a1\u00d32 vs. Co 10\u00a1\u00d31 %CVCmax; p<0.001) but not in the young, suggesting an age-related shift toward COX-derived vasoconstrictors contributing to basal cutaneous vasomotor tone.  There was no difference in peak %CVCmax during acetylcholine infusion between age groups and the response was unchanged by NOS-I (O:  NOSI 35\u00a1\u00d35 vs. Co 38\u00a1\u00d35 %CVCmax; p=0.84) (Y:  NOSI 41\u00a1\u00d34 vs. Co 39\u00a1\u00d34 %CVCmax; p=0.67).  COX-I and NOS-I+COX-I attenuated the peak CVC response to Ach in both groups (COX-I Y:  22\u00a1\u00d32 vs. O:  29\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax vs. Co; p<0.001 both groups; NOS-I+COX-I Y:  29\u00a1\u00d32 vs. O:  32\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax vs. Co; p<0.001 both groups).  We concluded that acetylcholine directly induces cutaneous vasodilation through prostanoid and non-NO-, non-prostanoid-dependent pathways.  Further, older subjects have a diminished prostanoid contribution to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation.\nIn the second study we hypothesized that increased Arg activity contributes to attenuated vasodilation in aged skin by limiting L-arg for NOS-mediated NO synthesis.  Five MD fibers were placed in forearm skin of 10 young (Y:  23\u00a1\u00d31 years) and 9 older (O:  68\u00a1\u00d31 years) human subjects serving as Co, NOS-I, Arg-inhibited (Arg-I:  5.0mM (S)-(2-boronoethyl)-L-cysteine + 5.0mM N-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine), L-arg supplemented (L-arg:  10.0mM L-arginine) and combined Arg-inhibited + L-arg sites. For all whole body heating studies reflex vasodilation was induced by using a water-perfused suit to increase oral temperature (Tor) 0.8-1.0\u00a2XC.  Cutaneous vasodilation during heating was attenuated in the older subjects (Y:  42\u00a1\u00d31 vs. O:  30\u00a1\u00d31 %CVCmax, p<0.001) at Co sites.  NOS inhibition decreased vasodilation in both age groups compared to Co (Y:  22\u00a1\u00d32, O: 18\u00a1\u00d32 %CVCmax, p<0.001).  Arg inhibition, L-arg supplementation, and Arg inhibition + L-arg supplementation augmented vasodilation in the older subjects (Arg-inhibited:  46\u00a1\u00d34, L-arg:  44\u00a1\u00d34, Arg-inhibited + L-arg:  46\u00a1\u00d35 %CVCmax, p<0.001 vs. Co) but not in young subjects (Arg-inhibited:  46\u00a1\u00d34, L-arg:  38\u00a1\u00d34, Arg-inhibited + L-arg:  44\u00a1\u00d34 %CVCmax, p>0.05 vs. Co).  Increasing L-arg for NO synthesis by either Arg inhibition or direct L-arg supplementation abolishes the age-related deficit in reflex cutaneous vasodilation.  \nThe third study tested the hypothesis that age-related increases in oxidant stress attenuates reflex cutaneous vasodilation, therefore acute antioxidant administration alone and combined with Arg inhibition to increase L-arginine availability would increase reflex cutaneous vasodilation in aged skin.  Eleven young (Y, 22\u00a1\u00d31 years) and 10 older (O, 68\u00a1\u00d31 years) men and women were instrumented with four intradermal MD fibers.  MD sites served as Co, NOS-I, L-ascorbate supplemented (Asc:  10mM L-ascorbate), and Asc + Arg-inhibited (AA+Arg-I: 10mM L-ascorbate + 5mM BEC + 5mM nor-NOHA).  Cutaneous vasodilation during heating was attenuated in the older subjects (Y:  37\u00a1\u00d33 vs. O:  28\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax, p<0.05).  NOS-I significantly decreased vasodilation in both groups compared to the Co site (Y:  20\u00a1\u00d34, O: 15\u00a1\u00d32 %CVCmax, p<0.05 vs. Co within group).  Asc and Asc + Arg-I did increase vasodilation beyond Co in the older subjects (Asc:  35\u00a1\u00d34 %CVCmax, Asc + Arg-I:   41\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax; p<0.001) but did not in the young subjects (Asc:  36\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax ; Asc + Arg-I:   40\u00a1\u00d35 %CVCmax, p>0.05 ).  Combined Asc + Arg-I resulted in a greater increase in vasodilation than did Asc alone in the older subjects (p=0.001).  Acute Asc supplementation increased reflex cutaneous vasodilation in aged skin. When combined with Arg inhibition to increase L-arg availability Asc supplementation resulted in a further increase in vasodilation above Asc alone, effectively restoring cutaneous vascular conductance to the level of young subjects. \nIn the fourth study we tested the hypothesized that NO-dependent vasodilation would be attenuated in essential hypertensive human skin due to upregulated Arg activity and acute Arg inhibition or L-arg supplementation would augment reflex cutaneous vasodilation. Five MD fibres were placed in skin of 8 unmedicated subjects with essential hypertension (HTN:  MAP: 112\u00a1\u00d31 mmHg) and 9 age-matched normotensive (AMN) (MAP: 87\u00a1\u00d31 mmHg) men and women to serve as: Co, NOS-I, Arg-I, L-arg supplemented, and combined Arg-I + L-arg.  The \u00a3G%CVCmax between the Co and NOS-I site was calculated as the difference between Co and NOS-I sites. Maximal CVC was attenuated in the HTN subjects by ~25% compared to AMN subjects (p<0.001).  With a 1.0\u00a2XC increase in body core temperature (Tor) %CVCmax was not different between the groups (HTN:  43\u00a1\u00d33 vs. AMN:  45\u00a1\u00d33%CVCmax, p>0.05).  NOS-I significantly decreased %CVCmax in both groups but %CVCmax was greater in the HTN group (HTN:  32\u00a1\u00d34 vs. AMN:  23\u00a1\u00d33%CVCmax, p<0.05).  Arg-I alone augmented %CVCmax only in the HTN group (HTN:  65\u00a1\u00d35 vs. AMN:  48\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax, p<0.05).  L-arg alone did not effect %CVCmax in either group (HTN:  49\u00a1\u00d35 vs. AMN:  49\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax, p>0.05).  Combined Arg-I + L-arg augmented %CVCmax in both subject groups compared to their respective control sites (HTN:  60\u00a1\u00d37 vs. AMN:  61\u00a1\u00d33 %CVCmax, both p<0.05 vs. respective control sites). The \u00a3G %CVCmax between the control and NOS-I sites was attenuated at \u00a3GTor>0.5\u00a2XC in the HTN group (p<0.001 vs. AMN). Vasodilation is attenuated with HTN due to decreased NO-dependent vasodilation and can be augmented with Arg inhibition but not L-arg supplementation, suggesting that Arg is upregulated with HTN.  \nIn the fifth study we tested the hypothesis that increased oxidant stress contributed to attenuated NO-dependent reflex cutaneous vasodilation in hypertensive human subjects, further antioxidant supplementation, alone and combined with Arg inhibition would augment NO-dependent cutaneous vasodilation.  Nine unmedicated subjects with essential hypertension (HTN:  MAP=112\u00a1\u00d31mmHg) and 9 age-matched normotensive (AMN:  MAP=81\u00a1\u00d310) men and women were instrumented with 4 intradermal microdialysis (MD) fibers: Co, NOS-I, Asc supplemented, and Asc + Arg-I.

A great number of such devices have\nbeen manufactured over the last few decades using surface and bulk\nsilicon micro-machining. Many of micro-electro-mechanical systems\n(MEMS) involve gaseous flows. Gas flows in MEMS with characteristic\nsize on the order of microns differ  from their larger\ncounterparts. Three important flow parameters: Knudsen and Reynolds\nnumbers and surface-to-volume ratio, are drastically different from\nthose encountered in large scale flows. Accurate numerical modeling of\nmicroflows is indispensable for providing design capability for MEMS\nby predicting the flow field and performance characteristics. The main\ngoal of the thesis research is the development, implementation and\napplication of comprehensive direct simulation Monte Carlo approach to\nmicroscale gas flows.\n\n\nFlows in microthrusters and microchannels are commonly encountered in\nMEMS and are the focus of the study. The investigation of physical\nprocesses in three-dimensional micronozzles and the influence of\nReynolds number, geometrical configuration and temperature regime have\nbeen carried out in the thesis. The impact of wall effects on thrust\nis examined for axisymmetric and two- and three-dimensional cold gas\nmicronozzles. The flow in a flat micronozzle has a 3D structure and is\nstrongly influenced by the end walls. The additional friction losses\non the side walls cause a reduction in thrust of about 20\\% compared\nto the two-dimensional and axisymmetric nozzles.\n\n\nThe work on coupled analysis of a microthruster is aimed at the\ndeveloping a numerical simulation code capable of modeling the\ntemporal variation of microthruster material temperature and\nperformance characteristics. The application of the developed approach\nto two-dimensional and three-dimensional microthrusters gives several\nimportant insights into the dependence of performance characteristics\non Reynolds number, thermal conditions and thruster geometry. The mass\ndischarge of the microthruster have been found to decrease\nsignificantly in time due to increasing wall temperature.

A network designed on sound engineering principles helps to maximize the deliverability from the wells with minimum energy loss during transportation. To achieve this objective, pipeline network models help in characterizing the system to understand the behavior of the network under different operating conditions. In this study, a one dimensional steady state isothermal integrated network model was developed by combining reservoir with surface facility description parameters to effectively capture the variations in flow dynamics with changes in network conditions. In this study, the typical constant supply specification of network analysis was relaxed by implementing gas well deliverability equations at all supply nodes in the system. This model is an extension of the general pipeline network model where the deliverability from the wells are predicted in addition to the nodal pressures in the system based on a set of operating conditions. The model was history matched to the production data from a gas gathering and production system located in Snow Show, Pennsylvania by adjusting the performance constant of the well for a predetermined unique well shut in pressure. With this basic deliverability model in hand, the network was evaluated for several if-then scenarios related to proposed captive modifications to be carried out to analyze the pressure and deliverability changes in the system. Based on the model predictions, recommendations were made to the operator in terms of total production, total sales and fuel consumed by the compressors present in the network. This integrated modeling approach helped in analyzing the system response as a whole and gave a good insight of how the well shut in pressures used in the model had a significant impact on the deliverability predictions.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1622], "author_name_tesi": "Alexis, Dennis Arun ", "last_name_ssi": "Alexis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dennis Arun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H", "Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["deliverability", "IPR", "gas networks", "integrated model"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of Fluid Transport Properties of Coal Bed Methane Reservoirs", "id": "19091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8941", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Determination of petro-physical properties of coal bed methane (CBM) reservoirs is essential in evaluating a potential prospect for commercial exploitation. In particular, permeability is the most significant rock property controlling the transport of natural gas to the wellbore. Specifically, relative permeability of coal to gas and water in the fracture network determines the ease with which immiscible fluids travel through the reservoir in the presence of each other and directly impacts the amount of hydrocarbons that can be ultimately recovered. Due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of coal seams, proper relative permeability relationships are needed to accurately describe the transport characteristics of coal for reservoir modeling and production forecasting. In this work, absolute and relative permeability of different coal samples were determined experimentally under steady-state flowing conditions. Multiphase flow tests were conducted using brine, helium and carbon dioxide as the flowing phases under different magnitudes of confining and pore pressures.  Results indicate that effective stress (Confining pressure \u2013 average pore pressure) has a significant effect on both absolute and relative permeability of coal. With increases in effective stresses, the absolute permeability decreases. Effective permeability and relative permeability, as well as the cross over point and the width of the mobile two-phase region decrease as the effective stress increases. In addition, the mobile range of gas and water in the coal samples investigated corresponds with water saturations above 50%, irrespective of the base absolute permeability of the sample. In brine-carbon dioxide two-phase flow experiments, the effect of carbon dioxide adsorption was observed as effective permeabilities measured decreased in comparison to the helium-brine permeabilities at the same flowing ratios.  Gas transport is restricted in the presence of water as significant water occupation is observed in the fracture network during the two phase flow tests and also evident from the magnitude of the effective and relative permeabilities. As a result, relative permeability \n\ncharacteristics of CBM systems were found to be insufficiently represented as sole functions of fluid saturation.  In addition, laboratory measurements were used to conduct field scale simulations of primary recovery from CBM systems using variable, stress-dependent relative permeabilities. Simulation results show that methane recovery from CBM reservoirs can be overestimated when dynamic changes in relative permeability relationships are ignored. A multi-dimensional correlation between relative permeability, fluid saturation and specific surface area of the cleat network is proposed as a continuation from this work in order to account for stress-related changes in cleat network connectivity.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8780], "author_name_tesi": "Alexis, Dennis Arun ", "last_name_ssi": "Alexis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dennis Arun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Turgay Ertekin", "Yilin Wang", "Derek Elsworth", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coal bed methane", "permeability", "relative permeability", "effective stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays on productivity and sectoral differences", "id": "14031", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7243", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation uses sectoral data in production and patents to provide explanations for previous findings and improves the measurement of technology diffusion and productivity differences across countries.   Chapters 1 and 2 deal with measuring technology diffusion.  In Chapter 1 I document stylized facts regarding technology diffusion across pairs of countries in different types of goods. I focus primarily on the composition of the patents that are requested by researchers from one country in any given destination. In the data, for a given origin, some types of ideas are more likely to be patented in richer, more technologically advanced countries, while other types of ideas are more likely to be patented in poorer, less advanced destinations.  In chapter 2 I tackle the challenge of measuring international technology diffusion by proposing a model that allows for more precise estimation of bilateral diffusion rates between countries compared to previous literature using the data presented in Chapter 1. Due to the abstract nature of technology and, consequently, the limited amount of data that can be used this has been a particularly difficult task. In most cases it has been possible to measure how foreign research affects a country's productivity or even how good one country is at importing or exporting knowledge from abroad. Nevertheless, measurement of how much each partner contributes to the technological development of each country has not been performed successfully. My approach is to generalize an Eaton-Kortum model for diffusion of ideas to match empirical facts regarding patent data.   In the model proposed the heterogeneity in the predicted data arises from the relative\ndifferences in technological progress of the pair of countries involved. I argue that this extension contributes to measuring international technology diffusion more precisely. This is possible since the generalization of the model requires the introduction of a few parameters, while allowing for a much larger data set to be used in the estimation.\n\nChapter 3 deals with a productivity question.  Traditionally, variance decomposition exercises across countries result in total factor productivity (TFP) accounting for about two thirds of the variance in GDP per capita. In most cases a country is modeled as a one-sector economy. Recent work by Ferreira et al. (2008) that applies this methodology to 31 years of data shows that this result does not hold in the early seventies: disparities in physical and human capital were more relevant in explaining income differences. I expand the model to include agriculture, a sector assumed to be different in terms of the production function where land in particular plays an important role. I show that ignoring the existence of this sector can cause the importance of TFP to be overestimated due to the productivity of land being implicitly assigned to it, and that this overestimation fades away as the share of agriculture in production decreases. I show that part of the increase in the importance of TFP in explaining the variance of GDP per capita can be explained by the structural transformation that most economies have experienced recently, especially poorer ones.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7226], "author_name_tesi": "Alfaro Urena, Alonso ", "last_name_ssi": "Alfaro Urena", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alonso", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andres Rodriguez Clare", "Andres Rodriguez Clare", "Alexander Monge Naranjo", "Stephen Ross Yeaple", "Edward C Jaenicke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andres Rodriguez Clare, Dissertation Advisor", "Andres Rodriguez Clare, Committee Chair", "Alexander Monge Naranjo, Committee Member", "Stephen Ross Yeaple, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["productivity", "patents", "international technology diffusion", "neoclassical production function", "eaton kortum model"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Development and Testing of Artificial Neural Network Based Models for Water Flooding and Polymer Gel Flooding in Naturally Fractured Reservoirs", "id": "26572", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11732", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increasing demand for energy and accelerated consumption of hydrocarbon fuel have made it a necessary objective for the oil and gas industry to continuously search for ways to improve and maximize recovery from oil reservoirs, to meet this growing global demand. Water flooding is one of the most common secondary recovery practices used in the petroleum industry to maintain reservoir pressure and improve oil displacement efficiency and recovery. Nonetheless, water flooding could pose several production problems in certain types of naturally fractured reservoirs, jeopardizing the overall sweep efficiency and oil recovery in the field. The presence of these heterogeneous natural fracture systems highly influences and complicates fluid flow process in the reservoir\u2019s transport media. These fractures provide easy conduits and fluid pathways for the injected water, causing early premature water breakthrough, excessive water production and rapid decline of oil rate.\n\nThe implementation of polymer gel treatments is one of the viable solution commonly used in the industry to mitigate sweep conformance problems and improve oil recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs. Water-soluble polymer solutions are combined with cross-linking agents to form an in-situ gel that can be injected with water into the reservoir media. This polymer gel not only improves the overall mobility ratio of injected fluid, but also provides a mean to plug the conduit fractures and subsequently improving overall volumetric sweep efficiency and oil recovery from the reservoir matrix.\n\nReservoir simulators are commonly used to build reliable reservoir models for the purpose of history matching, production forecasting and evaluation of various design scenarios. Nonetheless, reservoir simulation can become very computationally demanding and time- consuming process. This problem could be overcome by the development of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models that could be used to generate various possible scenarios at a much\nefficient time pace compared to reservoir simulation.\n\nThe main objective of this research is to develop neuro-simulation proxy models for the\nimplementation of water flooding and polymer gel flooding in naturally fractured reservoirs. Three main ANN models, one forward and two inverses, were developed for each scenario, water flooding and polymer gel flooding.\n\nThe first ANN, Forward ANN, provides a forward solution to predict the production profiles of oil rate, water cut and recovery factor for a given set of reservoir and design data. Forward results were matched within a desired tolerance of l0%. The second ANN, Inverse ANN- 1, provides an inverse-looking solution to estimate the project design parameters required to produce a given production profile for a given set of reservoir properties. Five design parameters were investigated, including: reservoir\u2019s drainage area, injection rate, producer bottom-hole pressure, polymer concentration and cross linker concentration. The last ANN, Inverse ANN-2, can be used as a tool for history matching and estimation of reservoir properties given a production profile and project design parameters. The reservoir properties predicted by this model include: matrix and fracture porosity, matrix and fracture permeability, fracture spacing, reservoir thickness and initial water saturation. The results from inverse ANN models were produced with an average error of 5 to 10%, per design parameter, and an average error of 8 to 28%, per reservoir property.

It was found that, while the general sensibility in channeling a greenhouse gas such as methane to productive use was extremely logical, certain cautionary measures would have to be adopted to safeguard against possible negative side-effects.  The analysis was made solely on landfills that were devoted to municipal solid wastes; or at most, agricultural wastes.  Landfills with hazardous and toxic waste profiles were not considered.   An extensive literature review was conducted and the following was revealed that, \ni.\tIt was much better to recycle materials that either did not biodegrade easily or that,\nupon biodegradation, yielded toxic and other hazardous chemicals that threatened landfill sites with pollution. \nii.\t   It was also revealed that old landfill sites, even if they produced economically viable quantities of methane, must be adequately safeguarded against possible pollution from by-products of anaerobic fermentation; the principal process that generates methane.\niii.\tIt was also determined that new sites must strictly adhere to certain rules and regulations promulgated by local authorities.  It was believed that such adherence would ensure that the site accepted only safe waste that broke down into methane gas without complication from toxic and hazardous by-products.  Such adherence would also ensure that these future landfills would be adequately insulated against any manner of possible pollution of the environment via air, water and soil media. \niv.\tIt was also ascertained that methane produced at landfills should be monitored for toxic and harmful content and accordingly purified to ensure against pollution and damage in the course of utilization.  The gas must also be purified of inert components that tend to reduce thermal energy content. \nv.\tSmall landfills that were considered incapable of producing economically viable quantities of methane must be equipped with methanotrophic bacteria in well-aerated topsoil so that the methane produced in the underlayers would be broken down into harmless components.  \nvi.\tLastly, among certain models that could predict methane generation potentials of landfills with specific characteristics, the IPCC (International Panel for Climate Change) 2006, model was proposed as an international tool that could be used in countries where local models were unavailable as it had within its range of defaults that fitted many regions of the world.\nIn all, it is believed that an adequate generalized concept of landfill site safeguarding, collecting of gas, its purification, conveyance to utilities and utilization have been made available.  Very few quantitative parameters have been used as these were found too specific for the purpose of the thesis; but again, it is believed that the novelty of the proposed generalized concept adequately made up for the loss of any specificities as these later could be handled at the deployment stage.  It is noted though that all specificities that could be made to support the generalized concept, including the process via which anaerobic methanogenic microbials produced methane and the optimal conditions under which they did so, were adequately explored.  Methane as a major environmental pollutant can be channeled into productive usage after employment of a few cautionary measures that have been discussed.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5292], "author_name_tesi": "Alghni, Rayyan Saud", "last_name_ssi": "Alghni", "middle_name_ssi": "Saud", "first_name_ssi": "Rayyan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Christopher Ciocci", "Richard Christopher Ciocci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Christopher Ciocci, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Christopher Ciocci, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["methane gas", "environment", "renewable", "landfill"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Calibrated Energy Simulations Of Potential Energy \nsavings In Actual Retail Buildings\n", "id": "23682", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10755", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Retail stores are commercial buildings with high energy consumption due to their typically large volumes and long hours of operation. This dissertation assesses heating, ventilating and air conditioning saving strategies based on energy simulations with input parameters from actual retail buildings. The dissertation hypothesis is that \u201cRetail store buildings will save a significant amount of energy by (1) modifying ventilation rates, and/or (2) resetting set point temperatures. These strategies have shown to be beneficial in previous studies. As presented in the literature review, potential energy savings ranged from 0.5% to 30% without compromising indoor thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The retail store buildings can be ventilated at rates significantly lower than rates called for in the ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010 while maintaining acceptable indoor air quality. Therefore, two dissertation objectives are addressed: (1) Investigate opportunities to reduce ventilation rates that do not compromise indoor air quality in retail stores located in Central Pennsylvania, (2) Investigate opportunities to increase (in summer) and decrease (in winter) set point temperatures that do not compromise thermal comfort.\n          \t This study conducted experimental measurements of ventilation rates required to maintain acceptable air quality and indoor environmental conditions requirements for two retail stores using ASHRAE Standard 62.1_2012. More specifically, among other parameters, occupancy density, indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations, and indoor temperatures were measured continuously for one week interval. One of these retail stores were tested four times for a yearlong time period. Pollutants monitored were formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, particle size distributions and concentrations, as well as total volatile organic compounds.\n \t As a part of the base protocol, the number of occupants in each store was hourly counted during the test, and the results reveal that the occupant densities were approximately 20% to 30% of that called by ASHRAE 62.1. Formaldehyde was the most important contaminant of concern in retail stores investigated. Both stores exceeded the most conservative health guideline for formaldehyde (OEHHA TWA REL = 7.3 ppb). This study found that source removal and reducing the emission rate, as demonstrated in retail stores sampled in this study, is a viable strategy to meet the health guideline.\n        Total volatile compound were present in retail stores at low concentrations well below health guidelines suggested by Molhve (1700\u00b5g /m\u00b2) and Bridges (1000 \u00b5g /m\u00b2). Based on these results and through mass\u2013balance modeling, different ventilation rate reduction scenarios were proposed, and  for these scenarios the differences in energy consumption were estimated. Findings of all phases of this desertion have contributed to understanding (a) the trade-offs between energy savings and ventilation rates that do not compromise indoor air quality, and (b) the trade-offs between energy savings and resets of indoor air temperature that do not compromise thermal comfort. Two models for retail stores were built and validated against actual utility bills. Energy simulation results indicated that by lowering the ventilation rates from measured and minimum references would reduce natural gas energy use by estimated values of 6% to 19%. Also, this study found that the electrical cooling energy consumption was not significantly sensitive to different ventilation rates. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10377], "author_name_tesi": "Alhafi, Zuhaira ", "last_name_ssi": "Alhafi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zuhaira", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pr Jelena Srebric", "William P Bahnfleth", "Stephen James Treado", "Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pr Jelena Srebric, Dissertation Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Chair", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ventilation rate", "Indoor air quality", "Energy savings"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF USING COOPERATIVE LEARNING TO PROMOTE READING COMPREHENSION, VOCABULARY, AND FLUENCY ACHIEVEMENT SCORES OF MALE  FOURTH- AND FIFTH-GRADE STUDENTS IN A SAUDI ARABIAN SCHOOL\n\n\n", "id": "7011", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4344", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined the extent to which the use of cooperative learning in the Islamic Saudi Academy (ISA) in Washington, DC had an impact on the reading performance of grade four and five students in the standard reading curriculum.

Most jobs today require postsecondary education, forcing many high school students to enroll in a higher education institution in order to advance their careers. However, for most higher education graduates today, receiving a degree is not enough to ensure employment, especially in light of the current economic crisis. College students must have the right job skills to be successful in the workplace.\nAs a result, postsecondary institutions are required today to enhance their relationships with the labor market in order to ensure that their students are up-to-date on workforce needs and demands and able to engage in better careers. According to Cares (1999), \u201ceducation for tomorrow must be built of round, rigorous academic standards, industry skill standards, connecting to the privates sector, and ongoing career development\u201d (p. 1). Student success in their future career depends on their skills, from academic to technical competencies to more general job skills (U.S. Department of Labor, 1991). \nQualitative research studies on the relationship between schools and businesses are almost absent in the UAE, especially by those in postsecondary institutions. This study is significant not only in being one of the first to examine this relationship, but also because it is based on the contributions being made to the UAE workforce by the United Arab Emirates University career training program (Industrial Training Program) in the Department of Engineering. This study sought to examine the role of this career training program in preparing 4th-year senior students for future career jobs. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 students from different specialties in the Department of Engineering who were enrolled in the training program, and with five employer representatives who have worked with this department\u2019s students in recent years. This premise formed the basis of this research\u2014specifically, what is the perceived value of the career training program at the UAEU according to student participants and employers who are providing learning experiences to students?\nStudy participants revealed a positive impression toward the training program initiative (Industrial Training Program). They reported that the university career training program is an excellent program and will remain a major and vital program in preparing young graduates with the necessary skills for the workforce. However, study findings suggest that the current career training program requires several enhancements to its current offerings, including: business and university partnerships, placement strategy, annual analysis of labor market trends, and curricular improvements with regard to connecting school-based learning with work-based learning activities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3918], "author_name_tesi": "Alhawasin, Mohamed Abdalla", "last_name_ssi": "Alhawasin", "middle_name_ssi": "Abdalla", "first_name_ssi": "Mohamed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Walter", "Richard Allen Walter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Walter, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Allen Walter, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Characteristics of University Training Program"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Self-powered Thermoacoustic Sensor for In-pile Nuclear Reactor Monitoring\n", "id": "17539", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Inspired by the unfortunate events of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, 2011, the Pennsylvania State University began a collaboration with Idaho National Laboratories (INL) to embark upon the development of a self-powered sensor to monitor the temperature inside a nuclear reactor.

Through electromagnetic radiation, these high temperatures provide the power needed to generate the thermoacoustic oscillations in the device. These acoustic pressure oscillations will propagate throughout a nuclear reactor by sound radiation and its frequency\ncan be measured remotely, which is related to the temperature of the gas in the nuclear fuel rod. This temperature inferred from the frequency of the acoustic oscillation is an effective temperature of the nuclear fuel rod that the acoustic wave spatially averages across the length of the resonator. The interpretation of the thermoacoustic fuel rod resonance frequency as a representation of temperature will be also presented as a T-matrix approximation that properly weights the local sound speed in a resonator with a significant longitudinal temperature gradient. \n\nThe heat transfer within the device is also discussed, as acoustic streaming which is inherent to the thermoacoustically generated sound wave keeps the device in continuous operation. The streaming results in forced gas convection which removes heat from the ambient end of a stack and passes into the fluid surrounding the fuel rod. In conjunction with the electromagnetic radiation on the hot side of the stack, this eliminates the requirement for any hot or cold heat exchangers.

Disruption of both cholesterol and iron metabolism have been independently reported to contribute to several diseases including Alzheimer disease (AD) and cancer. AD is a debilitating disease characterized by progressive neuronal loss and memory impairment. Although the underlying cause(s) of AD are not completely understood, iron accumulation and the resultant oxidative stress are well established contributors to the development of AD. Normal iron uptake is mediated by HFE (high iron, also called hemochromatosis protein). H63D and C282Y are two common variants of the HFE protein that are implicated as disease modifying risk factors for AD and several cancers, respectively. The main objective of this thesis was to determine whether a relationship exists between iron and cholesterol metabolism that could be of relevance for understanding the underlying mechanism of diseases such as AD and cancer. This goal was achieved by studying the effect(s) on cholesterol metabolism of two specific variants of HFE (H63D and C282Y) known to affect iron metabolism. \nThe H63D variant of HFE, associated with dysregulation of iron homeostasis, has been implicated as a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE4), a known risk factor for AD, is associated with disruption of cholesterol metabolism. Recent studies showed that individuals with both the APOE4 allele and the H63D variant of HFE had a much greater risk and earlier onset of AD than individuals carrying either the APOE4 allele or H63D variant of HFE alone. Therefore, the hypothesis that H63D-HFE is associated with development of cognitive impairment by disrupting cholesterol metabolism thereby contributing to increased neurodegeneration, and increased memory deficits was investigated. The effect(s) of H63D-HFE on expression of cholesterol was studied using SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells transfected to stably express either wild type (WT-) or H63D-HFE. The ~50% reduction in  cholesterol content in cells expressing H63D-HFE was accompanied by a significant decrease in expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR), and a significant increase in expression of cholesterol hydroxylase (CYP46A1). Consistent with in vitro studies, H67D-HFE (homologous to human H63D-HFE) knock-in mice, showed a genotype and age dependent decline in brain cholesterol relative to WT-HFE controls and similar changes in expression of proteins regulating cholesterol metabolism. The reduction in cholesterol in brains of H67D-HFE mice was accompanied by a significant decrease in expression of synapse and myelin management proteins, significant increase in caspase-3 expression, and cortical and hippocampal neurodegeneration in the brains of 18 and 24 month old mice. Performance on learning and memory tasks (novel object recognition and Barnes maze) indicated that H67D-HFE mice had poorer cognitive function than WT-HFE mice. Magnetic resonance imaging of 24 month-old mice showed a greater reduction in the volume of brains in H67D-HFE mice. Combined these data indicate that the H63D/H67D variant contributes to the disease process in AD by altering cholesterol metabolism as well as that of iron and that these changes are accompanied by neuronal loss, brain atrophy, and memory impairment which are symptoms of AD. The results also provide a possible explanation for why expression of both APOE4 and H63D-HFE is associated with earlier onset of AD.\nDisruptions in the maintenance of iron and cholesterol metabolism have also been implicated in several cancers. Therefore, in the second part of this work, the effects of C282Y-HFE on lipid (cholesterol and sphingolipid) metabolism and its possible relevance to cancer phenotype was also studied. Expression of C282Y-HFE altered transcription of a number of enzymes involved in cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism.  More specifically it was associated with significant changes in the expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were consistent with significant elevation in total cholesterol content of C282Y-HFE cells. Of particular interest was the finding that expression of the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1(SphK) and its pro-survival metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was elevated. These effects may contribute to the increased risk of colorectal, breast, prostate, ovarian, and brain tumors reported for carriers of C282Y-HFE and explain why it is considered protective against Alzheimer\u2019s disease while H63D-HFE is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in the gene expression seen for proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, indicate that increased uptake of cholesterol is the likely cause for the elevation in cellular cholesterol content seen in C282Y-HFE expressing cells. Since simvastatin is an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and has been proposed to be beneficial for the treatment of certain cancers, its effect on the viability of C282Y-HFE cells was ascertained. A higher concentration of simvastatin was needed to decrease survival of cells expressing C282Y-HFE than WT-HFE. Because of the significant increase of SphK in C282Y cells, the effect of a SphK inhibitor (SKI) on cell survival was monitored. Again, WT-HFE cells were more sensitive to this treatment than C282Y-HFE cells, reflecting the drug resistant phenotype of C282Y-HFE cells. Treatment of cells with both simvastatin and SKI revealed a small effect on survival. Collectively, these studies indicated that C282Y-HFE markedly affected both cholesterol and sphingolipid metabolism and support the possibility that inhibition of both cholesterol synthesis/uptake and as well as synthesis of S1P as a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of cancer in carriers of C282Y-HFE. \nTaken together, the studies with both genes variants of HFE provide evidence for the role of HFE in lipid metabolism, in addition to iron management. These data argue for stratification of patients in clinical trials based on HFE genotype to better understand disease mechanism and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of treatments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8117], "author_name_tesi": "Ali-rahmani, Fatima Ghazanfar", "last_name_ssi": "Ali-rahmani", "middle_name_ssi": "Ghazanfar", "first_name_ssi": "Fatima", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Patricia Sue Grigson", "Jong Kak Yun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Dissertation Advisor", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iron", "HFE", "Cholesterol", "Alzheimer disease", "Cancer", "mouse model"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Development of Seismic Infill Wall Isolator Subframe (SIWIS) System\n", "id": "6488", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4396", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Seismic Infill Wall Isolator Subframe (SIWIS) system is developed in this study for use in building frames with masonry infill walls in order to prevent damage to columns or infill walls and to minimize life-safety hazards during potentially damaging earthquakes. Because of the conventional tight-fit construction within structure frames, infill walls participate in resisting wind and seismically induced loads. Although beneficial during wind loads and minor earthquakes, the lateral load resistance of infill walls during strong events can damage the wall or the frame because the infill wall is usually treated as a non-load bearing wall, and, thus, is not designed to carry in-plane loads. Complete isolation of infill walls by separation gaps as an alternative construction suffers from lack of convenient and satisfactory solutions for fire and acoustic protection of the gap and the out-of-plane stability of the wall. The SIWIS system, which consists of two vertical and one horizontal sandwiched light-gauge steel studs with SIWIS elements in the vertical members, is designed to allow infill wall-frame interaction under wind loading and minor-to-moderate earthquakes for reduced building drift, but to disengage them under severe damaging events. The SIWIS system acts as a \u201csacrificial\u201d component or a \u201cstructural fuse\u201d to protect the infill wall and frame from failure. \nAn experimental testing program planned and carried out tested the concept of the SIWIS system. The experimental program mainly included a series of tests on three different designs for fuse element (centerpiece) including concrete disk, steel disk, and lumber disk followed by a series of in-plane static pushover tests on a scaled  two-bay three-story steel frame in three forms of bare frame, rigid frame, and pinned frame equipped with an SIWIS device. Generalized nonlinear finite element modeling schemes were developed for infilled steel frames with and without SIWIS system. Validation of modeling schemes was accomplished by comparing the experimental observations with the numerical predictions for: (1) a previously tested and studied single-bay single-story infilled steel frame selected from the literature; and (2) the tested two-bay three-story steel frame. The analytical and experimental results show that the concept of the proposed system works as a \u201cseismic isolation\u201d system for infill walls by utilizing, initially, the beneficial stiffness and strength effects of the infill wall up to a predefined point, but, ultimately isolating the infill wall from the frame for their safety.

Following glucose replenishment, these gluconeogenic enzymes are inactivated and degraded.  The mechanisms by which these enzymes are degraded in response to glucose are dependent on the duration of starvation.  Glucose replenishment of cells starved for one day results in these proteins being degraded in the proteasome.  In contrast, replenishment of glucose to cells starved for three days leads to these proteins being degraded in the vacuole via the Vid (vacuole import and degradation) pathway.  For the Vid pathway, the proteins are sequestered in specialized vesicles termed Vid vesicles.  The Vid vesicles converge with the endocytic pathway and deliver their cargo to the vacuole for degradation.  Recent studies have shown that internalization, mediated by actin polymerization, is essential for delivery of cargo proteins to the vacuole for degradation.\n\tThe objective of this dissertation was to characterize the functions of two proteins, Vid30p and Vps34p, in the Vid pathway.  The VID30 and VPS34 genes were identified in a transposon library screen for mutants that were defective in FBPase degradation.  VPS34 encodes a class III phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase (PI3K).  It was demonstrated that VID30 and VPS34 play a critical role in the association and dissociation of Vid vesicles and actin patches respectively.  In cells lacking the VID30 gene, FBPase and the Vid vesicle protein Vid24p were not localized to actin patches, suggesting that Vid30p is important for the association of Vid vesicles and actin patches.  Vid30p contains two protein domains, a LisH (lissencephaly type 1-like homology) and a CTLH (C-terminal to the LisH) domain.  The LIS1 gene is mutated in Miller-Dieker lissencephaly.  The CTLH domain has been implicated in microtubule function.  Both domains are required for FBPase degradation.\n\tSurprisingly, ultra-structural and cell extraction studies indicated that 40-70% of FBPase was in the extracellular fraction (periplasm) during glucose starvation.  FBPase levels in the extracellular fraction (periplasm) decreased following glucose re-feeding in wild-type cells.  The decline of FBPase in the extracellular fraction was dependent on the SLA1 and ARC18 involved in actin polymerization and endocytosis.  Moreover, the decline of extracellular FBPase was also dependent on the VPS34 gene.  Vps34p is co-localized with actin patches in three-day starved cells.  In the absence of VPS34, FBPase and Vid vesicle protein Vid24p associated with actin patches before and after the addition of glucose.  When the N736 residue of Vps34p was mutated to K (which inhibits kinase activity) and when the C-terminal 11 amino acids were deleted, mutant proteins failed to localize to actin patches and FBPase in the extracellular fraction did not decrease as rapidly.  This suggests that VPS34 plays a critical role in the internalization of extracellular FBPase in response to glucose.\n\tThis dissertation defines the roles of two proteins not previously associated with the Vid pathway and implicates trafficking through the periplasm and actin polymerization mediated endocytosis in the turnover of gluconeogenic enzymes in response to glucose replenishment after prolonged starvation.\t\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7451], "author_name_tesi": "Alibhoy, Abbas Abizar", "last_name_ssi": "Alibhoy", "middle_name_ssi": "Abizar", "first_name_ssi": "Abbas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hui Ling Chiang", "Sarah Bronson", "Jin Ming Yang", "Christopher Martin Yengo", "Vincent Chau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hui Ling Chiang, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Christopher Martin Yengo, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Autophagy", "Gluconeogenesis", "Vacuole Import and Degradation", "Actin", "VPS34", "VID30"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Defining the Role of the Nonstructural Protein 4B C-Terminal Domain in Hepatitis C Virus Replication", "id": "9944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2485", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Like most positive-strand RNA viruses, the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) replication complex is associated with rearranged cytoplasmic membranes.  For HCV, a novel membrane structure, termed the membranous web, has been observed in HCV-infected cells or in cells expressing the mature NS4B.  However, we still do not understand the role of NS4B protein in HCV genome replication.  NS4B could contribute by forming the web structure, providing the scaffold for other replicase proteins, or in binding HCV RNA.  To better understand the role of NS4B in HCV genome replication, we introduced mutations in the poorly characterized C-terminal domain (CTD) in the context of the HCV subgenomic replicon.  Interestingly, these mutants all resulted in a significant decrease in HCV replication as determined by colony formation assay. Transient expression of mutant replicons, followed by immunofluorescence indicated that certain NS4B CTD point mutantss resulted in reticular staining rather than punctate foci shown in cells expressing the WT replicon.  These same mutants caused redistribution of NS5A to these reticular structures, indicating that the CTD may play a role in membranous web formation or in recruitment of other replicase proteins (or both).\nTo test the hypothesis that the NS4B CTD might play a role in membranous web formation, we deleted the entire CTD in the context of NS4B protein alone. Deletion or removal of parts of this domain resulted in loss of webs as visualized via electron microscopy.  However, expression of the CTD alone did not result in web formation, arguing that the NS4B CTD was required but not sufficient to form the web structure. Further, our data indicate that deletion of the NS4B CTD prevents NS4B from co-localizing with Rab5, an early endosomal GTPase that our laboratory has previously found to be required for HCV replication.  \nFinally, studies with an NS4B protein from an HCV-related pestivirus (Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus - BVDV) indicated that a chimeric protein consisting of the HCV N-terminus of NS4B and the C-terminus from BVDV NS4B induces the formation of foci. However, these foci were of a different morphology compared to those formed after expression of HCV NS4B.  The chimeric NS4B protein also failed to co-localize with Rab5.  These results suggest that although the NS4B CTD from related flaviviruses play a role in the formation of NS4B-asociated foci, that these structures may have alternate functions or utilize different host factors.  These factors may also be unique to the host cell utilized by these viruses.  The significance of these findings and the ramifications for the flavivirus family is discussed.\t\t\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2468], "author_name_tesi": "Aligo, Jason Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Aligo", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron", "Kouacou Konan", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Joseph C.

Because of the large number of possible combinations for the fuel assembly (FA) loading in the core, the design of the core configuration is a complex optimization problem. It requires finding an optimal FA arrangement and BP placement in order to achieve maximum cycle length while satisfying the safety constraints. \n\nGenetic Algorithms (GA) have been already used to solve this problem for LP optimization for both PWR and Boiling Water Reactor (BWR). The GA, which is a stochastic method works with a group of solutions and uses random variables to make decisions. Based on the theories of evaluation, the GA involves natural selection and reproduction of the individuals in the population for the next generation. The GA works by creating an initial population, evaluating it, and then improving the population by using the evaluation operators. \n\nTo solve this optimization problem, a LP optimization package, GARCO (Genetic Algorithm Reactor Code Optimization) code is developed in the framework of this thesis. This code is applicable for all types of PWR cores having different geometries and structures with an unlimited number of FA types in the inventory. To reach this goal, an innovative GA is developed by modifying the classical representation of the genotype. To obtain the best result in a shorter time, not only the representation is changed but also the algorithm is changed to use in-core fuel management heuristics rules.

In applications involving crystallization, the aggregation of nanoparticles can be important.  Recent experiments on specific materials, including anatase-TiO$_2$, have documented the phenomenon of oriented attachment, in which nanocrystals approach one another and merge along specific crystallographic directions to form twinned or single-crystalline structures.  The ability to direct crystallization through oriented attachment is an exciting prospect that could allow for the creation of new nanostructures with well-defined sizes and shapes.  To realize the full potential of oriented attachment for achieving the controlled synthesis of anatse nanocrystals, insight into its origins, which are not currently clear in all cases, would be beneficial.\n\nThis dissertation employs molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the issues regarding anatse nanoparticle aggregation in a vacuum and in aqueous environments. By utilizing both symmetric and asymmetric nanocrystals, the majority of the observed synthesized anatase shapes have been covered. MD simulations have been carried out to determine the aggregation pathway of such nanocrystals, and by repeating the simulation with different initial configurations, the directional alignment of these nanocrystals has been discovered in vacuum environment. Also, by performing force, energy, dipole-dipole interactions, and other sorts of calculations, the origins of the preferred alignment of anatase nanocrystals in vacuum has been discovered.\n\nOriented attachment was first discovered in experimental studies for the crystallization of anatase nanocrystals under hydrothermal aqueous conditions. For the aqueous anatase nanoparticles, the Bandura-Kubicki force field has been tested against results from first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory and refined to describe the binding of H$_2$O, H$^+$, and OH$^-$ to various crystal faces. Hence, the parameters for the available force fields have been modified to be used for anatase nanocrystals. Since MD is a very strong tool that allows solving larger systems with many water molecules, it has become possible to study the aggregation mechanism of anatase nanocrystals in an aqueous environment. Also, the difference in water adsorption on anatase surfaces under ambient and hydrothermal conditions has been studied, while hydration effects have been quantified.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4536], "author_name_tesi": "Alimohammadi Zanjani, Mozhgan ", "last_name_ssi": "Alimohammadi Zanjani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mozhgan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "James David Kubicki", "Darrell Velegol", "Michael John Janik", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Dissertation Advisor", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["rutile", "anatase", "titanium dioxide", "oriented attachment", "aggregation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Power Hungry: The Influence of Power Values Diversity on Relationship Conflict and Team Performance", "id": "23644", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10682", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite their role as motivational goals that influence behavior and social interactions, little research has invested power values in teams.

There has been increasing evidence to suggest a critical role for inflammation in breast cancer development, progression, and therapy resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this intriguing connection remain largely unresolved. The identification of therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers within the context of inflammation would represent substantial steps in the fight against breast cancer.\n\tFerritin is the primary iron storage protein in cells. Although its intracellular iron storage function has been thoroughly studied, the significance of its extracellular function in human biology is poorly understood. Clinically, circulating ferritin is used as a biomarker of inflammation or as an indicator of the body\u2019s iron stores. In the context of breast cancer, ferritin is elevated in tumor tissue as well as patients\u2019 sera and this elevation correlates with poor clinical outcome and advanced histological grade. The goal of this dissertation is to identify a tumorigenic mechanism involving the classical iron storage protein ferritin in breast cancer. Moreover and in a broader clinical context, the project also aims at the development of serum ferritin as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced cancer patients. \n\tIn support of this dissertation, I first performed a comprehensive investigation of the expression and localization of ferritin within breast tumors representing a spectrum of histological grades. As the tumor progressed from a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to an invasive ductal carcinoma, the ferritin content in cancer cells decreased while the tumor infiltration by ferritin-rich macrophages increased. Surprisingly, ferritin also stained within the stromal fibers surrounding breast tumors suggesting local ferritin release within the breast. In order to examine potential sources for the secreted ferritin, I examined the ability of macrophages and breast cancer cells to secrete ferritin in vitro. Primary macrophages but not breast cancer cells lines were capable of ferritin secretion, and this secretion was potentiated in response to iron and inflammatory cytokines. The identification of macrophages as the primary site of ferritin expression and secretion within breast tumors introduces several diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities and advances our understanding of the molecular signature of tumor-associated macrophages.  \n\tIn the second set of experiments, I utilized a breast cancer cell culture model to examine the ability of extracellular ferritin to stimulate cancer cells. Ferritin increased the proliferation of two epithelial breast cancer cell lines and was taken up by breast cancer cells indicating a direct functional interaction. These effects were seemingly independent of iron and were not due to iron delivery because: 1) iron-free ferritin had a similar effect to iron-rich ferritin, 2) the addition of iron to the culturing conditions did not increase the effects of ferritin, and 3) ferritin exposure did not increase intracellular iron levels. These novel findings propose that ferritin has an overlooked iron-independent functionality with tumorigenic significance. \n\tGiven the tumorigenic potential of extracellular ferritin, I then examined the clinical utility of serum ferritin in advanced cancer patients. Pre-treatment levels of serum ferritin were elevated in approximately half of a metastatic breast cancer cohort receiving trastuzumab-containing therapy (n=66). Elevation in serum ferritin was predictive of both progression-free and overall survival. When patients were stratified based on their serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, patients with elevation in both inflammatory biomarkers had the poorest response to therapy. To expand our findings to other cancer types, I examined the prognostic significance of serum ferritin and CRP in advanced pancreatic cancer patients from a phase III clinical trial serum bank (n=159). Serum ferritin levels were elevated in 88% of patients and they were predictive of shorter survival. Interestingly, only patients with elevation in both inflammatory biomarkers had a worse outcome than patients without detectable inflammation. Collectively, these findings provide strong support for the idea that cancer-associated inflammation represents a pro-tumorigenic phenomenon and may - directly or indirectly - impede response to cancer therapeutics. \n\tIn summary, I have identified a potential novel tumorigenic pathway by which tumor-associated macrophages stimulate breast tumors via the secretion of extracellular ferritin. I also identified a clinical predictive use for the inflammatory biomarkers serum ferritin and CRP which are elevated in a majority of breast and pancreatic cancer patients.Identifying the mechanism underlying the ferritin effect as well as elucidating the connection between serum ferritin and tumor-associated macrophages are important future research questions. Moreover, the clinical utility of anti-inflammatory drugs and life-style changes (such as exercise and diet) that may decrease inflammation should be explored as possible strategies to sensitize cancer patients to therapy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8303], "author_name_tesi": "Alkhateeb, Ahmed Awni", "last_name_ssi": "Alkhateeb", "middle_name_ssi": "Awni", "first_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "Gavin Peter Robertson", "Laura Carrel", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Sang Yong Lee", "Allan Lipton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Special Member", "Sang Yong Lee, Committee Member", "Allan Lipton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferritin", "iron", "inflammation", "cancer-associated inflammation", "breast cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A NEW OPTIMIZED DOUBLE STACKED TURNSTILE ANTENNA DESIGN", "id": "b2773v68h", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12595", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Turnstile Antenna is one of the many types of antennas that have been developed to be primarily used for omnidirectional very high frequency (VHF) communication. The basic turnstile consists of two horizontal half-wave antennas (half-wave dipoles) mounted at right angles of each other on the same plane. When these dipoles are excited with equal currents that are 90 degrees out of phase, the typical figure-eight radiation pattern of the two diploes are merged into an almost circular radiation pattern. Typically, however, the gain of such an antenna is not very high in the horizontal direction, thus to increase the gain in the horizontal and to eliminate the gain in vertical direction, pairs of the same dipole antenna are stacked vertically and are separated by a distance, thus creating the Stacked Turnstile Antenna. In the original stacked turnstile antenna design, both 50 ohm and 75 ohm cables are used to connect the dipoles, using quarter wave impedance matching transformers, which leads to inaccurate radiation patterns and a higher VSWR. In this paper, we are addressing this issue by introducing a new design using only 75 ohm cables to achieve a more proper impedance matching and omnidirectional pattern. By using this approach, we are introducing a double stacked turnstile antenna that has a more circular radiation pattern, and a low VSWR at the frequencies of desired operation. Rigorous computer modeling and simulations codes were used for designing and evaluating the antenna. Furthermore, five models of this antenna were made, three computer models and two experimental models: an aluminum tubing model at 50.1 MHz which was done by Dr. James K. Breakall, a wire model at 700 MHz, and a cylindrical model at 700 MHz modeled by the author. All of these models were optimized using the Nelder-Mead Simplex method that FEKO provides.

In fact, the failure of projects to attract active developers may prove to be the single important reason for the death of OSS projects. Therefore, recommendation services are crucially needed to automate the process of forming teams, finding the appropriate experts for a given task and suggesting open projects to potential developers.\n\nGiven the unique structure of the OSS community, the continuous growing number of OSS projects available online (over 4 millions) and the number of mixed-skilled developers (over 1 million), recommendation services become extremely challenging. In order to build successful recommendation services, we first investigate and study the OSS community structure and the social factors that affect the amount of participation and commitment in OSS projects. In particular, we conduct an extensive social link analysis on the Social Network (SN) and Affiliation Network (AN) of OSS developers. Moreover, we conduct both global and local networks analysis, where a global network analysis considers a developer's connectivity in the whole OSS community network, whereas a local network analysis considers a developer's connectivity within a team network that is affiliated to a project. The analysis demonstrates evident influence of the social factors on the developers' overall participation and productivity. We further investigate the different types of affiliations that could associate developers into collaboration such as co-participating in the same project, belonging to the same company or institution or even being in the same city. We, also, study the effect of some project features on the developers' selection of projects. The analysis results are used to build highly accurate recommendation services for OSS community. \n\nWe introduce three recommendation services for OSS community members. First, we consider the expert recommendation problem for members of the community. Given a query developer and a task in hand, the expert recommender service introduces experts to facilitate collaboration between newbie developers and experts. In this particular problem, we solve the issue of experts responsiveness to queries, where experts, usually, tend to ignore the requests to participate. Another issue is data sparsity problem since most new members have few data history which is a challenge to recommender systems. To solve these challenges we propose a recommender system that uses the Degree of Knowledge and Social Relative Importance aspects in recommending experts who are knowledgeable on the skills required and highly responsive to queries. \n\nSecond, we consider the project recommendation problem for members of the community. Project recommendation is a unique problem since it involves recommending an item that requires a continuous action and commitment. This is not the case for consuming items such as books or software. We propose several models that use two main aspects that attract developers into joining a project. The first aspect is the project content and the second aspect is the peer affiliation influence where we identify three kinds of affiliation ties, namely, project, work and location affiliations. \n\nThe third recommender service considers recommending members to collaborate in a project as a team, which is know as the team formation problem in literature. Given a project/task with certain skills required and an upper bound of team size, the recommender service shall find a team that cover all the required skills and their Degree of Acquaintance (DoA) is maximized. We define the DoA in terms of the local clustering coefficient and the strength of social ties between the team members. OSS data analysis shows the importance of the connectivity and social tie strength to the overall productivity of the teams in open projects. This  problem is NP-hard. We propose three algorithms to solve the defined problem. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms to find a well acquainted teams satisfying a given query. We further show that using the DoA, as a social closeness measure, produces more socially close teams than measures like graph diameter and density.  \n\nFor the analysis and the evaluation of the proposed recommender services, we use datasets collected from Github.com and Openhub.net (previously Ohloh.net), which are two fast-growing and large-scale online OSS communities. The evaluation of the recommender services shows promising results of recommending experts, projects and teams to developers in the community.

In addition, we explored methods to improve the assessment of reproductive health in female populations of varying age. To this end, this dissertation includes four studies that 1) retrospectively assess the agreement between daily and reduced sample collection frequencies of estrone-1-glucuronide (E1G) and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG) exposure, 2) prospectively assess the compliance to reduced sample collection frequencies, 3) evaluate the impact of combine hormonal contraceptive (CHC) use on hepatic insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) production, and 4) determine if non-traditional dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measures of body composition predict menstrual recovery in exercising women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). We observed the following main findings: 1) with perfect collection all three reduced sample collection frequencies had good agreement with daily sample collection regarding E1G and PdG exposure and integrated mean; 2) adolescent girls were more compliant to collecting 3 samples/week than to 2 samples/week, which enabled us to observe evidence of luteal activity in 32% of the adolescent menstrual cycles, 3) route of CHC administration suppresses hepatic IGF-1 production, such that a reduction was observed following combined oral contraceptive (COC) use but not contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) use, 4) the strongest predictor of resumption of menses is post-study body fat percentage in exercising young women with FHA, while post-study leg percent fat was an additional strong predictor of menstrual recovery. Overall, research evaluating reproductive status in adolescent and young, adult women can utilize a reduced sampling frequency; however, use of 2 samples/week is not recommended due to low compliance to the specified collection dates. Additionally, evaluating the long-term effect of CHC use on bone physiology requires continued, vested interest with the development of new therapies. Similar interventions with larger samples and longer in duration are necessary to confirm and expand the findings of CHC route of administration influence on IGF-1 and bone heath, as well as in understanding whether non-traditional body composition measures are more indicative of the potential for the resumption of menses within the complex interplay of body composition and energetic signals.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14005], "author_name_tesi": "Allaway, Heather Christina", "last_name_ssi": "Allaway", "middle_name_ssi": "Christina", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Jane De Souza", "Mary Jane De Souza", "Nancy I.

GABA-A receptor clustering at postsynaptic sites is critical for the function of inhibitory synapse. Moreover, changes in synaptic receptor concentration are believed to contribute to functional plasticity of neurons. Typical postsynaptic GABA-A receptor subtypes are composed of alpha, beta, and gamma2 subunits and they are co-localized at synapses with the putative clustering protein gephyrin, which is thought to link GABA-A receptors to the cytoskeleton. The multifunctional protein gephyrin represents a major component of the subsynaptic protein scaffold of inhibitory synapses and provides an interface for interaction with diverse other postsynaptic proteins including components of the microtubule and actin cytoskleton, as well as the GDP-GTP exchange factor collybistin, which is implicated in postsynaptic deposition of gephyrin. \n\nAnalysis of gamma2 subunit-deficient mice and neurons revealed that the gamma2 subunit is essential for postsynaptic clustering of GABA-A receptors and gephyrin, but largely dispensable for expression of functional GABA-gated chloride channels at the cell surface (Essrich et al., 1998). Interaction of the gamma2 subunit with diverse putative trafficking proteins of GABA-A receptors, such as GABARAP and GODZ, further suggests that this subunit acts as an important determinant of postsynaptic receptor concentration. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which the gamma2 subunit contributes to accumulation of GABA-A receptors at synapses is poorly understood.\n\nThe main objective of this doctoral thesis was to determine the subunit domain(s) of the gamma2 subunit that are essential (i) for proper trafficking and localization of postsynaptic GABA-A receptors (ii) for recruitment of gephyrin to postsynaptic GABA-A receptors and (iii) for normal inhibitory synaptic function of postsynaptic GABA-A receptors in gamma2 subunit-deficient neurons.  Surprisingly, the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) of the gamma2 subunit was found to be sufficient for postsynaptic localization of GABA-A receptors. However, the cytoplasmic loop domain is required in addition to TM4 for recruitment of gephyrin to postsynaptic GABA-A receptors and for restoration of inhibitory synaptic function. These experiments point to a novel mechanism in subcellular targeting of ligand-gated ion channels and clearly dissociate postsynaptic GABA-A receptor targeting mechanisms from interaction with gephyrin.\n\nAs part of a collaborative project with Dr. Harvey\u2019s group at UC London, I was involved in mapping the protein-protein interaction domains between gephyrin and the GTP exchange factor collybistin to further elucidate their roles in synaptic localization and anchoring of GABA-A receptors at the postsynaptic membrane.  These experiments revealed that proper localization of gephyrin requires both the plextrin homology domain of collybistin and the collybistin binding sequence in gephyrin. Additionally, a single point mutation in the SH3 domain of collybistin known to underlie an atypical form of hyperekplexia in humans was shown to result in mislocalization of gephyrin and postsynaptic GABA-A receptors in transfected neurons. These experiments for the first time showed an essential function of collybistin in formation of GABAergic inhibitory synapses \n\nFinally, preliminary results addressing the role of palmitoylation of the gamma2 subunit of GABA-A receptors with respect to postsynaptic localization of GABA-A receptors suggest that proper localization of GABA-A receptors can occur independently of palmitoylation. Rather than proper localization, palmitoylation is therefore implicated in regulating the stability of GABA-A receptors in the plasma membrane. Preliminary experiments also addressed potential functional redundancy between different members of the GABA-A receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) family of gamma2 subunit binding proteins implicated in trafficking of GABA-A receptors. The results suggest that different members of the GABARAP family of proteins are functionally redundant with respect to interaction with GABA-A receptors, gephyrin and N-maleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4125], "author_name_tesi": "Alldred, Melissa J", "last_name_ssi": "Alldred", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Douglas Cavener", "Randen Patterson", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Randen Patterson, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GABA-A receptors", "gephyrin", "collybistin", "synaptic localization"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Propagation and Clutter Considerations for Long Range Radar Surveillance Using Noise Waveforms", "id": "13374jma5398", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of noise waveforms is investigated for long range radar surveillance.  In addition to the noise signal, a chirp waveform was also simulated for the various scenarios to act as a  direct comparison of traditional radar signals.  The correlation and relative ratio of received to transmitted power was found for the two waveforms after reflecting from simple targets and terrain.  For the simple shapes, the correlation of the two signals were similar in value and pattern with respect to incidence angle.  The reflection from terrain gave smaller correlations for the noise waveform indicating that it may be less susceptible to false alarms when terrain is considered clutter.  Advanced simulations were then run with a realistic hummer target and terrain clutter model.  Accounting for the atmospheric propagation loss, system gains, and receiver noise, the probability of detection and false alarm were found to create receiver operating characteristic curves.  It was found that the noise waveform performs as well as the chirp for cases of strong clutter response, and much better for cases of weak clutter response.  Next, modeling radar propagation as a series of cascaded two-port devices was explored.  This allowed different sections of propagation, such as through air or rain, to be computed separately for a particular wavelength and then combined together to form a set of system parameters.  The first radar that was modeled was forward-looking which examined an air-rain-air-target scenario.  The system parameters for this case were computed for various rain rates and rain path lengths then applied to the noise and chirp waveforms.  It was found the both the noise and chirp signals resulted in similar correlations with respect to path length and rain rate.  The final radar that was modeled was down-looking where the waveforms were reflected and transmitted through different layers of soil with various moisture content.  The correlation of both waveforms were similar in that they varied with path length due to the phase introduced by the system S11 parameter.  However, the noise signal correlation was consistently lower than the chirp's. This again indicates that the noise waveform may be a better alternative for reducing clutter false alarms.  Finally, the use of double spectral processing for determining target ranges was investigated in comparison to the use of cross-correlation.  It was found that while the double spectral processing method efficiently determines target range, it produces echo responses in the case of multiple targets which may cause false alarms.  Additionally, this method has lower peak-to-average responses than the correlation for noisy return signals, again increasing the false alarm rate.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13256], "author_name_tesi": "Allebach, Joshua M", "last_name_ssi": "Allebach", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "Ram Mohan Narayanan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Committee Member", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Radar", "Noise Radar", "Long Range Radar", "Noise Waveform"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "BLUEprint for self-authorship: A case study exploration of a peer mentoring program", "id": "14188jxa5209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14188", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As higher education professionals consider establishing or expanding mentoring programs as mediums through which to achieve student retention and success, particularly among certain student sub-populations, it is important to understand more about the effectiveness and best practices of current programs in the field.

An extensive body of research exists and continues to mount, geared at uncovering the answer or set of answers that would help solve this dilemma.  \nThis research study explored the role of career maturity in the persistence process with the premise that higher levels of career maturity contribute to students\u2019 ability to persist through postsecondary education.  This premise formed the basis for the research questions: 1) Is career maturity related to the college grade point average (GPA) of first-year students? 2) Is career maturity related to college persistence of first-year students?\n225 first-year students at a branch campus of the Pennsylvania State University were targeted, of which 169 or 75% voluntarily participated.  The Career Maturity Inventory (CMI), comprised of two-25 point sections (attitude and competence), was used as the assessment tool for measuring career maturity.  Students were given the CMI three times during the year: the end of their first semester (fall 2004) and spring semester (spring 2005), as well as the beginning of their following year (fall 2005).   At each checkpoint, students\u2019 enrollment status and GPA were closely monitored.  Both multiple and logistic regression data analysis methods were used to draw conclusions regarding the relationship between career maturity and GPA as well as career maturity and persistence.\n The study findings revealed a positive, significant relationship between career maturity and first-year persistence.  Additionally, competence, an aspect of career maturity, was related to students\u2019 GPA at the end of their first semester (fall 2004) while the overall \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t         iv\ncareer maturity score was related to students\u2019 GPA at the end of their second semester (spring 2005).  This suggests that competence or specific knowledge is a more important factor in students\u2019 performance the first semester than in the second semester.  Whereas, a more general sense or internalization of career maturity grows increasingly more important as students progress throughout their first year.\nAs limited studies exist regarding the role of career maturity in the college persistence process, the findings are particularly promising.  They provide the opportunity for further research and exploration of an overlooked but important intervening variable within the persistence debate that has received little attention in the past.  Additionally,  a focus on career maturity provides insight and depth of knowledge regarding potential solutions that can help address the persistence problem.   Unlike a number of other factors linked with persistence such as socio-economic status (SES) and parental educational level, career maturity can be affected.  This finding provides hope that appropriate career development interventions, which foster career maturity, ultimately increase the likelihood that students are better equipped to finish the degrees they begin.  \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1605], "author_name_tesi": "Allen, Dara Ware", "last_name_ssi": "Allen", "middle_name_ssi": "Ware", "first_name_ssi": "Dara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Carter Gray", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Cynthia Pellock", "James B Stewart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Carter Gray, Committee Chair", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Member", "James B Stewart, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["retention", "college persistence", "career maturity"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": " Child Maltreatment and Adolescent Externalizing Behavior: The Potential Mediating Role of Peers", "id": "15031eka10", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study examined the association between peer relationships and externalizing behavior in a sample of high-risk youth during the transition to adolescence.

However, when the molten metal is poured into the mold and around the petrochemical cores, the core binder decomposition releases VOCs that are then released into the surrounding environment. The goal of this research was to evaluate and advance the development of a sodium silicate and hydrolyzed collagen core binder to prevent VOC formation by petrochemical binder replacement.\n\nThe first study discussed in this thesis is of a full-scale demonstration of 244 sodium silicate and hydrolyzed collagen bonded sand cores used in casting trials in a production foundry. The results showed that  no core-related casting scrap rate was achieved and that core shake-out was satisfactory. These favorable results were achieved with proper storage of the cores before they were used. Following this trial, lab scale studies were performed to evaluate core binder performance. These studies revealed optimum binder levels to develop tensile strength returns at ambient temperatures. Conventional sodium silicate catalysts were not a viable means of core box curing and the hybrid sodium silicate and hydrolyzed collagen binder system was hydroscopic. This information, along with many core making efficiency improvements, was used to carry out a large scale casting demonstration with 3,476 cores. During the use of these cores at a full-scale foundry, pouring, cooling, and shake-out VOC emissions were 31% higher when conventional phenolic urethane cores were used than when these novel trial cores were used. In conclusion, this thesis supports sodium silicate and hydrolyzed collagen as a niche VOC-reducing alternative to petrochemical binders with the caveat that future work is needed to enhance core-related casting surfaces and storage humidity resistance of cores. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10119], "author_name_tesi": "Allen, Joshua F", "last_name_ssi": "Allen", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Metal casting", "air emissions", "stack test", "core binder", "foundry", "pollution prevention", "collagen", "sodium silicate"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Transnational Advocacy Networks and Information Politics: INGOs and the Collaboration for free speech in CUBA", "id": "25129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11085", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bringing the Transnational Advocacy Network (TAN) theory into the world of digital activism, this project explores how international nongovernmental organizational (INGOs) members of a TAN use social media to interact with local activists in their advocacy for freedom of speech in Cuba.

While each of the latter is of secondary importance, they are necessary to provide technological and ideological context for the study.  Ideological variations in conceptualizations of freedom of speech and expression are delineated, not only for context, but also to provide a greater transparency in the research, given the potential for latent or implicit biases in cross-cultural studies.\nThe social media content of GenY and the select INGOs provided rich data.

Data revealed overall patterns that were supported by in-depth \u201csnapshots\u201d of INGO dissemination of GenY information.\nUnder the theoretical umbrella of TAN information politics, a mixed-methods approach was applied.

The results call for a re-examination of the credibility of such reports given the profound foreign policy influence that is wielded INGOs, especially in light of the fragile beginning of normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10657], "author_name_tesi": "Allen, Katharine Reed", "last_name_ssi": "Allen", "middle_name_ssi": "Reed", "first_name_ssi": "Katharine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Spicer Nichols", "John Spicer Nichols", "Amit Schejter", "Martin Halstuk", "Sophia A Mcclennen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Spicer Nichols, Dissertation Advisor", "John Spicer Nichols, Committee Chair", "Amit Schejter, Committee Member", "Martin Halstuk, Committee Member", "Sophia A Mcclennen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transnational Advocacy Networks", "INGOs", "Freedom of Speech", "Cuba"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "QR Signal Detection in the Presence Of AM Noise", "id": "19652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis proposes a matched filter approach to detect quadrupole resonance (QR) signals in the presence of disturbance from AM stations. Detecting QR signals is a challenge due to several reasons. One is the amplitude of a QR signal is typically on the same level of thermal noise, which makes it very susceptible to noise interferences. External Radio Frequency (RF) interferences, such as AM signals, and internal RF interferences, ones from inside the search volume, pose another challenge and contribute to the low SNR values observed. AM stations broadcast within the same frequency band of QR signals, which is a problem for QR detection. A third important challenge we face is the uncertainty in the QR signal characteristics.\n\nTo motivate the use of a matched filter approach, a matched filter (under the assumption that the QR signal is known) was compared to the generic energy detector in theory and it resulted in a performance improvement. The work proposes a detector referred to as the batch matched filter, which uses a gridding technique to search for unknown QR signal parameters and attempts to match the filter to the shape of the QR signal present. This approach resulted in a performance gain when compared to the generic energy detector using simulation and experimental data, where the QR signal is unknown. To further improve performance we introduced an approach that would also match the filter to the noise present in addition to the QR signal. This approach is referred to as the batch whitened matched filter and when properly matched to the noise outperforms both the batch matched filter and energy detector.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9334], "author_name_tesi": "Almahri, Abdullah ", "last_name_ssi": "Almahri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abdullah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "David Miller", "Patrick M Lenahan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Committee Member", "David Miller, Committee Member", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Matched Filter", "Robust Matched Filter", "Whitening", "Energy Detector", "QR Detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Critical Parameters Affecting the Formation of Wormholes in Acid Stimulation of Carbonate Formations", "id": "26579", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Well stimulation has been the norm in the petroleum industry for decades to increase well productivity or injectivity. The increase in the productivity or the injectivity index of a certain well comes from smaller drawdown pressure and less formation damage.\nFormation damage around the wellbore can be caused by several factors such as completion, perforation, drilling fluids, chemical precipitations, fine migration, and EOR fluids. In order to overcome this formation damage which restricts the flow of fluids between the wellbore and the rock matrix, acids are pumped through the wellbore and into the rock formation. As a result of a reaction triggered by the acid, highly conductive channels form which connect the wellbore to the undamaged rock matrix, thus bypassing the damaged zone. These highly conductive channels are known as wormholes.\nWormholes as the name implies are tube-like, highly branched conduits. The degree of branching as well as the size of the wormhole dictates how effective these wormholes are. Therefore, an optimum type of wormholes with the right amount of branching and the right size is always desirable.\nThe objective of this study is to understand how different dissolution patterns which form during a typical acid treatment affect the overall effectiveness of an acidizing treatment. Using a 3-D core scale model, the theory of an optimum wormhole condition is tested and the effect of several other parameters on the resulting dissolution pattern are examined. The parameters which are examined include injection rate, acid concentration, permeability-porosity relations, heterogeneity magnitude, reservoir pressure, reaction rate, mineral solubility, and acid diffusivity. After simulating the effect of each one of these parameters on the wormhole, the resulting trends are compared to preexisting trends in the literature. Moreover, a scale up method is adopted in this study to examine how the effect of these parameters translates on the field scale. Finally, a post acid treatment flow chart, based on observations from all the simulation runs, is developed to suggest a method to utilize the results from a single acid job and apply it to future treatments.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11195], "author_name_tesi": "Almarri, Hamad ", "last_name_ssi": "Almarri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hamad", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stimulation", "Acid", "Wormhole", "Carbonate"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SELECTIVE ADSORPTION FOR REMOVAL OF NITROGEN COMPOUNDS FROM HYDROCARBON STREAMS OVER CARBON-BASED ADSORBENTS\n\n", "id": "9679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4345", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ultimate goal of this thesis is to develop a fundamental understanding of the role of surface oxygen functional groups on carbon-based adsorbents in the adsorption of nitrogen compounds that are known to be present in liquid fuels. N2 adsorption was used to characterize pore structures. The surface chemical properties of the adsorbents were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) techniques with a mass spectrometer to identify and quantify the type and concentration of oxygen functional groups on the basis of CO2 and CO evolution profiles. It was found that although surface area and pore size distribution are important for the adsorption process, they are not primary factors in the adsorption of nitrogen compounds. On the other hand, both the type and concentration of surface oxygen-containing functional groups play an important role in determining adsorptive denitrogenation performance. Higher concentrations of the oxygen functional groups on the adsorbents resulted in a higher adsorption capacity for the nitrogen compounds. A fundamental insight was gained into the contributions of different oxygen functional groups by analyzing the changes in the monolayer maximum adsorption capacity, qm, and the adsorption constant, K, for nitrogen compounds on different activated carbons. Acidic functional groups such as carboxylic acids and carboxylic anhydrides appear to contribute more to the adsorption of quinoline, while the basic oxygen functional groups such as carbonyls and quinones enhance the adsorption of indole.\nDespite the high number of publications on the adsorptive desulfurization of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, these studies did not consider the presence of coexisting nitrogen compounds. It is well-known that, to achieve ultraclean diesel fuel, sulfur must be reduced to a very low level, where the concentrations of nitrogen and sulfur compounds are comparable. The adsorptive denitrogenation and desulfurization of model diesel fuel, which contains equimolar concentrations of nitrogen (i.e., quinoline and indole), sulfur (i.e., dibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene), and aromatic compounds (naphthalene, 1-methylnaphthalene, and fluorene), was examined. The results revealed that when both nitrogen and sulfur compounds coexist in the fuel, the type and density of oxygen functional groups on the surface of the activated carbon are crucial for selective adsorption of nitrogen compounds but have negligible positive effects for sulfur removal. The adsorption of quinoline and indole is largely governed by specific interactions. There is enough evidence to support the importance of dipole\u2013dipole and acid-base-specific interactions for the adsorption of both quinoline and indole. \nModified carbon is a promising material for the efficient removal of the nitrogen compounds from light cycle oil (LCO). Adsorptive denitrogenation of LCO significantly improved the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) performance, especially for the removal of the refractory sulfur compounds such as 4-methyldibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene.\nAn essential factor in applying activated carbon for adsorptive denitrogenation and desulfurization of liquid hydrocarbon streams is regeneration after saturation. The regeneration method of the saturated adsorbents consisted of toluene washing followed by heating to remove the remaining toluene. The results show that the spent activated carbon can be regenerated to completely recover the adsorption capacity. The high capacity and selectivity of activated carbon for nitrogen compounds, along with their ability to be regenerated, indicate that activated carbon is a promising adsorbent for the deep denitrogenation of liquid hydrocarbon streams.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4317], "author_name_tesi": "Almarri, Masoud S.", "last_name_ssi": "Almarri", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Masoud", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Chunshan Song", "Xiaoliang Ma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Xiaoliang Ma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Light cycle oil", "Diesel fuel", "Desulfurization", "Denitrogenation", "Adsorption", "Activated carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The invasion, dynamics, and impacts of infectious disease in Yellowstone's wolf population", "id": "24858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11053", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My research seeks to address the broad questions of how parasites invade, their individual and population-level impacts on their hosts, and the drivers of heterogeneity observed in infection risk, severity, and outcome within the system of reintroduced gray wolves of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming.

These teachers have taught Arabic language arts and skills separately through the specialized textbooks as directed for many decades by the Ministry of Education and district mandates. In late 2007 the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia decreed a change towards integrating the language arts in both teaching and students\u2019 textbooks. This new language arts program is being applied since then in 40 elementary and middle schools in different school districts before it was circulated to all schools around the country in September 2010. The main goal of this study is to explore the teachers\u2019 opinions toward the integration within the Arabic language after having tried in their own schools and compared it with the former method they have used for several years. This study analyzed the current practices in teaching the Arabic language and examined to what extent this change has been efficient according to the teachers applying the integrated approach. The study also examined their perceptions about the problems and barriers that affect the implementation of the integration. Moreover, this study discovered the impact of such a change on students\u2019 communication skills and how efficient the approach was on their motivation to learn the Arabic language. Additionally, the study assessed the extent to which such method fits the Arabic language and how teachers see the appropriateness of the provided Arabic textbooks and the practiced evaluation methods to the integration approach. The level of teachers\u2019 enthusiasm to this approach and their satisfaction with implementing this program were also discovered. The results of this study revealed that 84% of the Arabic language teachers see the integration within the Arabic language arts important as it is an efficient way of teaching students, which increases flexibility in teaching, and encourages critical thinking and deeper comprehension. This study discovered that 79% of the teachers see the integrated Arabic language curriculum effective in helping them achieve the teaching goals. About 73% of the teachers agreed that the integrated Arabic language curriculum and the integrative approach had a positive impact on their students\u2019 language skills. For students\u2019 motivation, 82.7% of the teachers believed that the integrated Arabic language curriculum and the integrative approach had a positive impact on their students\u2019 learning motivation. As for the integration barriers, the results revealed that 73.71% of the teachers believed that the large number of students in the classroom was a big barrier obstructing the integration practice, while only 53.71% believed that insufficiency of the equipment and school supplies was a big barrier, and only 49.14% believed that the insufficiency of teachers training and development was a large barrier affecting the integration. This study found that 85% of the teachers were satisfied with the new integrated Arabic language curriculum they teach and they enjoyed teaching Arabic in this approach more than the previous separated curriculum. Findings discovered that 92% of teachers believed that the Arabic language is suitable to the integration notion. About 71.57% of them believed that the students\u2019 Arabic textbooks provided by the Ministry of Education for this new program were appropriate for applying the integration approach, and only 44.73% of the teachers believed that the students\u2019 assessment procedures applied and the evaluation methods practiced were appropriate to assess students\u2019 language learning. Most of teachers\u2019 recommendation for improving the implementation of the integrated curriculum were concerning increasing the number of training courses and improving the quality and comprehensiveness of training; providing the necessary educational means and equipment such as computers, CD-ROM's, DVD\u2019s, and projectors; and reducing students\u2019 number in classrooms. Finally, this study found significant differences between male and female teachers on all the integration variables. Female teachers favored the integration program the most and expressed its effect on their students more than the male teachers did. These differences may be due to the fact that the female teachers had more teaching experience than the male teachers. In addition, the results showed that 70% of the female teachers had training before implementing the program, while only 47% of the male teachers had that kind of training. The more experience that the female teachers had in teaching Arabic language, and the more training they received might have positively affected their opinions and their implementation of this program. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10365], "author_name_tesi": "Almoaiqel, Salman Abdullah", "last_name_ssi": "Almoaiqel", "middle_name_ssi": "Abdullah", "first_name_ssi": "Salman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Jamie Myers", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Angiline Louisa Whitney", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Angiline Louisa Whitney, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Teaching Arabic Language Arts", "Integrated Approach", "Perceptions of Saudi School Teachers", "Integrating Arabic Language Arts"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": " Situating Privacy in the Technology Supported Collaborative Practices of the Saudi Arabian Workplace: Lessons on Socio-spatial and Socio-technical and Socio-Spatial Design", "id": "15313ssa5112", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Saudi Arabia can no longer depend on oil sales as its main economic powerhouse and must diversify its economy. Because of this, Saudi Arabia announced a future Vision for the year 2030. One focus of the Vision is to encourage greater workforce participation in the private sector, especially among women. Saudi women are a wasted resource as they make up only 21.4 percent of the Saudi national labor force and have an unemployment rate of 32.7 percent (GAS, 2017). While the Vision is depending on new partnerships with private companies to increase female employment, it is not addressing the main cause of low female participation in the private sector: workplaces are not designed to accommodate Saudi women. Unlike in the public sector, many workplaces in the private sector enact collaborative practices not in line with Saudi women\u2019s privacy values (i.e. mixed gender workspaces and interactions), which discourage them from applying for those roles (Ministry of Labor, 2016). Therefore, in order to increase female employment in the private sector, the focus should not only be on creating jobs, but also instituting culturally sensitive, privacy aware technology supported collaborative workplace practices. \nSupporting collaborative practices in the workplace entails an understanding of the interplay between technology, people, and physical space. Researchers in the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) have been studying socio-technical issues in collaborative work for decades, focusing on combining understandings of social psychology and organizational aspects of group work with collaborative software. Drawing from other fields of research that have also worked towards supporting collaborative practices, I take the position that the socially constructed meanings of space in human interaction (positions and physical distance) and in the physical world (configurations of architecture, furniture, and technology) significantly impact technology supported collaborative practices, and should be considered alongside socio-technical issues.\n            To investigate these issues, I utilized the Value Sensitive Design framework to consider privacy values in every step of my research. I focused on people and the social systems that are affected by and effect technology. I extended the framework by also focusing on how spatial configuration supports or hinders privacy values and supplements technology. I went through three investigations: conceptual, empirical, and technical. Through the conceptual investigation, I was able to define what privacy meant within the Saudi Arabian context. I delved deeper in the empirical and technical investigations by conducting a case study of a local private sector company operating in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I used observations, interviews, and participatory design sessions to gather my data.\n            My findings indicate that in order to enact value sensitive collaborative practices, the company went through privacy negotiations whereby they adapted and optimized to find what works for the employees. When privacy concerns were met through the design of socio-technical support systems and socio-spatial configuration, the collaboration was optimized; otherwise, employees either felt marginalized, or overcrowded, thus they were unable to function as effectively. Through this research, I discuss privacy concerns and offer insight on socio-spatial configuration and socio-technical design of technology.\n            There are several contributions that I make through this study. First, I propose the extension of the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework to contribute more broadly to supporting collaborative activity by supplementing socio-technical design with understandings of socio-spatial configuration. I also contribute to the understandings of privacy in the Arab world. Finally, I provide researchers, technology designers, policy makers, and organizations insight on value sensitive collaborative practices in the Saudi Arabian workplace. These considerations may increase participation in the private sector, diversify the country\u2019s income streams, and lead to economic prosperity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16875], "author_name_tesi": "Almoaiqel, Sarah ", "last_name_ssi": "Almoaiqel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Millar Carroll", "John Millar Carroll", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Lynette Marie Yarger", "Elaine Farndale"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Millar Carroll, Dissertation Advisor", "John Millar Carroll, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Member", "Elaine Farndale, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Human Computer Interaction", "Value Sensitive Design", "Socio-Technical", "Socio-Spatial", "Privacy", "Computer Supported Cooperative Work"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Study of the Socio-technical Influences on Information and Communications Technology in Girls' Schools in Saudi Arabia ", "id": "24804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The integration of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) in the classroom has shown to have many benefits. Consequently, educational authorities around the world have been pressuring schools and teachers to integrate ICTs into the classroom. The Saudi Arabian government began its ICT-related educational reform by providing resources, such as resource rooms with interactive whiteboards and projectors in classrooms, and mandating teachers to become ICT adopters. Unfortunately, few gains have been observed and many challenges have yet to be addressed. This study focuses on ICT adoption in Saudi Arabian girl\u2019s schools and examines the challenges to the currently partial ICT integration and to the goal of full ICT integration. \nTo investigate ICT integration in schools, I conducted an interview-based study of teachers and school administrators in six Saudi Arabian girls\u2019 public schools. My findings indicate that for Saudi Arabia to succeed in ICT integration in education, the government must first address the challenges to the currently partial ICT integration and then address the upcoming challenges for full integration of ICTs in the classroom. Factors that affect the currently partial ICT integration include: (1) formal training, (2) adequate resources, (3) awareness of value of ICTs, and (4) teacher evaluation. Full ICT integration creates challenges such as: (1) ICT curricula and ICT-pedagogy integration, (2) technical support, and (3) additional resources. Four different cultural insights were uncovered through this study: (1) effect of organizational culture on ICT integration, (2) effect of curricular differences between genders on ICT integration, (3) effect of perceived gender role on ICT integration, and (4) effect of social customs and traditions on ICT integration. The Saudi government must take into consideration the influence of culture as it attempts to integrate ICTs into the classroom. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10624], "author_name_tesi": "Almoaiqel, Sarah ", "last_name_ssi": "Almoaiqel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information and Communications Technology", "Integration", "Socio-Technical"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development and Utilization of Integrated Artificial Expert Systems for Designing Multi-lateral Well Configurations, Estimating Reservoir Properties and Forecasting Reservoir Performance", "id": "18780", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9058", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reservoir simulation is one of the main tools if not the most important one reservoir engineers use to forecast a reservoir performance. Nevertheless, developing and operating a reservoir simulator in the first place can be an arduous task that requires a set of highly skilled individuals in science, advanced mathematics, programing, and reservoir engineering and powerful computational models. \n\tThe reliability of a reservoir simulator depends on the availability and the quality of the reservoir properties. These properties are obtained from open-hole logs, core studies and well testing analysis which can sometimes be prohibitively cost intensive.  \n\tAnother important component of the overall process affecting the reservoir performance is the multilateral well configuration. Achieving the right design of a multilateral well configuration is a complex problem due to the vast possibilities of well forms that need to be evaluated.\n\tIn light of the above, this dissertation demonstrates the development and the application of a set of integrated artificial expert systems in the area of forecasting, reservoir evaluation and multilateral well design. The applied method has gradually progressed in degrees of complexity from addressing a preliminary case of volumetric single phase gas reservoirs completed with only dual-laterals towards an expanded form of the same system with varying multi-laterals and reservoir properties to eventually and successfully implementing it to multiphase reservoirs with bottom water drive systems completed with multi-laterals (choice of 2-5 laterals). The developed method and tools cover a wide spectrum of rock and fluid properties spanning tight to conventional sands. The developed approach successfully delivers a total of five distinct artificial expert systems, three of them serve as proxies to the conventional numerical simulator for predicting reservoir performance in terms of cumulative oil recovery, cumulative oil and gas productions and estimating the end of plateau and abandonment times and a third one for predicting cumulative fluid production. These aforementioned systems are categorized as forward-looking solutions. Whereas the other two artificial expert systems are categorized as inverse-looking solutions, one that addresses the multi-lateral well design problem and the other that estimates critical reservoir properties that can be used at the very least as first estimators in assist history matching problems and for improving the assessment of nearby prospects in field development or in-fill drilling exercises. \n\tFurthermore, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in conjunction with the expert systems structured are developed and assembled together for standalone installation. These GUIs allow the engineer to edit and input data, produce results numerically and graphically, compare results with a commercial numerical simulator, and generate an interactive 3-D visualization of the multilateral well.\nIt is expected that the developed integrated artificial expert systems will immensely reduce expenses and time requirements and effectively enhance the overall decision-making process. However, it is worth noting that the proposed expert systems are not to replace the conventional and well established procedures and protocols but rather as auxiliary or complementary applications, where applicable, to relief some of the computational overhead, provide educated estimation of key reservoir properties or the very least help fine tune them and present the inverse-looking solution to the multi-lateral well design problem or the least a starting point.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8889], "author_name_tesi": "Almousa, Talal Saeed", "last_name_ssi": "Almousa", "middle_name_ssi": "Saeed", "first_name_ssi": "Talal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Li Li", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member", "Li Li, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ANN", "Artificial Neural Network", "Expert Systems", "Well Design", "Characterization", "Forecasting", "Reservoir Simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF HEAT TRANSFER DURING QUENCHING OF A HEATED ROD", "id": "14854tka5098", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14854", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quenching experiments of a cylindrical rod were conducted in a distilled water pool in order to study the behavior of the critical heat flux (CHF) and the minimum heat flux (MHF). The effects of liquid subcooling, initial rod temperature, and surface condition on CHF and MHF were investigated during the quench process. The test specimen is a hollow stainless steel rod. The tip of the specimen is welded to prevent any water leakage inside the rod.  The specimen has two thermocouples, one at the inner diameter and the other embedded in the wall. Both thermocouples are located at the same axial elevation. During the experiment, all thermocouple readings were taken by a data acquisition system. In addition, a video was recorded by a high-speed video camera for visualization of the boiling phenomenon. The surface heat flux was calculated using a 1-D inverse heat conduction code at each location.\nIt has been found that the MHF and CHF were significantly influenced by the degree of subcooling. However, the MHF and CHF values were almost independent of initial rod temperature and surface condition. The calculated surface heat flux based on each thermocouple location was found to be consistent during the film boiling regime. The inconsistency in the evaluated surface heat fluxes at both locations begins after the MHF point and reaches a maximum near the CHF. After the CHF point, the inconsistency decays dramatically. The inconsistency in CHF values could be related to the axial conduction effect due to the large temperature gradient above and below the quench front. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15992], "author_name_tesi": "Almudhhi, Turki Khalid", "last_name_ssi": "Almudhhi", "middle_name_ssi": "Khalid", "first_name_ssi": "Turki", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan-Bill B Cheung"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan-Bill B Cheung, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pool boiling", "Heat transfer", "Quenching", "critical heat flux"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "KUWAIT EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHERS\u2019 REPORTED NEEDS AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF SOCIO-EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: A CASE STUDY", "id": "wd375w28x", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12989", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Educators have proposed the integration of socio-emotional intelligence (SEI) competences to Early Childhood Education (ECE).

More specifically, I aim to understand how individuals who were exposed to verbal aggression in childhood adapt to conflict as reflected in their physiological stress response system.  \nAs a foundation for understanding the influence of familial verbal aggression, I begin Chapter 1 by elaborating on the definition of verbal aggression.  Next, I review the frequency of conflict, origins of conflict, and effects of conflict in familial relationships.  Then, I discuss research highlighting how exposure to conflict affects children, and I describe the mechanisms that explain how childhood exposure to conflict influences future experiences of conflict.  \nThis dissertation positions exposure to familial verbal aggression during childhood as a source of stress.  Accordingly, in Chapter 2, I discuss stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the production of cortisol.  I also describe the negative psychological, behavioral, and physiological outcomes associated with an impaired HPA axis due to chronic stress.  In addition, I argue that frequent familial conflict can operate as a source of chronic stress.  Finally, I offer desensitization as a process that can explain how children\u2019s exposure to familial verbal aggression can undermine the development of the HPA axis and influence an individual\u2019s physiological response to subsequent conflict interactions, specifically conflict interactions between college-aged dating partners.  \nIn Chapter 3, I consider the proximal influences on the experience of conflict in romantic relationships.  I first describe the objectives of conflict.  Next, I review how conflict between romantic partners reflects and affects relationship well-being.  I then argue that it is important to consider proximal factors that impact the experience of conflict.  In particular, I hypothesize that the features of the conflict interaction and the qualities of the interactants shape the intensity of conflict experiences and influence an individual\u2019s physiological reaction to conflict with a dating partner.   \nIn Chapter 4, I discuss the concerns surrounding the measurement of a history of familial verbal aggressiveness and conflict, and I review the three most frequently utilized scales that measure a history of familial verbal aggressiveness and conflict, namely the Verbal Aggressiveness Scale, the Conflict Tactics Scale, and the Aggression Questionnaire.  In addition, I explain the appropriate precautions to take prior to the collection of cortisol, the proper procedures to use during the collection of cortisol, and the correct process for handling and storing cortisol samples.  Finally, I describe an empirical study designed to test the hypotheses previously posited.  \nI present the results of the dyadic interactive study in Chapter 5.  After describing a series of preliminary analyses, I report the substantive analyses and results that were conducted.  Structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures were used to test the relationships between stress reactivity, exposure to verbal aggression in familial conflict during childhood, conflict intensity, cognitive ability, and emotional competence.  The results of the analyses provided partial support for the hypotheses.  \nFinally, in Chapter 6, I discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the study for understanding the influence of a history of exposure to verbal aggression in familial conflict during childhood on subsequent conflict interactions.  I conclude by describing the strengths and weaknesses of the dissertation.

In many cases,  advanced HF is refractory to medical treatment and requires the use of more advanced treatments like heart transplantation or ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy.  Patients with advanced HF from all metropolitan statuses are being implanted with VADs,  yet the impact of different metropolitan statuses has not been adequately explored in the literature.  This study aimed to identify and examine outcome disparities between VAD therapy recipients and metropolitan status by comparing rural and urban VAD recipient outcomes in the first twelve months after implantation.  Secondary analysis of institutional data maintained by the Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) was completed.  VAD recipients were designated as rural or urban using county level data from the U.S. 2010 Census.  Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify differences in hazards between rural and urban VAD recipients.  Event counts were analyzed using negative binomial regression. The sample included 158 VAD recipients that were discharged from the hospital following VAD implantation.  Twenty-two recipients died in the first twelve months after receiving their device.  Nearly 81% of all recipients experienced at least one adverse event during the study period.  Although none of the Cox proportional hazards models achieved statistical significance, the Kaplan-Meier event curves seem to suggest rural patients may be at a disadvantage in terms of some adverse events associated with VAD implantation.   Until further research with more robust samples of VAD recipients is conducted, these findings seem to indicate no difference in VAD outcomes related to metropolitan status.  However, the VAD recipients in this study experienced many adverse events and hospitalizations that may impact HRQoL for VAD recipients irrespective of metropolitan status.  Management of complications is an ongoing concern for nurses caring for VAD recipients.  New strategies to prevent VAD-related adverse events and poor outcomes are needed.  Nursing clinicians and researchers are in a prime position to develop and test these new interventional strategies.

Two-phase flow through branching tees (T-junctions) result in pronounced hydraulic losses and uneven phase separation following the split of flow stream; ultimately causing profound effects on system performance and quality of delivered fluids. Current state-of-the-art modeling software available to oil and gas industry do not address uneven phase separation (route preference) issue and typically do not provide a distinct T-junction component for modeling purposes. A finite-volume (FVM) based two-fluid model has been developed for one-dimensional, steady-state analysis of two-phase flow split and uneven phase separation at branching T-junctions of natural gas networks using steady-state Euler equations and outlet pressure specifications. Based on a comprehensive review of available branching T-junction and phase separation models in the literature, and classification of modeling efforts included in this text, Double Stream Model (DSM) of Hart et al. (1991), essentially a\nmechanistic phase separation sub-model for low liquid loading conditions (holdup < 0:06), is applied at the junction control volume to capture uneven phase separation. In order to have a consistent model, phasic momentum equations are replaced with gas phase Bernoulli equations at the junction cell and required gas phase loss coefficients (K-factors) are calculated using Gardel correlations. Generalized Newton-Raphson method is applied for simultaneous solution of governing equations, for all the control volumes in the computational grid. Along with the staggered solution of governing momentum equations at CV edges, this allows accounting for the impact of outlet (downstream) pressures on flow split as well as closed-loop network applicability. Analysis is focused on regular, horizontal T-junctions with 90o branching angle. Results from air-water and hydrocarbon mixture studies are in agreement with literature; model captures pressure rise in the main line following\nthe flow split (the Bernoulli effect) and uneven phase separation with changing liquid flow rates and outlet pressures. An important observation is that while pressure in the main line right after the split (entrance pressure of the run) is always higher than the entrance pressure of the branch due to Bernoulli effect, this is not necessarily the case for run and branch outlet pressures. When branch outlet pressure is specified higher than the run outlet pressure, less fluid is diverted into the branch. However, the turning of flow causes branch entrance pressure to be always smaller than run entrance pressure. Slight difference in overall hydrocarbon mixture composition in run and branch arms, after flow split at the tee, suggests that for small holdup values compositional change can be ignored for practical purposes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1571], "author_name_tesi": "Alp, Doruk ", "last_name_ssi": "Alp", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Doruk", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Luis Ayala", "Turgay Ertekin", "Luis F Ayala H", "Robert W Watson", "Dr Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "John Harlan Mahaffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Luis Ayala, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Chair", "Robert W Watson, Committee Member", "Dr Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["uneven phase separation", "Branching", "tee", "T-Junction", "Double Stream Model", "Flow split", "Staggered Grid", "Finite Volume Method", "Two-Phase Flow", "Steady-State"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Fluid Properties on Geometric Complexity and Breakdown Pressure of Hydraulic Fracture", "id": "18148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydraulic fracture has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing extraction and recovery of hydrocarbons from conventional and unconventional geologic resources.

Only supercritical fluids access the highest stress concentrations at crack tip regions.

Inviscid flow solutions around an RAH-66 Comanche helicopter fuselage are performed to analyze the aerodynamics of ducted tail rotors in low-power, near-edgewise flow conditions. A numerical solution of the Euler Equations is obtained for the flow over the Comanche fuselage with a uniform actuator disk and blade element models for the FANTAILTM; the main rotor is excluded in this study. The solutions are obtained by running the PUMA2 computational fluid dynamics code with an unstructured grid with 2.8 million tetrahedral cells. PUMA2 is an in-house computer code written in ANSI C++. Excellent correlation between the calculations and a variety of static test data are presented and discussed. The dynamic relationship between the antitorque thrust moment and applied collective pitch angle is studied by changing the pitch angle input by five degrees at a rate of 144 degrees per second. Dynamic fan thrust and moment response to applied collective pitch in hover and forward flight are presented and discussed. \n\tIn order to remove the deficiency of the Euler equations in predicting separated flows, which is mostly the case in helicopter fuselage aerodynamics, a concurrent study is performed to simulate turbulent flows around three-dimensional bodies. Most of the turbulence models in the literature contain simplified assumptions which make them computationally cheap but of limited accuracy. Dramatic improvements in the computer processing speed and parallel processing made it possible to use more complete models, such as Reynolds Stress Models, for turbulent flow simulations around complex geometries, which is the focus of this work. The Reynolds Stress Model consists of coupling Reynolds transport equations with the Favre-Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations, which results in a system of 12 coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. The solutions are obtained by running the PUMA_RSM computational fluid dynamics code on unstructured meshes. Results for high Reynolds number flow around a 6:1 prolate spheroid, a sphere and a Bell 214ST fuselage are presented.\n\tFor the prolate spheroid basic flow features such as cross-flow separation are simulated. Predictions of mean pressure and circumferential locations of cross flow separation points are in good agreement with experiment. Most of the separation location predictions are in less than five percent discrepancy with measurements. The effects of the freestream turbulence intensity and turbulent Reynolds number are analyzed and discussed. A grid refinement study is performed to improve the computations. The fine mesh solution predicted locations of primary and secondary separation points with errors of roughly two and zero degrees, respectively. \n\tMean pressure and skin friction predictions for the sphere solutions are also in good agreement with the measurements. The computed separation location is very close to the measured one, the error is less than one degree. The distribution of turbulent stresses shows that the turbulent flow around a sphere is highly anisotropic and supports the notion that using anisotropic turbulence models are necessary for three-dimensional separated flows.\n\tFlow simulations around a Bell 214ST fuselage are performed for an isolated fuselage at three different flight conditions and helicopter with rotors modeled using momentum theory in forward flight. Predicted pressure and drag force correlate well with the wind tunnel data. For a high angle of attack case drag was able to be predicted with a less than ten percent error.

However, as the desired half-length of the massive hydraulic fracture increases, its effective half-length and level of confinement decrease while its associated cost increases. These aforementioned disadvantages become more pronounced in ultra-tight and naturally fractured formations, such as shale gas formations. On the other hand, Complex Wells (CW) are becoming an attractive alternative to MHFHW in unconventional formations. CW have an extended reach and advanced structures that increase their contact with the reservoir, thus enhancing their productivity. The field application of CW in unconventional formations is increasing, especially with technological advances in directional drilling and geo-steering. With such an increasing architecture complexity of CW and the heterogeneous nature of shale gas formations, a quick yet robust expert system is needed to predict their production profiles, analyze their transient data, and design their well configurations.\nDeveloping an analytical model to predict complex CW performance is an arduous task, especially in unconventional formations. In addition, the mere use of numerical modeling to design a well that matches a desired production profile requires significant time investment to model all possible scenarios and then to optimize. Furthermore, traditional well testing methods do not capture the complex interaction between CW and shale formations. In addition, they require manpower, equipment, a lot of time, and capital investment. However, the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) ability to recognize nonlinear relations that govern fluid flow in porous media and instantly predict results, makes it an attractive method. Therefore, in this study, several ANN are trained to perform three major tasks instantaneously. The first task is to predict CW performance of a given well configuration from a given shale gas reservoir. The second task is to predict the well configuration that will produce a desired production profile from a given shale gas reservoir. The third task is to predict the reservoir properties from a given production profile and well configuration.\nA commercial numerical reservoir simulator is used to generate a database to train, validate, and test the ANN used in this study. For each ANN, the database becomes the source of input and output parameters, which include production profiles, well design parameters, well operating conditions, and reservoir properties. A new database is generated for each task. All input parameters are randomly generated within their natural maximum and minimum values to build the reservoir simulation cases. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11263], "author_name_tesi": "Alqahtani, Mari ", "last_name_ssi": "Alqahtani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Luis Ayala", "Antonio Nieto", "Kultegin Aydin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Luis Ayala, Committee Member", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shale", "Shale Gas", "Reservoir Development", "ANN", "Unconventional Reservoirs", "Complex Wells", "Artificial Neural Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Space Diversity in Indoor Broadband Optical Wireless Communications", "id": "6086", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6718", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Wireless optical (infrared) link provides a secure and a promising alternative to radio for wireless indoor connectivity, be it for terminals or sensors. The large spectrum of unregulated band enables a link to provide broadband access needed for multimedia and other bandwidth demanding applications. The spatial confinement of infrared light provides interference-free bandwidth-reuse in adjacent rooms. The ability to create spatially independent channels in a small physical space holds the promise of large link capacity. \nThe main challenges in the design of an infrared link include: susceptibility to shadowing, multipath dispersion, and limited range resulting from noise generated by ambient light. Shadowing caused by benign objects blocking signal path results in service degradation, if not complete interruption. Configurations employing wide beam transmitter to service many receiver locations suffer multipath. Noise at receiver is generated by ambient light. Even in a uniformly lit environment, noise generated by natural and artificial light varies depending on receiver location and orientation. \nTo combat the adverse effects of temporal dispersion in high-speed applications, an accurate channel impulse response is needed. The impulse response is used to analyze and to compensate for the effects of multipath dispersion. In this work, a new approach for obtaining the channel impulse response is presented resulting in tremendous savings in calculation time and bringing insight into the channel behavior. \n\nThe ability to create spatially independent channels has motivated a new configuration called Multi-Spot Diffusing (MSD) configuration. In which, a transmitter acts as an array antenna, with each element transmitting data over an independent channel. A multibranch receiver is employed to receive independent copies of transmitted data through each of its branches. In our research, we analyze MSD link with the objective of determining the optimal number of branches that results in maximum signal-to-noise ratio, minimum probability of error and minimum outage probability.\nThe MSD configuration increases link capacity and reliability by providing a multi-input multi-output channel between transceivers. The availability of N spatial channels implies the possibility of increasing data rate by N folds compared to a single channel. In order to improve link reliability, our research considers novel spatial diversity coding techniques. In orthogonal spatial coding, each channel is responsible for carrying one of N symbols. The receiver decides on a transmitted symbol by comparing received signals on its branches and selects the branch corresponding to maximum signal. In another proposed scheme, a symbol is represented by N bit code word. Each bit is transmitted through a separate channel. The diversity receiver decides on a symbol that corresponds to the highest correlation with a received code word. Thus, information is transmitted not only through signal shapes, but also through branches that receive them.\nTraditionally, a non-directed non-line-of sight link configuration uses a ceiling as crossover between a transmitter and a receiver. In many practical environments, the ceiling is not available, either due to environment structure or poor reflectivity of ceiling surface. In this work, we propose and assess the feasibility of using a new configuration that relies on a wall\u2019s upper region as crossover. Both configuration are characterized and compared based on path loss and delay spread.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6714], "author_name_tesi": "Alqudah, Yazan A.", "last_name_ssi": "Alqudah", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Yazan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "John Metzner", "Shizhuo Yin", "Natarajan Gautam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optical Wireless Communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK BASED EXPERT SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF HORIZONTAL WELL IN A THREE-PHASE RESERVOIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS GAS CAP AND BOTTOM WATER DRIVE  ", "id": "rf55z768s", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13140", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The oil and gas industry is continuously trying to increase hydrocarbon\u2019s recovery in order to meet the high demand for energy in the world. Increasing the production rate of hydrocarbon compromises the lifespan of the reservoir. Throughout last decays, a number of processes have been developed in the oil and gas industry to increase the hydrocarbon recovery while minimizing their effect on the life of the reservoir. One of these techniques is the horizontal well drilling. This drilling method allows higher recovery of hydrocarbons by increasing the contract area between the casing and the oil zone. \nHowever, high production rate from the horizontal well will result in phenomenon called cresting. The time at which it occurs is called breakthrough time. The goal for any production engineer is to delay breakthrough time as much as possible. The delay of this time will result in increasing the lifetime of the reservoir by maintaining the natural driving forces represented by water drive and gas cap in the reservoir.\nIn this study artificial neural network is utilized to construct a reliable tool to predict the production profiles namely: oil rate, gas rate, water rate, cumulative oil, cumulative gas, cumulative water, gas oil ratio, water oil ration and water cut, that lies within the reservoir and design properties for this study. A synthetic three-phase reservoir with a gas cap and bottom water drive is constructed using a commercial reservoir simulator to simulate and validate. After that, 600 different scenarios were generated using a range of reservoir properties along with different depth at which horizontal well will be placed.  These different scenarios were used to train the ANN in order to make it predict the production profiles mentioned above within an error range of 5-15%. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to make this model user-friendly.

The main cause of water coning is the pressure drawdown near the wellbore. Producing a well in an oil reservoir with a bottom water drive will cause the original oil-water contact to rise towards the well in the shape of a cone. As production continues, the height of the cone increases. Once the water reaches the wellbore, the water starts to be produced and water production increases with time while the oil production decreases.\n\nThe first part of this thesis is concerned with the analysis of pressure transient data in an oil reservoir with edge water. A 3-D numerical model is used to generate pressure transient data for a vertical well. The reservoir is considered as a composite reservoir where the inner zone contains the oil phase, and the outer zone contains the water phase. Procedures are proposed to help estimate the distance to the discontinuity under certain conditions. These procedures can be applied using the derivative of the pressure buildup test data if the mobility ratio is less than unity. Some of the parameters that control the accuracy of the proposed analysis procedure are the producing time and the external reservoir radius. \n\nThe second part of this study is concerned with the water coning phenomena. Artificial neural networks are developed to predict water saturation around vertical and horizontal wells with a good accuracy in oil reservoirs experiencing a bottom water drive. The data used to develop the neural networks are from a numerical simulation model for reservoirs created using synthetic data. The neural networks have been found to effectively predict the change of water saturation over the time and show the development of the water cone. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4181], "author_name_tesi": "Alrumah, Muhammad ", "last_name_ssi": "Alrumah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Muhammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Robert W Watson", "Yilin Wang", "Li Li", "Savash Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Robert W Watson, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Li Li, Committee Member", "Savash Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composite reservoir", "water coning", "water saturation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Relationship between the Quality of Nurses' Work Life and Nurses' Work Engagement in Hospitals in the Eastern Provence of Saudi Arabia", "id": "14741zua3", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14741", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nNursing in Saudi Arabia suffers from staff shortages with a high turnover rate.

This practice can lead to microbial reservoir souring, which generates hydrogen sulfide via sulfate-reducing bacteria. Hydrogen sulfide adversely impacts the health and safety of employees, reduces oil quality and thus demands more processing requirements, corrodes pipeline and facilities, and plugs permeable formations. Reservoir souring costs the industry millions of dollars annually.\nLaboratory experiments that have been made to study microbial souring mechanisms and growth, while published mathematical models simulate and forecast the souring process. In spite of the diverse microbial communities in oil reservoirs, current studies have been limited to selective microbes that mostly include sulfate-reducers and nitrate-reducers. One of the processes that has not yet been considered is microbial iron reduction. Current reservoir souring studies narrow the impact of iron minerals to the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide, namely through abiotic reactions to precipitate iron sulfides. Studies show that ferric iron can exist as iron oxides in natural systems within clay minerals and coating grains, a fraction of which would be bio-available for microbial reduction.\nIn this research, we have utilized the published results of microbial experiments conducted in upflow porous reactors to comprehend microbial processes and growth parameters. We used CrunchFlow, a reactive transport model, to simulate those processes in seawater injection for 1D homogeneous media at various ferric iron concentrations, and 2D heterogeneous media where ferric iron distribution was correlated with permeability reduction. Random heterogeneous fields were generated using a Fast Fourier Transform simulator at differing correlation lengths and Dykstra- Parson coefficients.\niii\niv The analysis of microbial experiments by simulation indicate that microbial iron reduction\ninhibits sulfate reduction, imposing a delay on microbial souring by several pore volumes injected after seawater breakthrough. The results also show that higher concentrations of bio-available ferric iron would impose further delay on the microbial souring process in oil reservoirs. Formations with higher heterogeneity experience earlier hydrogen sulfide breakthrough than those that are more homogenous. In more heterogeneous reservoirs, the microbial reductions of sulfate and ferric iron are more isolated from one another than in homogenous reservoirs. Sulfate reduction prevails in permeable formations, while ferric iron reduction is limited to tight formations in which there are higher concentrations of iron minerals.\nOur research demonstrates the benefits of understanding potential microbial iron reduction and ferric iron bio-availability in oil fields.

Likewise, a manufacturing process or\nengineering system where the response of interest is the geometry of a product or\npart is said to have a shape response. A shape response can relate to a planar\n(two-dimensional) geometrical feature, or to a three-dimensional one. The overall\ntheme of this dissertation is the modeling and optimization of engineering processes\nthat have either a profile or a shape response. The models and methods described\nin this dissertation have application mainly in manufacturing, engineering design,\nand computer experiments.\n\nStatistical Shape Analysis (SSA) is a relatively new area within Statistics.\nTraditionally the realm of biological applications, it has been recently applied\nto manufacturing problems. D.G. Kendall, in pioneering work conducted in the\n1980\u2019s, defined the shape of an object as the geometrical information that remains\nonce certain similarity transformations, namely, rotations excluding reflections,\ntranslations, and dilatations (or dilations) are filtered out. His work is based on\na landmark representation of an object, where a landmark consists of the coordinates\nof a point measured on the object together with a label, with labels that\ncorrespond from object to object. This representation turns out to be relevant\nin manufacturing, since data obtained using a coordinate measuring machine will\ntypically have this appearance. Over the last 20 years, several SSA tests have\nbeen proposed to detect differences in the mean shape between objects, but little\nwork exists on the relative merits of these methods. The first part of this dissertation\nconsists of a comprehensive performance analysis of landmark-based tests\nfor mean shape differences. Since the performance of these tests depends on the\ntypes of shapes being tested, we consider both shapes that have been studied in the scarce extant literature on the subject, namely triangles and arbitrary polygons\nwith few landmarks, and also consider shapes of specific interest in manufacturing\napplications, such as circular and cylindrical geometries with tens to hundreds of\nlandmarks.\n\nAn additional problem studied in this dissertation is that of shape optimization,\nthat is, find the best operating conditions that lead to the most desirable shape\nof the product under fabrication. Previous tests for shape differences are based\non Kendall\u2019s definition of shape, which neglects differences in size between objects\nsince it removes dilation (scale) effects, and make up for this deficiency by testing\nseparately for differences in size. As an alternative, we present statistical tests for\ndifferences in form between the objects, where we define the form of an object as\nthe geometrical information that remains once the effect of rotations and translations,\nbut not dilations, is filtered out. We further develop a form optimization\nmethod when noise factors are present, proposing in effect a method for the Robust\nParameter Design problem for shape (form) responses. Noise factors are factors\nthat for the purpose of a carefully designed experiment are controllable, but that\nduring normal operation of a production process or during use of a product vary\nrandomly. The goal is to find the controllable factor conditions of the process that\nachieve a desired part form in the presence of noise factor variability.\n\nThe second part of this dissertation deals with profile response processes, their modeling, and subsequent optimization. Methods for this type of processes are mainly based on frequentist model estimation techniques, where the uncertainty in the parameter estimates is not considered during the optimization phase. As shown by J. Peterson, neglecting the uncertainty in the parameter estimates may lead to solutions that will very unlikely achieve the desired process performance. While there exist recent work in profile response systems where a Bayesian point of view is taken for model fitting that does incorporate the uncertainty of the model parameters into the subsequent optimization phase, those models are not flexible enough as they depend on a parametric regression model  that is required to fit the mean profile well. As a more flexible alternative to these prior approaches, we present new modeling and optimization methodology for profile response processes based on a spatio-temporal Gaussian Random Function (GRF) model. In this model, the space of the controllable factors corresponds to the ``space\" dimension, and the space of the locations over which the profile responses are observed corresponds to the ``temporal\" dimension. The temporal dimension may or may not be actually time in some applications since in general it is equivalent to the ``signal\" in Taguchi's signal response models. Similarly as in the first part of this dissertation, the goal here is to find controllable factor operating conditions that will lead to a desirable profile response with highest probability in the presence of noise factor variability.

Aerosol particles interact with water and form cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei; however, the effect of these interactions on climate are not well understood. Additionally, the heterogeneous chemistry of aerosol particles can affect atmospheric particle composition and ice nucleation activity. Particle size and local aerosol composition also have important implications for human health. Of particular interest are mineral dust particles as these particles may undergo long range transport after entering the atmosphere through desert winds. These particles can interact with other atmospheric pollutants, which may alter their surface properties. We investigated the adsorption of one such pollutant, acetic acid, on the surface of the mineral kaolinite before and after the addition of water vapor using Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS). To determine the conformation of the resulting adsorbates on the surface, we used molecular modeling to determine the theoretical frequencies of possible surface conformations. This research determined that the type of adsorbate on the surface of the treated particles varied with the addition of water as some conformations were more energetically stable in the presence of water than others.\nFurther work focused on water adsorption on the nanoscale and the energetics of water desorption. We studied the effects of surface defects on water adsorption on the surface of sodium chloride using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Temperature Program Desorption Spectroscopy (TPDS). This research provided insight into the energetics of how water binds to sodium chloride and how water binds onto water layers at cold temperatures. As the surface properties and composition of particles with good ice nucleation activity in the atmosphere are unclear, we also studied the immersion freezing activity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in order to determine whether ice nucleation occurred on the outer surface, inner pore, or edge of the carbon nanotube. Using additional characterization methods, we determined that freezing occurred inside the nanotube and that freezing began at different temperatures depending on the size of the inner diameter. This research provided insight into how soot and the spherules that comprise soot could be an effective ice nucleus depending on size. On the local level, we have studied the changes in atmospheric particle composition in University Park, PA before and after local power plants converted from coal to natural gas consumption. Particle measurements were taken fourteen times in a two-year period and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed in order to determine how particle composition changed and whether or not the number of fractal particles changed.

Though our understanding of the climate system has improved significantly over the past few decades, the impact of aerosol particles remains uncertain.  Aerosol particles can affect climate through the absorption and scattering of radiation (aerosol direct effect) and by serving as cloud condensation nuclei (aerosol indirect effect).  It is known that aerosol particles cause a net cooling effect on the planet, but the magnitude of cooling is unclear and remains under investigation.  A large part of this uncertainty is due to an incomplete understanding of the complex physical and chemical properties of aerosol particles such as composition, morphology, and phase state.\n\nIn this dissertation, we focus on investigating the role of particle size and composition in determining morphology.  We have discovered that for some organic aerosol systems, particle morphology depends on size, where small particles are homogeneous and large particles are phase separated.  To explore the origins of this size dependent behavior, we have worked with a model organic aerosol system, poly(ethylene glycol)-400 mixed with ammonium sulfate.  We have used cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy to probe the effect of phase separation mechanism on particle morphology by varying the organic aerosol composition.  Our results suggest that a size dependent morphology occurs due to an activated process, where the presence or absence of an activation barrier to phase separation controls the resulting morphology.\n\nWe have also explored the kinetics and thermodynamics of the phase separation process that results in a size dependent morphology by varying the experimental drying rates.  Drying rates that span over four orders of magnitude were investigated.  We have observed that at the fastest drying rates, the size of the transition region where both phase separated and homogeneous morphologies exist is on the order of ~100 nm.  At the slowest drying rates, the transition region shifts to smaller diameters and the width narrows to ~3 nm.  Our results suggest that a size dependent morphology persists to the slowest drying rates.  Thus, we conclude that an underlying thermodynamic effect results in this size dependent behavior, rather than solely a kinetic phenomenon.\n\nTo determine the atmospheric implications of a size dependent morphology, we have used a cloud condensation nuclei counter to probe the effect of a homogeneous vs. a phase separated morphology on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity.  We have found that the activation diameters differ for particles which have the same composition, but varying morphology.  \n\nSince aerosol optical properties are a sensitive measure of particle structure, we have studied the morphology-resolved optical properties of organic aerosol using cavity ring-down spectroscopy.  Our spectroscopy data indicate that the optical properties of core-shell and partially engulfed particles are approximately equal, but different than the prediction for homogeneous particles.  By accurately parametrizing aerosol particle morphology, optical properties, and CCN activity we will be able to better predict heterogeneous chemistry in the atmosphere, in addition to the aerosol direct and aerosol indirect effects which play a critical role in constraining climate forcing.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13985], "author_name_tesi": "Altaf, Muhammad Bilal", "last_name_ssi": "Altaf", "middle_name_ssi": "Bilal", "first_name_ssi": "Muhammad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Miriam Freedman", "Miriam Freedman", "David Boehr", "Raymond Schaak", "Eugene Clothiaux"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Miriam Freedman, Dissertation Advisor", "Miriam Freedman, Committee Chair", "David Boehr, Committee Member", "Raymond Schaak, Committee Member", "Eugene Clothiaux, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aerosol", "Organic Aerosol", "Transmission Electron Microscopy", "Morphology", "Phase Separation", "Cloud Condensation Nuclei", "Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy", "TEM", "Atmospheric Chemistry", "Climate", "Biogenic Aerosol", "Secondary Organic Aerosol"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Addressing Capacitance-Resistance Modeling Limitations and Introducing a New Practical Formulation", "id": "26570", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Capacitance-resistance modeling (CRM) has become a popular and convenient tool that is used to model production rates and assist in reservoir characterization. Upon successful modeling, engineers would be able to link reservoir injected volumes to respective production wells, quantify injection signal dissipation times, and qualitatively infer presence of no-flow barriers and fractures. Requiring only well rates and bottom-hole pressures as inputs, CRM is able to mimic streamline simulation when seeking injected fluid allocation, and help guide reservoir engineers to educated decision making. However, this nonlinear semi-analytical tool, due to its simplicity, comes with a few documented limitations. This study aims to build a robust capacitance-resistance model by both addressing modeling limitations, and introducing a new modeling equation. CRM limitations of extended producer shut-in times and new well introduction have been addressed by employing pseudo-injection rates. Aquifer influx cases are also successfully modeled by mapping influx rates to a new injector. If the aquifer influx cannot be modeled, the rates are inferred from the CRM's match quality, but are not a guarantee representation of actual aquifer influx rates. The limitation of highly compressible fluids, however, remains to be a modeling hurdle.\nThe new modeling equation encapsulates the compound heterogeneity effect on injection streams from near-producer and far injection-well volumes. The model is validated against a numerical reservoir simulator, and compared to another documented equation.

The research significantly contributed to the EFL (English as a foreign language) teacher education field and to the Saudi context more specifically by exploring and pinpointing EFL teachers\u2019 beliefs about reading instruction and connecting those to recent research on second language reading instruction. \n\nBased on the cognitive theory of reading, a survey of 81 questions was conducted, using a 5-point Likert scale, in order to determine teachers\u2019 degree of agreement and disagreement with a variety of different teaching practices in reading. Another goal was to examine whether teachers were more inclined toward one of the prevalent models of reading instruction: skills-based, whole language, and metacognitive strategy approach. The theory and application of these models are discussed, especially within the Saudi context and relevant literature. \n\nThe survey was distributed to 78 teachers in two large Saudi universities: King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences and Shugra University. Basic numerical analysis was used to determine the weighted means as well as the agreement proportions of their responses for each item on the survey; and bootstrap statistical analysis was employed to determine which reading instruction model was more dominant. \n\nFindings indicated that teachers favored the metacognitive strategy approach more than the others. Most teachers (81.7%) identified with the metacognitive strategy approach, while 70.6% and 63% chose whole language and skills-based approach, respectively. Moreover, the study included a micro examination of the teachers\u2019 responses within evidence-based major components of reading instruction.

These are as follows: help students acquire word recognition, gain reading comprehension, be aware of text structure, improve reading fluency, engage in strategic reading, and practice extensive reading. The study found out that teachers highly valued most of these skills except for reading fluency and extensive reading. The study connected this finding with current and relevant research on second language reading, illustrating why these two latter skills are neglected and underestimated; and looked at how teachers support their students\u2019 learning of all six skills by offering strategies and practices that enable their students to excel in their reading ability. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11825], "author_name_tesi": "Althewini, Abdulaziz  M.", "last_name_ssi": "Althewini", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Abdulaziz ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Anne Whitney", "Elizabeth A Smolcic", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Anne Whitney, Committee Member", "Elizabeth A Smolcic, Committee Member", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Saudi", "ESL", "EFL", "teacher", "teacher education", "English", "reading", "professional development", "belief", "foreign language"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "TESTING A MODEL OF FIRST-SEMESTER\nSTUDENT-ATHLETE ACADEMIC MOTIVATION\nAND MOTIVATIONAL BALANCE BETWEEN\nACADEMICS AND ATHLETICS\n", "id": "7827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2905", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examined the correlation between background demographic variables, high school academic variables, college situational variables, and noncognitive variables (independent variables), and academic motivation and the balance between academic and athletic motivation  (dependent variables) for first-semester student athletes competing at a highly competitive Division I athletic program.

Developmental influences of serotonin have been forthcoming in putting into perspective how alterations early in life can modify the trajectory of serotonergic circuitry involved in establishing adulthood emotionality. Studies presented in this thesis focused on investigating early life alterations in the function of the serotonin transporter (SERT), the substrate for current antidepressant treatments, using pharmacological and genetic mouse models. These studies provide information that is clinically relevant to antidepressant exposure during pregnancy and human SERT gene polymorphisms, respectively. Mice exposed to the serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants S-citalopram (S-CIT) and fluoxetine (FLX) during a critical postnatal development window and mice with constitutive SERT deletions were compared in terms of emotion-related behavior, physiology, and neurochemistry during late adolescence or adulthood. Findings indicate that postnatal administration of S-CIT but not FLX resulted in reduced anxiety, potentiated 5-HT1A autoreceptor responses, and reductions in extracellular serotonin levels in late adolescent and adult mice. By contrast, lifelong SERT deficiency was associated with increased anxiety, blunted 5-HT1A responses, and increased levels of extracellular serotonin at all ages examined. From these findings, it can be concluded that these two models of early SERT disruption produce dissimilar outcomes and warrant attention to determine the benefits and risks associated with the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy versus untreated maternal depression. Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR assays to determine mRNA levels of genes relevant to mood and anxiety disorders were developed and carried out. In the first study, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a complex gene associated with mechanisms of stress and antidepressant treatment, was studied in SERT-deficient mice. In the mouse, the Bdnf gene contains up to nine splice variants, all encoding the same mature protein, that can be differentially regulated by stress and/or antidepressant therapies. Findings show that SERT-deficient mice having increased anxiety and hypersensitivity to stress show reductions in total BDNF levels, as well as levels of splice variants containing Exons  I and V. A second study to investigate SERT expression in rhesus macaques with respect to a SERT gene polymorphism (5 HTTLPR) associated with enhanced anxiety traits in carriers of the short allele of this polymorphism was undertaken. Although functional changes in SERT (reductions in uptake) were observed with respect to short allele carriers, these changes were correlated with surface SERT expression but not SERT mRNA levels. Together, these studies suggest that while the serotonin neurotransmitter system is undoubtedly involved in the pathophysiology and treatment of emotional disorders, many complexities and questions remain to be addressed. Nonetheless, understanding developmental roles of serotonin provide a means to gain a better understanding as changes occurring during this period are sufficient to generate persistent alterations in serotonergic circuitry.
