One of the primary goals of student discipline is student development. Promoting student development within the current student conduct framework is difficult. One of the campus administrators who can help to promote student development within the student conduct process is the student conduct advisor. Little research has addressed the role of the student conduct advisor. This multi-method study examined the role of the student conduct advisor within an alternative dispute resolution framework. Alternative dispute resolution is the method of resolving disputes outside of the court context. Using the Guill (1997) framework for evaluating dispute resolution systems, student conduct administration analysis was done to provide a comprehensive view of student conduct processes. Then, examining the use of student conduct advisors at four-year, public institutions provided insight into how institutions view the role of the student conduct advisor.\n\nThe findings indicated that student conduct administration is a form of binding arbitration. Binding arbitration is an adversarial form of alternative dispute resolution. Findings from four-year public institutions revealed that 95% of institutions allow student conduct advisors and 70% of institutions allow attorney-advisors to accompany students through the conduct proceedings. These findings suggest that the role of the student conduct advisor must be taken into account and more closely examined at public institutions. These conclusions have implications for public institutions and how they define the role of the student conduct advisor. These findings highlight the continued\n\ndivision of how different entities believe the student conduct advisor should be used in student conduct proceedings. Suggested areas of future research include qualitative studies of students\u2019 perceptions of student conduct advisors\u2019 roles as well as more qualitative analyses on student conduct advisors at both public and private institutions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10037], "author_name_tesi": "Rohrbacher, Duane Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Rohrbacher", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Duane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dorothy H Evensen", "Neal H Hutchens", "Nancy A Welsh", "R"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dorothy H Evensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Neal H Hutchens, Committee Chair", "Nancy A Welsh, Committee Member", "R, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["student conduct", "alternative dispute resolution", "student discipline"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR AND GENETIC STUDIES OF CELLULAR REGULATORY MECHANISMS USING DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER AS A MODEL SYSTEM", "id": "6117", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4533", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Proper organismal development and cell survival requires integration of a number of signaling pathways and regulatory molecules.  Intracellular and extracellular molecules coordinate to regulate a number of cell functions including cell differentiation, proliferation and morphogenesis.  Many of these molecules and signaling pathways are highly conserved throughout evolution.  Due to this, studies in model organisms have been critical in defining the basic concepts that govern all cell functions.  This thesis focuses on using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system.  Drosophila has been an effective model system for nearly one hundred years helping to define the components necessary for processes such as neural and embryonic development.  We demonstrate three effective uses of Drosophila.  In the first study, we have identified an eye specific enhancer for the yan gene, a general inhibitor of differentiation.  In the developing eye, yan is required to inhibit neuronal differentiation until proper inductive signaling is initiated.  Analysis of the yan enhancer identified a regulatory mechanism involving the Notch pathway and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathway mediated by the Drosophila EGF Receptor (DER).  This model provides the first example where these two key pathways integrate in a competitive manner at the DNA sequence level.  The second study identifies patterning and degeneration defects within the Drosophila ovary caused by mutations in gp150.  In the eye, gp150 has been shown to be involved in regulating ommatidial assembly via interactions with components of the Notch pathway.  Analysis of gp150\u2019s expression pattern and mutant phenotype in the ovary indicate that it may be interacting with the Notch pathway in the ovary as well.  The final study uses the eye as a model to study cell proliferation.  We provide initial phenotypic characterization of a mutation in a novel tumor supressor gene.  Combined, these three examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Drosophila as a model system.  In particular, studies of the yan enhancer make a significant contribution to our understanding of the amount of integration required between major signaling pathways involved in cell development and differentiation.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4502], "author_name_tesi": "Rohrbaugh, Margaret C.", "last_name_ssi": "Rohrbaugh", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Richard W Ordway", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Esther Siegfried"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member", "Esther Siegfried, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosophila", "Yan", "Cell Cycle", "Notch Signaling", "Development", "Gp150"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Frontiers of Refinement: Border Crossings in the Early Republic Travel Narrative of Sally Hastings", "id": "13683sar191", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13683", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Westward expansion and frontier mythology figure prominently in the formation of early national identity and citizenship.  The role of genteel women travelers in this story, however, remains an understudied area of scholarship.  This study seeks to fill this gap by focusing on a little-known but fascinating early-nineteenth century woman travel writer, Sally Anderson Hastings (1773-1812).  Hastings chronicled her 1800 trans-Allegheny journey from her hometown in eastern Pennsylvania to a backcountry settlement near Pittsburgh in a book Poems on Different Subjects, to which is Added a Descriptive Account of a Family Tour to the West (1808).  This dissertation uses Hastings\u2019 life and writings as a case study to explore early westward settlement from the perspective of a genteel woman traveler.  Hastings was concerned with critiquing backcountry culture and society as she looked for refinement in the more rustic conditions.  Her writings therefore reflect the larger ideologies and beliefs that shaped her life and illustrate how women acted as cultural transmitters in settling the West.\n\nThis study examines Hastings\u2019 travel account as both a lived experience and a literary expression.  In the early chapters, I explore the physical challenges and social encounters Hastings described in her writings.  Hastings inventively used her narrative to create new identities for herself as a courageous adventurer, explorer, and survivalist that sometimes conflicted with idealized notions of early republican womanhood.  Then, in the later chapters, I look at Hastings\u2019 role as an author in context with women\u2019s literary and intellectual worlds.  As a published travel writer, Hastings entered traditionally masculine territory.  As such, I argue she used literary conventions in subversive ways to contribute to the cultural discourses of the time. Hastings thus carved out a public space for a woman\u2019s viewpoint on various topics, including women\u2019s education, literature, philosophy, and landscape aesthetics, despite her marginalized status.  In returning Hastings\u2019 voice to the historical record, this dissertation helps to complete the story of early national westward settlement and adds to our knowledge of women\u2019s intellectual lives in the Early Republic.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13836], "author_name_tesi": "Rohrer, Sheila Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Rohrer", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Sheila", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Haddad", "John Haddad", "Anne A.

As acidic waters flow overland, oxidation and hydrolysis reactions result in accumulation of ferric iron (oxy) hydroxide precipitates on soil surfaces. AMD barrens can become a source of further pollution if exposed acidic precipitates are not protected against surface runoff.\nIn 2006, a restoration experiment was conducted by our research group at a 50-year-old AMD barrens to determine whether vegetation could be established by altering, rather than removing, surface layers of acidic iron-rich precipitates at the site which is representative of other mining-degraded areas. In that study, three zones were distinguished by thickness and color of precipitate surface layers and by moisture content as influenced by depth to fragipan layers in underlying native soils. Acidic precipitates in experimental plots were amended in place by a one- time incorporation of lime and compost (top 15 cm) and a first-year oats nurse crop to improve growth of a sown reclamation seed mixture. Plant composition in the first, second, and fourth growing season consisted mainly of oats, sown species, and indigenous species, respectively. In all three zones, plots that received compost had greater than 70% vegetative cover at the end of the fourth growing season. The research presented in this dissertation builds on the investigation initiated in 2006 in the zone where subsurface AMD flow was most shallow and focuses on non- reclaimed (control) precipitates covered by mossy biological crusts and reclaimed precipitates sustaining vegetation.\nIron (Fe) biogeochemistry in AMD precipitates was studied to gain an understanding of potential losses of redox-active metals after plant-based reclamation. As mobility of redox-active metals can be increased by enhanced microbial activity in the rooting zones of growing plants, we compared the forms of Fe in the reclaimed and control precipitates five years post-reclamation. Since Fe is the most abundant metal in many mine drainages, root exudation by growing plants\ncould stimulate Fe(III)-reducing activity in rhizospheres, resulting in losses of soluble Fe(II) from the system. Precipitates were sampled from moist yet unsaturated surface sections (8-cm depth) excised from replicate plots. Four precipitate types, reclaimed root-adhering (RR); reclaimed below-roots (RB); control crust-adhering (CC); and control below-crust (CB) were obtained before selective-extraction analyses and microbial counts were performed. Reclaimed and control precipitates had mean Fe contents of 454 and 690 g kg-1, respectively. Ferrozine tests of extracts indicated that Fe(II) concentrations were three- to five-fold higher in reclaimed precipitates than in control precipitates. Organically bound Fe and amorphous iron oxides, as fractions of total Fe, were also higher in reclaimed than in control precipitates. Estimates of Fe-reducing and Fe- oxidizing bacteria were four- to tenfold higher in root-adherent precipitates than in both types of control precipitates, indicating a potential for increased Fe cycling in plant rhizospheres. Scaling up Fe measurements from experimental plots suggested that potential total Fe losses during the 5- yr period following reclamation were 45 t Fe ha-1 yr-1.\nMicrobial communities inhabiting AMD-impacted environments have been more extensively studied in aqueous rather than terrestrial systems. Our reclamation study provided the opportunity to gain insights into AMD-derived bacterial and eukaryotic communities in unsaturated, edaphic habitats. Precipitates of the same types as described for the Fe-biochemistry study (RR, RB, CC, and CB) were collected six years post-reclamation. At the time of sampling, all four precipitate types had similar pH levels (2.5-2.7) because reclaimed precipitates had gradually become more acidic following the one-time lime application in 2006. Bacterial and eukaryotic diversity were assessed using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA (V1-V3/V5 region) and the 18S rRNA (V4-V5 region) genes. Contrary to our projections we observed high bacterial and eukaryotic diversity across all samples.\nFor bacterial libraries, we recovered a total of 3,150 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity. Approximately 50% of these were exclusively found in reclaimed precipitates (RR, RB or both), 33% were unique to control precipitates (CC, CB, or both), and 6% were shared among the four precipitate types. Nineteen phyla were identified in the four type of precipitates and 13 of these were found in all samples. Proteobacteria comprised the most abundant representatives in reclaimed precipitates while Acidobacteria were more abundant in root-and crust-adherent precipitates. The latter sample also showed the highest abundance of Actinobacteria. The bacterial composition of incipient soils developed from AMD did not resemble those typically described for aquatic AMD systems. Among the classical AMD bacteria, only Leptospirillum ferriphilum, Leptospirillum ferrodiazotrophum, and Acidiphilium cryptum were detected in our study but at a very low frequency (\u2264 0.1% ).\nEukaryotic diversity was also higher in reclaimed precipitates than in control precipitates, reflecting the positive influence of plant establishment. Of the total 494 OTUs identified at the 95% similarity level, about 62% were found exclusively in reclaimed precipitates (RR, RB or both), 20% were unique to control precipitates (CC, CB, or both), and only 7% were shared among the four precipitate types. Since libraries from control precipitates were dominated by bryophyte sequences, these and other macroeukaryotic sequences were removed before calculating the percentages of microeukaryotic taxa in each precipitate. The main microeukaryotic taxa identified in reclaimed precipitates were Basidiomycota, 48% in RR and 39% in RB. In contrast, Ascomycota were more abundant in control precipitates, 50% in CC and 18% in CB, reflecting a shift in fungal community composition following reclamation. Many taxa reported to be abundant in water-impacted AMD habitats were either very low in abundance or not detected.\u2028These studies demonstrate how acidic precipitates containing redox-active metals respond to plant establishment in hydrologically sensitive environments and increase our knowledge of the microbial biodiversity in AMD impacted terrestrial environments. In addition, these findings help to identify microbial taxa that reflect development of edaphic habitats which could be indicative of reclamation success and restoration of soil ecosystem functions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8867], "author_name_tesi": "Rojas Alvarado, Claudia Macarena", "last_name_ssi": "Rojas Alvarado", "middle_name_ssi": "Macarena", "first_name_ssi": "Claudia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Carmen E Mart\u00ednez", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Rachel Alice Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maryann Victoria Bruns, Dissertation Advisor", "Carmen E Mart\u00ednez, Committee Member", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acid mine drainage", "iron oxides", "soil microbiology", "bacteria", "fungi", "microbial diversity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Are Ngos Making A Difference?

The number of NGOs in Nepal increased from 249 in 1990 to over 29,000 in 2010. However, this growth does not necessarily mean NGOs are effective at improving rural livelihoods. Despite their presence, rural areas have experienced little change. Furthermore, the lack of evaluative studies on the effectiveness of NGOs challenges claims of success made in their reports, which often feature testaments from local people on program success and are otherwise self-produced and not independent. Moreover, those independent evaluations conducted have too often, analyzed a single NGO or just one project of an NGO. Therefore, neither NGO reports nor prevailing independent research provide a comprehensive and realistic assessment of the impacts of NGOs on the communities in which they work.\nIn order to fill this gap, this research adopted a community approach to study the effectiveness of NGOs in Nepal. The community approach reflected the premise that local people\u2019s perceptions would better reflect the performance of NGOs in their community. The study was conducted in two rural village development committees (VDC is the lowest level administrative unit in Nepal) - Hatiya and Narayansthan- in Baglung district. The level of NGO activities in the past five years was used to identify selected VDCs. Analysis of key informant interviews (n=80), survey responses (n=265), and secondary data implied that NGO activities in the district were having mixed impacts in the communities where they worked. Positive impacts were limited to a single sector and to a small geographical area. Failures of NGO programs were common in both VDCs. Many of the implemented projects were abandoned once they ended or were poorly maintained. NGOs blamed local people for poor management, while the local people faulted NGOs for implementing short-term projects and discontinuing funding once they were completed. Furthermore, local people criticized NGOs for not making any efforts to fix failed projects.\nStudy findings indicated local people had mixed perceptions of NGOs with a majority expressing dualistic views. On the one hand, they praised the NGOs for their work; on the other hand, they criticized them for not addressing local issues, catering to needs of donors and political leaders, implementing short-term projects, and making money from the projects. The positive attitude reflected the view that \u201cit is better to have something than have nothing.\u201d An overwhelming number of respondents preferred government to NGOs for rural development efforts. However, a majority of the key informants suggested NGOs should collaborate with the government on development activities. They were aware that both NGOs and the government had strengths and weaknesses; therefore, collaborative efforts would benefit local communities. \nImplications from this study recommend using multiple methods to evaluate NGO activities. The findings indicate local people are the best source of information to measure NGO performance. Furthermore, the future of rural development depends on collaboration between the local people, NGOs, and the government. To achieve this, an interactional approach to rural development is recommended.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7395], "author_name_tesi": "Roka, Krishna ", "last_name_ssi": "Roka", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Krishna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert E Luloff", "James Craig Finley", "Leif Jensen", "Leland Luther Glenna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert E Luloff, Dissertation Advisor", "James Craig Finley, Special Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nepal", "NGOs", "Rural development", "Effectiveness"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "How Interactions Between Host Immunity And Bacterial Virulence Genes Affect Transmission Of Bordetella Bronchiseptica\n", "id": "14767", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Effective strategies to reduce infectious disease burden require a sophisticated understanding of the pathogenesis and life cycle of the targeted microbe. The perpetuation of bacterial pathogens follows a sequence of events that includes 1) entry into a host 2) replication and evasion of host immunity and 3) shedding and transmission to new hosts. Progression of pathogens through transmission cycles requires adaptations for survival and growth within specific host environments, as well as virulence factors that underlie disease processes. Most studies of bacterial pathogenesis give special attention to how virulence factors interact with host immunity to affect within host growth and disease, but overlook events during the initial phases of infection that facilitate entry into new hosts, and those affecting shedding and transmission to new hosts. Investigating how host-pathogen interactions affect entry and exit of pathogens from hosts during transmission cycles can generate a more holistic understanding of disease dynamics and provide new means for interrupting the circulation of pathogens throughout populations. \nThis thesis will examine how host immunity and bacterial virulence factors affect the transmission of Bordetella between hosts. The Bordetella genus comprises numerous species of respiratory pathogens, the most notable of which are the causative agents of whooping cough in humans, Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) and Bordetella parapertussis (B. parapertussis), and their ancestral species, Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica), which circulates widely among wild and domesticated animals. The pathogenesis mechanisms of Bordetella have been studied extensively and vaccines against B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica effectively protect the majority of individuals from severe disease (1). However, the vaccines are less effective at protecting immunized individuals against less severe manifestations of the disease (2). Therefore, despite far-reaching efforts to control Bordetella-related disease, current interventions have low efficacy in preventing transmission of Bordetella (2, 3, 4), prohibiting achievement of herd immunity and leaving susceptible individuals, particularly infants who have not yet been vaccinated and immunocompromised individuals, at risk for severe disease.\nThis work describes the development a reliable methodology for measure transmission of the B. bronchiseptica from infected mice to naive mice and demonstrates that Toll Like Receptor 4 is a central element of the immune response that affects the resistance of na\u00efve hosts to initial colonization, as well as the control of disease within the host and the intensity of bacterial shedding.  We also demonstrate that numerous virulence factors are required for transmission regardless and that certain virulence factors with negligible or subtle contributions to disease pathogenesis have significant and measurable contributions to transmission.\nAdditionally, this thesis seeks to shed light compelling and poorly understood aspects of transmission using Bordetella species as model bacterial pathogens:  (1) Are there determinants of shedding independent of bacterial burden? (2) What are the essential defense mechanisms at the mucosal interface? (3) How is disease related to transmission?\n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7502], "author_name_tesi": "Rolin, Olivier Yues", "last_name_ssi": "Rolin", "middle_name_ssi": "Yues", "first_name_ssi": "Olivier", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Peter John Hudson", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Mary J Kennett", "Andrew Fraser Read"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "Andrew Fraser Read, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella", "Virulence", "Transmission", "Immunology", "Toll Like Receptor"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GIRLS\u2019 FOOD PREFERENCES ACROSS MIDDLE CHILDHOOD: \nTRACKING OF FOOD PREFERENCES, AND THE RELATION BETWEEN FOOD PREFERENCES, ENERGY DENSITY, AND FOOD INTAKE\n\n\n", "id": "9139", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "882", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: To date, there is limited research on the study of children\u2019s food preferences using validated measures. Few studies have examined the longitudinal tracking of food preferences and whether energy density is predictive of food preferences in childhood. Only Birch (1979b) has demonstrated that food preferences predict intake in young children using a valid measure of preference, and it is unknown how this relationship changes as children age or whether individual differences emerge with age. \nObjective: The aims were to 1) examine the tracking of food preferences between ages 5 and 11; 2) assess whether energy density predicts food preferences in childhood; 3) replicate Birch\u2019s (1979b) original finding that preferences predict intake in children; 4) assess the longitudinal change in the preference-intake relationship between ages 5 and 11; and 5) identify individual differences in how the preference-intake relationship changes over time. \nMethods: Subjects include 197 girls from the Girls\u2019 Needs Study. Girls\u2019 preferences and intake of 10 palatable snack foods were obtained at ages 5, 7, 9 and 11 during a behavioral protocol designed to measure Eating in the Absence of Hunger (EAH; Fisher & Birch, 1999a; Fisher & Birch, 1999c). Girls\u2019 heights and weight were measured and used to calculate BMI z-scores according to CDC 2000 guidelines, dietary restraint was assessed using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and EAH total caloric intake, a measure of disinhibited overeating, was assessed.  \nResults: Average correlation coefficients for the sample indicated that food preferences at age 5 predicted preferences at ages 7 (mean r=34), 9 (mean r=.32), and 11 (mean r=.26). However, energy density did not predict girls\u2019 food preferences at any age. To identify the average predictive relationship between preference and intake, polyserial correlations between preference rankings and intake were performed separately for each girl. Average preference-intake correlation coefficients (P-ICCs) were r=.33, r=.43, r=.52, and r=.45 at ages 5, 7, 9, and 11, respectively. A Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed that the average P-ICC significantly increased over time (r=.33 to r=.43) and followed a curvilinear shape, peaking at age 9 (r=.52). A latent profile analysis revealed three patterns of change in the preference-intake relationship between ages 5 and 11: 1) preferences are consistently significant predictors of intake at all ages (mean r range: .37 to .55); 2) preferences are significant and increasing predictors of intake from 5 (mean r=.21) and 9 y (mean r=.48), but decline to  non-significance  at 11 (mean r=-.05);  3) preferences  are nonsignificant predictors of intake between ages 5 and 9 (mean r range: .07 to .14), but become significant predictors at age 11 (mean r=.61). Girls following pattern 2 had higher BMI z-scores and greater increases in dietary restraint over time than girls following patterns 1 and 3.\nConclusion: Our findings demonstrate that food preferences track across middle childhood. There was no evidence that, at least for these foods, preferences were predicted by energy density. On average, children\u2019s food preferences predicted intake across middle childhood and became a better predictor over time; however, there were individual differences in this relationship. For most girls, food preferences were a strong predictor of intake throughout childhood; whereas, for some girls, preferences no longer predicted intake as they entered preadolescence. Compared to the former, the latter group was heavier and had greater increases in dietary restraint and EAH in childhood.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [875], "author_name_tesi": "Rollins, Brandi Yvonne", "last_name_ssi": "Rollins", "middle_name_ssi": "Yvonne", "first_name_ssi": "Brandi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leann L Birch", "Leann L Birch", "Eric Loken"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leann L Birch, Thesis Advisor", "Leann L Birch, Thesis Advisor", "Eric Loken, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["food consumption", "food intake", "obesity", "energy density", "food preferences", "dietary restraint"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An investigation of restrictive feeding practices and children\u2019s temperament, food reinforcement, and eating behaviors", "id": "17488", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8300", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parents\u2019 use of restrictive feeding practices is counterproductive, paradoxically increasing children\u2019s intake of restricted foods and risk for excessive weight gain. However, there is very little evidence for alternative feeding practices that successfully limit children\u2019s intake of palatable snack foods. Most studies to date have taken a one-dimensional, unidirectional approach to the study of restriction, in which low restriction is compared to high restriction and children are viewed primarily as \u2018reactors\u2019 to parental restriction. Research is needed to identify feeding practices that are effective yet non-restrictive approaches to limiting children\u2019s intake of palatable snacks. In addition, evidence is needed regarding the characteristics of children who show greater susceptibility to the negative effects of restriction, for whom alternative practices are particularly needed. The aims of the current dissertation were to explore qualitative differences in parental restriction and evaluate individual differences in the effects of different profiles of restrictive feeding practices on children\u2019s eating behaviors and weight status. In Study 1, using a sample of 180 mother-daughter dyads, latent profile analyses revealed four qualitatively distinct profiles of restrictive feeding practices: low restriction, limit setting, moderate restriction, and high restriction; which differed based on their use of limit setting practices and intentionally keeping snack foods out of girls\u2019 physical reach. When  parental use of high or low restriction was coupled with lower inhibitory control, girls showed greater increases in weight gain and eating in the absence of hunger (EAH), a measure of dysregulated eating, from ages 5 to 7. In contrast, girls whose parents predominantly used limit setting displayed more modest, normative change in weight status and EAH regardless of level of inhibitory control. In preparation for Study 3, an experimental study in which we examined individual differences in the short-term effects of restricting children\u2019s access to a palatable snack food on their eating behaviors and relative reinforcing value (RRV) of this food, we adapted and validated an RRV of food task for use among preschool children in Study 2. For Study 2, children 3\u20135 years old completed the RRV of food task, during which they worked for access to palatable snack foods on a progressive ratio schedule where the amount of work increased after each reward was earned.  Our findings suggest that the RRV of food task is a valid and developmentally-appropriate measure for assessing the RRV of food among very young children. Study 3 replicated Fisher and Birch\u2019s (1999) study using a sample of 3\u20135 year old children, demonstrating that restricting children\u2019s access by limiting the amount of time a snack food was available increased children\u2019s intake of this food immediately after it became available to consume, and increased their positive comments, requests, and attempts to access this food while it was being restricted. When examining individual differences in the effects of restriction, greater increases in intake were observed for children with lower inhibitory control, with higher approach, who found the restricted food highly reinforcing, and who had previous experience with a more controlling form of parental restriction. Overall, the results of the present research illustrate that parents may use a variety of restrictive feeding practices in the home, and that the effects of restriction differ for different profiles of restriction used and children\u2019s own characteristics. These results have implications for interventions aiming to identify feeding practices that support the consumption of healthy diets and for limiting children\u2019s intakes of snack foods high in added fat and sugar.

Forest harvesting could facilitate climate-related species migration by creating conditions that favor the establishment of new species or result.  My research investigated the effects of simulated climate change on plant community composition, structure, and phenology in a 2007 mixed hardwood clear cut.  In 2009, I conducted 22 biweekly vegetation inventories in a two-factorial randomized block design experiment with treatment factors of 2&#730; air temperature warming and 20% increased precipitation, added weekly.  I measured the impacts of our climate treatments on species composition, percent cover, leaf area index (LAI) and phenology.  I used permutation multivariate analysis of variance (PerMANOVA) on the average cover of observed species over the entire season to assess the relationship between community composition and simulated climate change treatments.  LAI and percent cover of the entire community and of different growth forms were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA while community biodiversity, species richness, and phenological events were assessed using standard ANOVA for different growth forms.  \n\nThe overall and herbaceous community composition was influenced by water treatments (p = 0.05 for both) while the woody community responded strongly to the interaction of warming and precipitation (p = 0.03).  Woody community analysis using stem abundance showed a strong reaction to warming alone (p = 0.005) and potential canopy species composition may also be affected by a warming*precipitation interaction (p = 0.056).  In general, Shannon-Weiner biodiversity, evenness, and total or growth form species richness were not affected by our treatments.  During peak growing season, forb cover was lowered by precipitation treatment and woody vegetation increased as a result of warming treatment.  Total cover was generally lowered by a the interaction of warming and precipitation.  Percent cover of all groups during the entire growing season was affected warming and precipitation treatments, but the direction of effects was highly varied.  Large tree cover and LAI were higher in the spring in warmed treatments.  During this time period, the average day of leaf out on canopy tree species and tall forbs and the date of flowering for short forbs were advanced by experimental warming and may be the driving factors of increased spring LAI.  Our results indicated that young post-harvest forests may have different species assemblages, cover and phenology under climate change scenarios.

Central to understanding species distributions are concepts of the ecological niche.  Species range limits and landscape-scale species distribution are often thought to represent a species\u2019 fundamental niche, or the full range of conditions in which a species could exist.  However, local-scale species distribution is described by the realized species niche, which is influenced by biotic interactions such as competition.  This dissertation investigates how interactions between climate and competition during two key phases of tree life histories, establishment and growth, might affect species distribution in the eastern U.S.  Specifically, I focus on three aspects of realized niches and distribution modeling: 1) the importance of resolving climate data to the same spatial resolutions as observations of species distribution; 2) differences between the regeneration niches that constrain species distribution and the adult niches that are currently used to model species distribution; and 3) relative influence of climate and competition on the growth of five co-occurring species in the central Appalachians. The use of gridded climate data and adult species distribution for modeling potential habitat suitability may misrepresent the conditions necessary for successful species establishment.  Growth analyses also reveal that generalized and interspecific competition influence species\u2019 realized climate niches and may limit the ability of climate-growth relationships derived from one location to be used in other locations.  Current species distribution modeling approaches are flexible enough to incorporate realized species niches and biotic interactions.  However, these models need to be parameterized with empirical data that matches the temporal and spatial scales of species distribution observations, environmental drivers, and the desired scale of inference for predicting changes in distribution.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9941], "author_name_tesi": "Rollinson, Christine ", "last_name_ssi": "Rollinson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Douglas Alan Miller", "Eric S Post", "Laura P Leites"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Dissertation Advisor", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Member", "Laura P Leites, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["species distribution", "climate", "competition", "realized niche", "Appalachian Mountains", "scale", "temperature model", "distribution model"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Effect of fat content on physical properties and consumer acceptability of vanilla ice cream", "id": "dz010q04x", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12752", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past few decades, the food industry has been seeking to reduce the energy density of many products. Fat reduction is often pursued as a strategy to decrease the overall caloric content of foods, since it provides the highest amount of energy per gram (9 kcal/g), when compared to proteins and carbohydrates (4 kcal/g). However, fat-reduced products are often perceived to be of inferior sensory quality, when compared to the full-fat alternative.\nIce cream is a complex food matrix due to the coexistence of multiple physical phases: ice crystals, air bubbles, partially coalesced fat globules and a concentrated, highly viscous unfrozen solution. In ice cream, removal of one ingredient may affect not only physical properties but also multiple sensory characteristics that are important to consumers. Fat, in particular, contributes to texture, mouthfeel and flavor, in addition to serving as a structural agent supporting the other physical phases, in particular the air bubbles. Moreover, it contributes to the characteristic smoothness, dryness and melting rate of the products. Removal of fat from ice cream without replacement of solids has been shown to decrease sensory quality indicators, while the addition of ingredients to replace the fat has provided better results. However, the perfect replacement strategy has yet to be found. Previous work evaluating fat removal strategies has focused on changes in key sensory descriptors, with surprisingly little information available about consumer acceptability of reduced-fat products.\nIn this study, the effect of replacing fat with maltodextrin (MD) on selected physical properties of ice cream and on consumer acceptability were evaluated simultaneously. Vanilla ice creams were formulated to contain 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14% fat and 8, 6, 4, 2, and 0% maltodextrin, respectively. Physical characterization included measurements of overrun, apparent viscosity, fat particle size, fat destabilization, hardness and melting rate. A series of consumer acceptability tests were conducted, each with ~100 participants, to measure liking and intensity of various sensory attributes. The experiment was replicated three times. Data were analyzed using one-way Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a mixed model ANOVA for the physical and sensory data, respectively. Correlation analysis was used to assess relationships between consumer acceptability, physical variables and sensory attributes. Consumer tests were also conducted after 19 weeks of storage at -18\u00b0C, to assess changes in sensory acceptance due to prolonged periods of storage. Later, a discrimination test was used to determine the difference in fat content that consumers are able to discriminate among the products tested in this study. Results indicated that viscosity of the mixes decreased with increasing fat content and decreasing maltodextrin concentration. Fat particle size and fat destabilization significantly decreased with fat reduction. However, consumer acceptability did not significantly differ across the samples for fresh or stored ice cream. Even in the absence of significant differences, overall liking was correlated with slower melting rate in fresh ice cream. Following storage, ice creams with 6, 12 and 14 % fat did not differ in consumer acceptability compared to fresh ice cream. However, ice creams with 8 and 10% fat (and 6 and 4% MD), each showed a significant drop in liking score following storage by 2.8 and 5.7%, respectively. When asked to discriminate, consumers were unable to distinguish ice creams with 2% fat difference when maltodextrin was included in the formulation. A 4% difference was found to be discriminated when comparing 6% vs 10% fat ice creams but not for 8% vs 12% fat. Collectively, the changes in the physical structure of ice creams with fat contents ranging from 6 to 14% did not show evidence of gross changes in consumer acceptability for either fresh or aged ice cream.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12077], "author_name_tesi": "Rolon, Maria Laura", "last_name_ssi": "Rolon", "middle_name_ssi": "Laura", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ICE CREAM", "FAT REDUCTION", "MALTODEXTRIN", "CONSUMER ACCEPTABILITY"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Processing Speed Performance Predicts Structural Brain Indices in Multiple Sclerosis a Decade Later", "id": "28664", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Processing speed is one of the most commonly found cognitive deficits in multiple sclerosis.

The mechanism by which IGF-I regulates signal transduction, however, is currently undefined.  In this dissertation, we investigate the role of IGF-IR trafficking and subcellular localization in sustained Akt phosphorylation in OPs.  \nWe report the loss of IGF-IRs from the cell surface, with subsequent recovery during IGF-I stimulation.  Using multiple pharmacological inhibitors of receptor trafficking we show that cluster and internalization of the IGF-IR is required to promote Akt phosphorylation and that recycling is required to sustain Akt phosphorylation.  We also show that the IGF-IR co-localizes with recycling endosome markers, including the transferrin receptor and rab11, further suggesting a role for IGF-IR recycling.  Mathematical analyses predict a model of receptor trafficking consistent with our empirical data of sustained Akt phosphorylation through 120 min.  \nWe also report that integrity of cholesterol/glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains (CEMs), also known as lipid rafts, is required to promote IGF-I mediated Akt phosphorylation.  Based on these findings, we propose that the IGF-IR and its signaling proteins are localized within CEMs.  Membrane extraction with triton or sodium carbonate yield CEMs from OPs containing the classical rafting proteins caveolin-1 and flotillin-1.  Furthermore, the IGF-IR and PI-3K/Akt signaling proteins co-localize in these microdomains\n\tWe were further interested in determining the role of caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts that contain the protein caveolin-1, in OL biology.  We report that caveolin-1 protein expression increased during OL maturation.  Additionally, caveolin-1 localization within CEMs correlates with IGF-I stimulation.  We also show that the IGF-IR co-localizes with caveolin-1 at a stage of OL maturation when caveolin-1 is maximally expressed, and that the IGF-IR contains a caveolin binding motif that is conserved through evolution.  Analysis of brains from caveolin-1 knockout mice reveals aberrant expression of myelin- and OL-specific proteins.  The results of this dissertation support our hypothesis that IGF-IR trafficking and localization mediate the sustained phosphorylation of Akt in OPs, and elucidates a role for membrane microdomains in the regulation of IGF-I signaling.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5184], "author_name_tesi": "Romanelli, Robert John", "last_name_ssi": "Romanelli", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teresa Wood", "Sarah Bronson", "Steve Levison", "Mark Kester", "Shao Cong Sun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teresa Wood, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Chair", "Steve Levison, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Committee Member", "Shao Cong Sun, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["oligodendrocytes", "Akt", "signal transduction", "IGF-I", "lipid rafts", "caveolin", "receptor trafficking"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MICROSTEGIUM VIMINEUM INVASION IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIAN SLOPE, SEEP WETLANDS: SITE COMPARISONS, SEED BANK INVESTIGATION AND WATER AS A VECTOR FOR DISPERSAL", "id": "9598", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2025", "abstract_tesi": "The invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, was only recently documented in slope, seep wetlands of the Centre County region of Central Pennsylvania. M. vimineum can replace other vegetation within three to five years of arrival and increased dominance of M. vimineum has been associated with decreased plant diversity. Currently, there are no studies that address M. vimineum in slope, seep wetlands yet it is rapidly and extensively invading these wetlands. Slope, seep wetlands within the forests of the Ridge and Valley Province of Central Pennsylvania are considered to have an exceptional variety of native flora and fauna. Therefore, the abundance of M. vimineum in these habitats is alarming. Since M. vimineum it is able to germinate, grow and reproduce in a wide range of environmental conditions it is vital that we understand more about what site characteristics in slope, seep wetlands support M. vimineum growth, describe aboveground and seed bank floral diversity in wetlands with and without M. vimineum, and examine how seed could be transported into these wetlands. For this research study slope, seep wetlands with and without M. vimineum were compared from June 2008 to September 2008 from two different locales, called \u2018AgRidge\u2019 and \u2018I99\u2019 within the Centre County region of Central Pennsylvania. Each locale contained 3 sites with M. vimineum and 3 sites without M. vimineum.\n\nResults of a principle components analysis using environmental data of sites from the \u2018AgRidge\u2019 locale only revealed significant positive correlations between photosynthetically active radiation (tau=0.600) and the presence of M. vimineum, which supports the findings of others. M. vimineum can grow extensively in high light environments, including wetland habitats. There were no significant correlations between measured environmental variables and the presence of M. vimineum at the I99 locale, thus provoking questions related to propagule pressure. Future habitat studies like this one require an additional examination of propagule pressures, like site proximity to source populations of M. vimineum, in order to fully determine what suite of characteristics are correlated with the presence of M. vimineum.\n\nThe aboveground plant community in sites without M. vimineum was dominated by forbs whereas the sites with M. vimineum were not dominated by a single plant functional group. Results of the seed bank study from sites with and without M. vimineum indicated that greater percentages of M. vimineum seed germinated from seed banks of sites where the species was present aboveground, particularly from soil samples taken at a depth of 0-10 cm when compared to 10-20 cm soil depths. The 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm seed bank plant composition were very similar to each other but different from the aboveground composition as confirmed by the multiple-response permutation procedures (p=0.0001). Analysis of the seed bank compositions indicated that M. vimineum sites were dominated by sedges at the AgRidge locale and grasses at the I99 locale. Non- M. vimineum sites were dominated by forbs at the AgRidge and a combination of forbs and grasses at I99. It is very possible that different sampling times and the germination method used in the greenhouse were responsible for differences between the aboveground and seed bank compositions. Therefore, further studies of plant diversity in slope, seep wetland sites with and without M. vimineum should include a more detailed analysis of flora sampled several times over one growing season in order to compare aboveground and seed bank compositions. Additional studies are also needed to determine if sites with M. vimineum actually contain lower percentages of native flora and if an abundance of forbs renders some sites more inhabitable for invasive species.\n\nThe results of a seed dispersal study determined that M. vimineum seed travels via water and highlights the need for future landscape-scale dispersal studies closely examining propagule pressure and water conduits. In order to address control of M. vimineum in this region the mechanisms behind range expansion must be better understood. Therefore, source populations of M. vimineum, landscape contours, and water conduits need to be mapped to assist with the identification of currently unknown populations. By considering these variables in addition to environmental variables present on site which promote growth, it may be possible to locate sites at risk for invasion. Then, these areas can be monitored and populations eradicated earlier.\n\nOverall, this research provides foundational descriptions of M. vimineum in slope, seep wetlands of the Centre County region of Central Pennsylvania and sets the stage to address further questions about habitat suitability, seed dispersal, and control of M. vimineum. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2007], "author_name_tesi": "Romanello, Genevieve Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Romanello", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Genevieve", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Cole", "Charles Andrew Cole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Cole, Thesis Advisor", "Charles Andrew Cole, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microstegium vimineum", "slope wetlands", "habitat suitability", "seed banks", "seed dispersal"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF PERINATAL HYPOXIA/ISCHEMIA ON THE STEM CELLS AND PROGENITOR CELLS OF THE SVZ-DL IN VIVO", "id": "6390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4190", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hypoxic-ischemic (H/I) brain injury is a major cause of neurologic disability of the term and prematurely born infant.

The SVZs of P6 rats were examined between 2 and 48h of recovery from H/I.  Pyknotic nuclei and ISEL+ cells were present by 4h of recovery, peaked at 12h and persisted for at least 48h.   The pyknotic cells corresponded to TUNEL+ cells. Many active-caspase-3 + cells were also present at 12h and comprised 1/3 of the total TUNEL+ population.   Electron microscopy revealed that hybrid cell deaths predominated at 12h of recovery suggesting excitotoxic death. \nConsistent with excitotoxic death, m-calpain became activated as measured by Western blot analysis of fodrin cleavage, as early as 4h of recovery and persisted strongly to 48h of recovery.  Calpain can activate caspase-3 and a Western blot analysis of caspase-3 showed that active caspase-3 first became detectable at 8h of recovery, and peaked at 24h following the insult.  This corresponded to cell counts of active caspase-3+  cells which showed a near 5 fold increase at 24h. \nFew dying cells were observed in the medial SVZ, where putative stem cells reside, and no nestin+ medial SVZ cells showed caspase-3 activation.

Double immunoflourescence showed a 2 fold increase in the number of dividing PCNA+/nestin+ cells in the most medial region.

While current practice relies on a schedule-based approach, this method creates large periods of time where the vehicle is grounded, and not mission capable. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems strive to solve this problem by providing critical information to maintenance personnel based on the actual condition of the structure.\nIn this thesis, Nonlinear Structural Intensity (NSI) and Nonlinear Structural Surface Intensity (NSSI) based damage detection techniques were improved for metallic structures and extended to composite airframe structures. Several test beds were developed to facilitate experiments characterizing various types of relevant structural damage. These include an aluminum stiffened panel, integrally stiffened composite panels, and an OH-58D \u201cKiowa Warrior\u201d tail boom.\nMeasurement of NSI maps at sub-harmonic frequencies was completed on the aluminum stiffened panel to provide enhanced understanding of the physical mechanism behind the characteristic contact acoustic nonlinearity (CAN) mechanism. An energy \u201csource\u201d at an ultra-subharmonic frequency was localized within the damaged footprint for the aluminum stiffened panel, a result not explicitly shown in previous studies. Additionally, a different application for the formulation of SSI was developed. NSSI as formulated in the frequency domain had a higher signal-to-noise ratio (60 dB difference in noise floor), as well as a greater overall sensitivity to damage in the form of loose fasteners (11.6 dB increase). NSSI was also evaluated to determine the sensitivity to structural damping levels, and proved to be relatively independent of the damping condition present on the structure.\nA new detection metric relying on modulated wave spectroscopy was developed and implemented using the NSSI damage detection feature. This technique, denoted NSSI-MW, relied on the interaction between two interrogation waves (in the form of combinational frequencies) to form a more stable method for damage detection while still providing a high sensitivity to damage. Results comparing NSSI to NSSI-MW showed that the single-tone approach had a higher sensitivity to damage (43.1 dB detection strength), but required judicious selection of drive force levels and frequency. NSSI-MW was able to characterize the damage response with high detection strength (27.2 dB), but did not require optimization of force or frequency. The active NSSI techniques were also extended to composite materials, adding a level of complexity due to their construction (orthotropic / anisotropic designs), as well as the higher distributed damping present in the plate structures studied.  Each metric was able to detect damage in the form of a delamination in the bond line of the integral stiffener to a high degree of sensitivity.\nMeasurements transitioning NSSI and NSSI-MW damage detection metrics to an OH-58 tail boom flight structure showed promise for intensity-based health monitoring techniques to be applied to complex airframe structures. Consistent with measurements from both the aluminum and composite stiffened panels, NSSI was shown to have a higher sensitivity (45 dB detection strength) than NSSI-MW (22 dB detection strength) when detecting simulated damage in the form of a loose hanger bearing bracket. In addition, Both NSSI and NSSI-MW were shown to be more sensitive damage detection features than nonlinear metrics based solely on strain or acceleration.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4920], "author_name_tesi": "Romano, Peter Quinn", "last_name_ssi": "Romano", "middle_name_ssi": "Quinn", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Edward Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Health Monitoring", "Structural Dynamics", "CAN", "Contact Acoustic Nonlinearity", "Structural Acoustics", "Vibration", "Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURE-FUNCTION STUDIES OF HOMODIMERIC TYPE I REACTION CENTERS FROM AN ANAEROBIC AND AN AEROBIC BACTERIUM", "id": "12531", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The prediction, based on sequence data, that the aerobe Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum possesses a homodimeric Type I RC, which had previously only been found in anaerobic bacteria, poised the question of how this group of RCs has been modified in response to their respective oxic or anoxic environment.  The work described in this dissertation addresses that question by studing the RCs from the strict anaerobe Heliobacterium modesticaldum and the aerobe \u201cCa. C. thermophilum\u201d.  In the heliobacteria, the discovery of a second weakly bound FA/FB-harboring protein, named PshBII, broke the paradigm that defined Type I RCs in terms of a single FA/FB-harboring subunit.  This finding suggested that the electron donor to PshBI and PshBII, the interpolypeptide [4Fe-4S] cluster called Fx, was promiscuous and capable of reducing multiple acceptor proteins.  As a consequence of this hypothesis, PshBI and PshBII became semi-mobile members of the heliobacterial RC (HbRC):  first accepting electrons from the HbRC, then dissociating from the complex and acting directly as ferredoxins in downstream metabolic processes. The promiscuity of Fx was confirmed by the discovery that this iron-sulfur cluster directly reduces cyanobacterial flavodoxin (Fld), a soluble redox protein.  Unexpectedly, PshBI and PshBII inhibited Fld reduction, a phenomenon that can be explained based on the competition for the electron on reduced Fx and which supports the role of PsBI and PshBII as semi-mobile members of the HbRC.   In \u201cCa. C. thermophilum\u201d, a homodimeric Type I RC was isolated that retained much greater activity under oxic conditions than the HbRC.  The \u201cCa. C. thermophilum\u201d  RC consisted of a core PscA homodimer and several subunits of a novel carotenoid binding protein (CBP), which gives the RC an unusually high carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio.

A large, light-induced bleaching at 840 nm is ascribable to the primary donor.  Isolated RCs that were depleted in CBP content showed reduced activity under oxic conditions.

Low steady state levels of ROS are maintained by enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms.  Under extreme environmental conditions, ROS production can overwhelm the detoxification systems and oxidative stress results.  ROS can oxidize methionine (Met) residues to methionine sulfoxide (MetSO) thereby inactivating enzymes or tagging proteins for hydrolysis.  The enzyme peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase (PMSR) reduces MetSO to Met, repairing damaged proteins.  The MetSO-PMSR-Met system has been referred to as the \u201clast chance\u201d defense mechanism against ROS.  The role of PMSR in protection against oxidative stress is well recognized in bacteria, yeast and animal cells; however the function of PMSR in plants is yet to be fully established.  The objective of this research was to determine the role of PMSR in the response of plants to oxidative stress.  One family of PMSR proteins, PMSRA of Arabidopsis was used as a model system. Arabidopsis has five PMSRA genes being expressed in different organs.  PMSRA1 to PMSRA3 are cytosolic proteins, PMSRA4 is plastidic and PMSR5 is secreted.  PMSRA4 transcript is the most abundant; PMSRA2, PMSRA3 and PMSRA5 are highly expressed in roots and stems; PMSRA1 is abundant in flower buds; and PMSRA4 is up-regulated by ozone, methyl viologen, cercosporin and high light.  Kinetic analysis of recombinant enzyme showed that PMSRA4 had twice the kcat and was four times more efficient (kcat/Km) than PMSR3. Transgenic plants over-expressing PMSRA3 and PMSRA4 were more resistant to methyl viologen and ozone.  PMSRA3 over-expressing plants were more resistant to cercosporin and PMSRA4 over-expressing plants more resistant to high light.  Transgenic plants with low levels of PMSRA4 were susceptible to oxidative stress in the chloroplast.  Treatments that lower PMSRA4 levels in wild-type plants, such as Mn2+ excess, increased the susceptibility of plants to oxidative stress damage (e.g. a modest 2-day water deprivation in plants grown under Mn2+ excess induces toxicity). PMSRA activity is essential for plant survival to oxidative stress.  It appears that specific isozymes protect discrete cellular compartments.  PMSRA4 is the most abundant and most efficient PMSRA in Arabidopsis and protects against oxidative stress derived from different cell compartments", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2217], "author_name_tesi": "Romero-Angulo, Hernan Mauricio", "last_name_ssi": "Romero-Angulo", "middle_name_ssi": "Mauricio", "first_name_ssi": "Hernan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ming Tien", "Eva Joy Pell", "Hong Ma", "B Tracy Nixon", "Teh Hui Kao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ming Tien, Committee Chair", "Eva Joy Pell, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["methionine sulfoxide reductase", "PMSR", "Arabidopsis", "oxidative stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Dog Owners' Perceptions and Behaviors Related to the Disposal of Pet Waste in City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks", "id": "15315aib10", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The presence of dog waste is an issue that is of significant concern to park managers.

The study built upon one of ISTE\u2019s (2003) essential conditions for integrating technology in education: technical assistance for using technology. Through a review of relevant literature, an argument was made for the study based on a lack of understanding around peer technical assistance with prospective teachers in teacher education programs. \n\nThis study used social network analysis (Reeves, 2008; Kleinberg, 1998) to find the participants who offer instructional technology assistance to many of their peers. By combining technology and superhub, the word \u201ctechnohub\u201d was used as a label for the participant population. The study identified the following research question: What is a technohub\u2019s lived experience of assisting peers with instructional technology issues in teacher education courses? A theoretical framework provided a starting point to explore technohubs\u2019 lived experiences by combining the current tensions in teacher education, teacher and technology leadership, and sociocultural and social theories of how people learn. \n\nTo address the research question, the study drew from transcendental (Husserl, 1913/1982; Moustakas, 1994) and hermeneutic (Heidegger, 1927/1962; van Manen, 1997) strands of phenomenology to create a Neo-Vygotskian methodological orientation.

I focus on Quaternary magmatism within the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER), which is concentrated in extensional faults belts on the rift floor, specifically - the Wonjii Fault Belt and the Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone. The location of these Quaternary eruptives within presently active extensional fault belts of the MER, presents the opportunity to deduce the primitive source(s) of rift magmatism, probe crustal structure and assess the role of magmatism in continental rifting. Mass balance of bulk rock & phenocryst composition and thermodynamic modeling of mafic lavas from both zones of extension indicates heterogeneity between the two extensional fault belts in the MER. Fractionation occurs at a shallower level (~1 kb) beneath the Wonjii Fault Belt in comparison to the Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone, where fractionation occurs at various levels in the crust (<1\u201335 km). Shallow fractionation of the Wonjii Fault Belt lavas is consistent with calderas observed along the belt (e.g. Kone, Gedemsa) that are largely absent from the Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone, where explosive maars associated with basaltic eruptions are more common. Given the strong association between these extensional fault belts and magma facilitated crustal modification (e.g. dyking, calderas), the sub-aerial distribution of Quaternary volcanism outlines the spatial distribution of lithospheric modification attendant to rifting and extension in central Ethiopia. We present lithospheric xenolith data that clearly show magmatic intrusions in the lithosphere beneath these active zones of extension, supporting geodynamic models of magma-assisted rifting. The broadly basaltic composition of these lithospheric xenoliths confirms the important role of mafic volcanism in modifying crustal structure. The Debre Zeyit and Butajira volcanic zones exhibit non-overlapping 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb ratios (0.7038-0.7045, 15.57-15.60 in Debre Zeyit; and 0.7036-.7038, 15.54-15.56 in Butajira). While other isotopic systems do not exhibit such variation (143Nd/144Nd 0.51261-0.51283, Debre Zeyit and 0.51278 to 0.51282, Butajira; 206Pb/204Pb 18.15-18.58, Debre Zeyit and 18.17-18.52, Butajira; 208Pb/204Pb 38.38-38.60, Debre Zeyit and 38.17 to 38.45, Butajira). The ubiquitous signature of the Afar Plume in Quaternary volcanism throughout the region supports magma assisted rifting models. However, a depleted mantle signature is observed in southern samples (Butajira), indicative of intrusion into the SCLM prior to the current episode of volcanism. This intrusion of depleted mantle derived melt into the lithosphere may reflect decompression melting due to the northward propagation of the MER, suggesting that the widespread influence of the Afar plume may be a more recent phenomenon. Combining these observations with existing geophysical data, I present a new geodynamic model for rift evolution in Ethiopia. This model associates processes active to the northeast of the Boru-Toru Transfer Zone with the Afar Depression and incipient seafloor spreading. To the southwest, continental rifting dominates and extension occurs in tectono-magmatic belts close to the rift margins with an overall orientation similar to the rift border faults. Within the framework the Wonjii Fault Belt is considered the southward propagation of the Red Sea Rift while the Silti-Debre Zeyit Fault Zone represents the northward propagation of the Main Ethiopian Rift.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6255], "author_name_tesi": "Rooney, Tyrone O.", "last_name_ssi": "Rooney", "middle_name_ssi": "O.", "first_name_ssi": "Tyrone", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Rudolph Parizek", "Tanya Furman", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "David H Eggler", "Derek Elsworth", "Barry B Hanan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Rudolph Parizek, Committee Member", "Tanya Furman, Committee Chair", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Member", "David H Eggler, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Barry B Hanan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ethiopia", "continental rift", "Debre Zeyit", "Butajira", "Wonjii", "geochemistry", "fault belt", "cinder cone", "basalt", "xenolith", "crustal structure"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF CELL ADHESION MOLECULES AND MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES IN OSTEOSARCOMA METASTATIC POTENTIAL\n\n\n", "id": "9067", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "432", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nOsteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone cancer and the second greatest cause of cancer related death in children behind blood cancers. The American Cancer Society reports that the five year survival rate of patients with metastatic osteosarcoma is 30% even with the use of adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Although, in the last 30 years there has been significant improvement in osteosarcoma of the extremities, 30-40% patients relapse within three years. Even though the use of adjuvant and neo- adjuvant chemotherapy beginning in the 1980\u2019s has increased survival, progress has since plateaued.\nWork presented in this thesis specifically focuses on the role of integrin induced matrix metalloproteinases in OS metastasis. We hypothesize that the integrin-MMP expression feedback loop is a mechanism whereby metastasizing osteosarcoma cells can produce specific proteolytic enzymes required for invasion. This model predicts that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to different ECM proteins will result in the expression of different MMPs by the OS cell. To test this hypothesis, we have developed osteosarcoma lines that express high and low levels of the &#945;2 integrin subunit.  Our results demonstrate that loss of the &#945;2 integrin subunit results in de-repression of MMP 1 and MMP 3 when grown on non-matrix substrate (plastic) and matrix substrates (fibronectin and collagen). Our data suggest a relationship between integrin ligation of specific ECM proteins and subsequent changes in MMP protein expression.\nSecondly, we hypothesize that the metastatic potential of OS is influenced by the type and amount of integrin receptors present on osteosarcoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we have evaluated the integrin profile of two osteosarcoma cell lines of low (SAOS-2) and high (LM7) metastatic potential. We found that the metastatic sub-line LM7 has lower alpha 5 integrin subunit levels when compared with the non-metastatic parental SAOS-2 cell line. This reduced alpha 5 integrin subunit expression may implicate this integrin in the metastatic process of osteosarcoma. Further, we also present data on MMP expression in the SAOS-2 parental cell line compared with the LM7 cell line. In this study, we show that the LM7 cell line expresses significantly less MMP 2 when plated on plastic and matrix substrates. Reduced MMP 2 expression in the LM7 cell line may suggest aberrant MMP 2 regulation in osteosarcoma metastasis.\nFinally, due to the lack of osteosarcoma cell lines, we have isolated and partially characterized a primary osteosarcoma cell line from a patient diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome called Penn State University-Osteosarcoma-Marfan syndrome (PSU-OS-M). We have selected for tumor cells without chemical or viral induction unlike most of the OS research cell lines available. The PSU-OS-M cell line was successfully cultured in vitro and the cells were shown to exhibit attachment independent growth and loss of contact inhibited growth when cultured on plastic (hallmarks of transformation). We hope the establishment of this osteosarcoma cell line will better reflect human osteosarcoma. Since mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene are responsible for Marfan syndrome, we evaluated fibrillin-1 expression. Using immunoflorescent analysis, we observed reduced fibrillin deposition but normal fibronectin deposition in the PSU-OS-M cell line. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [426], "author_name_tesi": "Roopnariane, Adriana  P", "last_name_ssi": "Roopnariane", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Adriana ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy M Ritty", "Timothy M Ritty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy M Ritty, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy M Ritty, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Matrix Metalloproteinase", "Osteosarcoma", "Integrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Reflection to Action: A Grounded Case Study of an Intentionally Designed Racial Justice Curriculum", "id": "7164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1716", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study addresses the problem of enlisting support from the white majority to combat racism. Innovative educational interventions are needed within higher education to promote the development of racial justice allies. Racial justice allies are individuals of the white race who purposefully project attitudes and actions that promote positive interracial interactions in an attempt to eliminate race-based inequality (Reason, Roosa Millar, & Scales, 2005). \nThe research illuminated how an intentionally designed racial justice curriculum influences the racial justice ally development process during college by addressing the following questions. How do white, undergraduate students at a predominantly white institution experience an intentionally designed racial justice curriculum? And, how do these educational interventions influence their racial justice ally development? \nThe qualitative paradigm of this study consists of a case study research design and data collection methods, and a grounded theory approach to analysis. The data is presented in the voices of the nine participants who richly describe their attitudes, values, and influential learning experiences related to racial diversity, race relations, and racial justice occurring before and during college. From the emergent themes and sub-themes, the influences of a racial justice curriculum on racial justice ally development are revealed. The racial justice curriculum consists of two formal educational interventions, SOC 119 and SOC 300, which contain various learning contexts. \nThe results of the study revealed that a complex set of influences contribute to the racial justice ally development of white students experiencing an intentionally designed racial justice curriculum. The following concepts play a predominant role in this process: the developmental complexity/intercultural maturity of the learner; an invitation from a trusted other providing an opportunity to participate in racial justice activities; and the distinctive educational conditions found within the varying learning contexts of SOC 119 and SOC 300 i.e., support from others and racial justice role models; \u201cminority\u201d experiences; interracial interactions and racially diverse friendships; and the opportunity to practice varying degrees of racial justice action. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1702], "author_name_tesi": "Roosa Millar, Elizabeth Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Roosa Millar", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert D Reason", "Lisa R Lattuca", "Regina Deil Amen", "Susan Ruth Rankin", "Margaret Ann Lorah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert D Reason, Committee Chair", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Member", "Regina Deil Amen, Committee Member", "Susan Ruth Rankin, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["racial justice ally", "student development", "race relations", "intergroup dialogue", "qualitative research", "social justice"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "BRANDING LEED\u00ae TO MILLENNIALS : A CONSUMER-ORIENTED APPROACH TO THE MARKETING OF GREEN BUILDING CERTIFICATIONS", "id": "14838yur107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14838", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research intends to systematically investigate, analyze, and make recommendations on how LEED\u00ae (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) as one of the most successful eco-brands, can be strengthened to build a greater impact in fulfilling the U.S. Green Building Council's mission, \u201ca prosperous environment that improves the quality of life for all.\u201d \nThe prevalent concern for the environment has caused expansion of green certifications and labeling programs covering different products such as consumer packaged products, electronics, and home appliance. Similarly, the building industry has witnessed the emergence of rating systems, certifications, and eco-labels such as EPA\u2019s ENERGY STAR, USGBC\u2019s LEED\u00ae. Among others, although the view that eco-labels are brands is not unanimously held, this thesis argues that well-known eco-labels such as LEED\u00ae have come to represent themselves as brands because they are capable of motivating consumers and influence their behaviors in the market. \nThe theoretical foundation of this research is built on the notion of consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) as one of the most dominant concepts in mainstream marketing academic research which indicates that consumers are the ones who decide the success, failure or economic impact of any brand. Green buildings\u2019 certifications and labeling programs are voluntary environmental programs and they have a market-driven approach which means their success is dependent on gaining sufficient traction from the players in the market, from high-stakes investors to end-users. Building a stronger brand can increase the likelihood to attract a consumer\u2019s favorable response and in long-term, it will increase the demand for certified-buildings.\nHowever, certification organizations often direct their marketing programs and advertising campaigns towards business owners, real estate investors, architects, and contractors to eventually deliver healthier products to end-users. In the meantime, the role of the end-users as the consumers of green spaces and their responses to the environmental brand are largely disregarded. In the case of LEED\u00ae, there is a shortage of comprehensive branding guidelines for direct business to consumer purposes. For the long-term success of USGBC\u2019s mission, my thesis is that there is a necessity to target end-user consumers especially of the younger generation also known as Millennials. \nWith the objective of providing branding recommendations that resonate with Millennials, the wide array of USGBC\u2019s efforts in managing the LEED\u00ae brand were studied. In these examinations, several data sets are collected, including analyzing journals\u2019 advertisements, social media, information from ad agencies, and conducting interviews with the director of the Brand Management team of USGBC. Through a systematic review of existing knowledge on Millennials and their environmental concerns, the attitudes and priorities of Millennials are analyzed and compared with the efforts of USGBC to form recommendations specific to this clientele. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16205], "author_name_tesi": "Roostaeian, Yasaman ", "last_name_ssi": "Roostaeian", "first_name_ssi": "Yasaman", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ute Poerschke", "Ralph Angelo Oliva", "Loukas N Kalisperis", "Lisa Domenica Iulo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ute Poerschke, Thesis Advisor", "Ralph Angelo Oliva, Committee Member", "Loukas N Kalisperis, Committee Member", "Lisa Domenica Iulo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Consumer-based brand equity", "Marketing", "LEED", "USGBC", "Millennials"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS WITH INFORMATIVE PRIORS\n\n", "id": "7965", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6228", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Latent class analysis (LCA; Goodman, 1974; Lazarsfeld & Henry, 1986) is frequently used in the social and behavioral sciences to identify and model latent classes composed of similar cases in multivariate categorical data.

Bayesian methods, an exciting perspective that is gradually beginning to make its way into the social and behavioral sciences (Howard, Maxwell, & Fleming, 2000; Raftery, 1995; Western, 1999) allow the incorporation of additional information gathered from other sources into an analysis thereby providing flexibility with sample size requirements. This prior information is based on what (we believe) we already know based on theory and prior empirical evidence. This additional information may help establish identification and reduce parameter bias in LCA, particularly when sample sizes are relatively small. LCA with informative priors is a practical approach for assisting with parameter recovery and model identification particularly with samples that are small relative to the size of the contingency table and model complexity. \t\n\nThis dissertation is divided into two manuscripts with the purpose of describing LCA with informative priors and demonstrating its usefulness using data on disordered eating and substance use.

The study participants were nine students enrolled in an undergraduate class focused on group development and learning skills for working with groups in social work practice. The study critically examines culture and spirituality as a worldview and draws on perspectives of culture and spirituality from adult education and social work education through the theoretical lens of poststructural feminist thought, intersectionality theory, and the discourses of critical multiculturalism and antiracist education. The framework for the study attends to positionality, power relations, and systems of privilege in the context of teaching and learning. A critical action research design was used to systematically look at knowledge production by introducing change and observing the effects. The main data collection methods were focus groups, reflective journals, and online asynchronous discussions. \nThe findings from the study are presented in the context of the planning, acting, observing, and reflecting stages of the action research cycle and address three major themes. First, participants moved beyond Christianity as the only valid spirituality, to understanding the spirituality of others and themselves as influenced by culture. Second, they indicated new learning about cultural competence for social work practice by connecting spirituality with culture, and understanding the effects of culture and White privilege in their own and other\u2019s real life experiences. Third, participants found the culturally responsive educational experience extremely positive because it foregrounded multiple dimensions of their learning: the spiritual, cultural, affective, and experiential, as well as rational work typical in higher education.  The themes and findings are discussed in light of the five elements of poststructural feminist thought: knowledge construction, shifting identity, voice, positionality, and authority. In addition, there were several implications from the study for the fields of adult education and social work including: the importance of hearing others\u2019 voices, the value of group process, the importance of ongoing support, value of creating space, and the value of technology. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6390], "author_name_tesi": "Root, Vicki ", "last_name_ssi": "Root", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vicki", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Senel Poyrazli", "Stephen Robert Couch", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Senel Poyrazli, Committee Member", "Stephen Robert Couch, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Culturally Responsive Education", "Social Work", "Action Research", "Group Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "All the King's Greeks: Mercenaries, Poleis, and Empires in the Fourth Century BCE", "id": "16882", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8341", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines Greek mercenary service in the Near East from 401- 330 BCE.

The feast of Corpus Christi was probably the most significant tradition to come from medieval Eucharistic devotion.

This is the transport operator that if directly inverted on the once-collided fixed particle source produces, without the need for an iterative procedure, the converged limit of the scalar fluxes for the iterative procedure. The asymptotic properties of this operator\u2019s elements have then been investigated in homogeneous and periodically heterogeneous limits in one-dimensional and two-dimensional geometries. The thesis covers the results obtained from this asymptotic study of the matrix structure of the discrete integral transport operator and illustrates how they relate to the iterative acceleration of neutral particle transport methods. Specifically, it will be shown that in one-dimensional problems (both homogeneous and periodically heterogeneous) and homogeneous two-dimensional problems, containing optically thick cells, the discrete integral transport operator acquires a sparse matrix structure, implying a strong local coupling of a cell-averaged scalar flux only with its nearest Cartesian neighbors. These results provide further insight into the excellent convergence properties of diffusion-based acceleration schemes for this broad class of transport problems. In contrast, the results of the asymptotic analysis for two-dimensional periodically heterogeneous problems point to a sparse but non-local matrix structure due to long-range coupling of a cell\u2019s average flux with its neighboring cells, independent of the distance between the cells in the spatial mesh. The latter results indicate that cross-derivative coupling, namely coupling of a cell\u2019s average flux to its diagonal neighbors, is of the same order as self-coupling and coupling with its first Cartesian neighbors. Hence they substantiate the conjecture that the loss of robustness of diffusion-based acceleration schemes, in particular of the Adjacent-cell Preconditioner (AP) considered in this work, in the presence of sharp material discontinuities in periodically heterogeneous multi-dimensional problems, is due to a structural deficiency of such low-order operators since they ignore cross-derivative coupling. This conjecture has been successfully verified by amending the AP formalism to account for cross-derivative coupling by the inclusion of matrix elements that account for the coupling of a cell\u2019s average flux to its first diagonal neighbors. Preliminary results of the Fourier analysis for the novel acceleration scheme indicate that robustness of the accelerated iterations can be recovered by accounting for cross-derivative coupling.

The sensor works by ZnO surface depletion due to charge trapping adsorbates from O3 (i.e. O2-). The low power consumption of these sensors is due to a 25 milliseconds recovery via ultraviolet (UV) light pulse per 40 seconds on a light-emitting diode (LED) of 365 nm wavelength which desorbs charge traps, removes the surface depletion and resets the sensor to its baseline current. Reliable properties for optimum sensor performance include good sensitivity for small concentration ranges of target gas, good electrical stability when unexposed to target gas, and good target gas selectivity. In addition to showing very good sensitivity, these sensors show very good electrical stability after post-deposition annealing of ZnO and partial-contact passivation, leaving the ZnO sensing area open to ambient, which also shows negligible hysteresis and improves the electrical charge transport of the as-deposited ZnO. Finally, a path to attain gas selectivity is via the use of an organic film, such as indigo dye, as a filter deposited over the gas sensors is demonstrated. Due to its low power sensor operation, it provides a path for energy harvesting applications.\nAmong other types of materials with potential transistor based sensor applications are transition metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2).

A reliable etching process is shown via reactive ion etching (RIE) towards layer-by-layer etching, where the etch rate of both chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown and exfoliated TMDs differ significantly. By taking advantage of the knowledge of device preparation for ZnO thin film transistors (TFT) and the etch rate recipe of TMDs, device fabrication of TMD based transistors can be reliably prepared by patterning the TMD film and acquiring the desired TMD film thickness for device performance. The RIE process consists of using argon (Ar): tetrafluoromethane (CF4) plasma, which is useful for fast patterning, and O2 plasma, which is primarily beneficial for slow and controllable layer-by-layer thinning of the TMD film after patterning.

Novel phenomena have been found, including the possible formation of an electron droplet state in the electron glass in highly disordered ultrathin Bi films prepared by quench deposition, a metallic state with an energy gap in disordered Au0.7In0.3 thin films, and a magnetic-flux induced superconductor-normal metal (S-N) transition in doubly connected ultrathin cylinders.\n\n<p> Amorphous Bi films prepared by quench deposition were studied in situ. These films exhibited a two-dimensional (2D) superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) as the film was made increasingly thicker, consistent with previous studies. In superconducting Bi films, a crossover from linear to nonlinear behavior was observed in the current-voltage (I-V) characteristic in the transition regime. The results are analyzed within the context of current-induced vortex-antivortex unbinding. Unlike the standard treatment, a finite cutoff length in the logarithmic interaction between vortex-antivortex pairs is taken into consideration. The implications of this interaction on the 2D SIT are discussed.\n\n<p> In subsequent studies, unexpected behavior was found in quench condensed Bi films deep in the insulating region, i.e. at the initial stage of film growth. A positive temperature coefficient of resistance (dR/dT >0) emerged as the temperature was lowered, with the resistance reaching a minimum before the expected negative dR/dT was obtained. This behavior was accompanied by a nonlinear and asymmetric I-V characteristic. As the film became thicker, conventional variable-range hopping was recovered. The crossover in the electrical transport properties is attributed to an amorphous to granular structural transition. The behavior in the amorphous phase is discussed in the context of the formation of metallic droplets within the electron glass.\n\n<p> In superconducting Au0.7In0.3 films, which can be modeled as a random array of superconductor-normal metal-superconductor Josephson junctions, a magnetic field-induced metallic state was observed. The metallic state, characterized by a temperature-independent resistance, was found at temperatures much lower than where a substantial drop in resistance occurred. Whereas non-linear I-V characteristics were found in the superconducting state, ohmic behavior was present in the metallic state. However, tunneling studies indicated that an energy gap, similar to the superconducting energy gap, is present in the metallic phase. The implications of these observations are discussed.\n\n<p> Finally, electrical transport measurements in ultrathin doubly connected superconducting cylinders of Al confirmed theoretical predictions of a destructive regime, characterized by the loss of global phase coherence in the zero-temperature (T=0) limit. The phenomenon occurs in samples with diameters smaller than the T=0 superconducting coherence length, in applied magnetic flux of half-integer superconducting flux quanta (Phi_0 = hc/2e). In the destructive regime, a broad drop in resistance was also observed, suggesting the presence of superconducting fluctuations. Features in the resistive transition near this regime suggest that the loss of superconductivity is associated with the formation of normal metal bands.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4257], "author_name_tesi": "Rosario, Mari-Anne M", "last_name_ssi": "Rosario", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Mari-Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ying Liu", "Jainendra Jain", "Peter E Schiffer", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ying Liu, Committee Chair", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mesoscopic superconductors", "electrical transport in thin films", "disordered superconductors", "Superconductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Deterministic Modeling of the Corrosion of a Low-Carbon Steel by Carbon Dioxide and the Effect of Acetic Acid.", "id": "9551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4843", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current work is carried out with the aim of developing a deterministic model of the corrosion of low-carbon steel by carbon dioxide including the effect of acetic acid.

The Point Defect Model (PDM) is used to describe passive film processes using fundamental chemical reactions and physicochemical properties of the metal-film-solution interface. The underlying mechanisms for describing currents, thicknesses, impedances, and structures are based on the defect chemistry of the layers formed on the metallic surface. \n\nEllipsometry Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Focus Ion Beam (FIB) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) are used to determine the nature of the layers formed on the metallic surface.

The PDM accounts for most of the experimental observations on the structure and behavior of the films formed on the metallic surface predicting the dissolution of the oxide layer adjacent to the metal surface when the outer layer resistance is similar in magnitude to the applied potential; this is supported by experimental findings from FIB and SEM. The porosity of the outer layer, the electric field strength across the barrier layer, the polarizability of the barrier layer/outer layer interface and the standard rate constants for the point defect generation and annihilation reactions at the barrier layer interfaces, and other parameters, are found to be independent of the applied potential. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4820], "author_name_tesi": "Rosas-Camacho, Omar ", "last_name_ssi": "Rosas-Camacho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Omar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Digby D Macdonald", "Chao Yang Wang", "Luis F Ayala H", "George Engelhardt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Dissertation Advisor", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Member", "George Engelhardt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrochemical Impedance", "Point Defect Model", "CO2-corrosion"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Predictors of maternal feeding practices, infant growth, and obesity risk", "id": "27219", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11969", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tMaternal feeding practices in infancy are important for the development of children\u2019s eating behaviors, growth, and obesity risk. Certain groups, such as first-time mothers, may be particularly vulnerable to using feeding practices that are inconsistent with current evidence-based feeding guidance. The purpose of the present research is to extend our knowledge of predictors of maternal feeding practices and their association with infant growth and obesity risk. The sample consisted of mothers participating in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II) and Year 6 Follow-up Study (Y6FU), a national longitudinal study of maternal feeding practices across the first year of life and at 6 years old. Data were collected approximately monthly across the first year of life and once again when the children were 6 years old. The aim of Study 1 was to describe differences between first-time and multiparous mothers in demographics, feeding practices, infant sleep, fussiness, and infant growth trajectories across the first year of life. Findings revealed that first-time mothers were more likely than multiparous mothers to report their infant was fussy and to use a number of feeding practices inconsistent with current guidance on infant feeding. Firstborns, despite being lighter at birth, surpassed later-born children at 7 months for weight-for-age z-scores. The aims of Study 2 were to use latent class analysis to identify distinct patterns of dietary exposures at 9 months, identify predictors of those patterns, and test the association between these dietary patterns and maternal and child weight outcomes at 1 year postpartum. Five classes of dietary patterns were identified: Breastfed, Fruits and Vegetables; Breastfed, Low Variety; Formula, Fruits and Vegetables; Formula, Low Variety; and Mixed, High Energy Density. The 5 dietary patterns differed in a number of maternal and child characteristics such as maternal parity, and childcare. The Mixed High Energy Density class had the highest probability of child overweight at 1 year among the latent classes. Study 3 utilized the 5 patterns of dietary exposures identified in Study 2 to test whether patterns of dietary exposures at 9 months were associated with differences in child diet and weight outcomes at 6 years. The class that most closely followed AAP infant feeding recommendations (Breastfed, Fruits and Vegetables) was most likely to meet the dietary guidelines for fruit and vegetable intake at 6 years. Infants in the Mixed, High Energy Density class had a high probability of consuming fried potatoes, and SSBs at 6 years and being overweight at 6 years. Taken together, these findings emphasize infancy as a critical period for mothers to develop nutritious and age-appropriate feeding practices to promote healthy growth and reduce obesity risk. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11410], "author_name_tesi": "Rose, Chelsea Michele", "last_name_ssi": "Rose", "middle_name_ssi": "Michele", "first_name_ssi": "Chelsea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Savage Williams", "Leann L Birch", "Alison Diane Gernand", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Ian M Paul"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Savage Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Leann L Birch, Dissertation Advisor", "Alison Diane Gernand, Committee Member", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member", "Ian M Paul, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["childhood obesity", "infant feeding practices", "individual differences"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigating the role of social and emotional competencies as predictors of problem behaviors among a sample of South African youth", "id": "17380", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8316", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adolescent substance use and delinquency are important problem behaviors to prevent because they increase the likelihood of future negative outcomes such as criminal activity, risky sexual behaviors, and substance dependence. Although these behaviors are known to co-occur, these behaviors are usually studied separately. Understanding the psychosocial correlates of SU and delinquency, such as social and emotional competencies (SEC), can guide the development of effective preventive intervention programs in high risk contexts. The current study identified patterns of co-occurring SU and delinquency among a South African adolescent sample and examined the roles of gender, age, and social and emotional competencies in predicting these patterns. The current study analyzed survey data collected from the control group sample of a randomized effectiveness trial of the HealthWise: South Africa program (N=1,953; Mage=16.7 years; 55% female, 93.6% Coloured). Latent class analysis (LCA) with covariates and multiple-groups LCA were employed using SAS PROC LCA. Four patterns of SU and delinquency were identified: Abstainers had low probabilities for all SU and delinquency behaviors; those in the Gateway Drugs class reported high probabilities of having used alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana in the past month; those in the Aggressive Gateway Drugs class had high probabilities of past month alcohol and cigarette use and hurting someone; and the Multiple Problems class consisted of those with high probabilities of using gateway drugs and involvement in all delinquency behaviors in the past month. Gender differences were found in the prevalence but not types of patterns. For both genders, older age was associated with an increased likelihood of membership in the Gateway Drugs and Multiple Problems groups and a decreased likelihood of membership in the Aggressive Gateway Drugs group, relative to the Abstainers group. Higher levels of self-reported anger management, decision-making, risk management, and conflict resolution skills were associated with decreased likelihood of membership in all problem behavior groups relative to the Abstainers group, for both genders. Study findings provide a more complete picture of adolescent problem behaviors and highlighted potentially high risk groups.

Developing a better understanding of how the metabolic processes of this organism respond to electron acceptors could provide useful insights for improving BES performance and bioremediation techniques. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) are five important metabolic cofactors representing reduction potential and cellular energy. These cofactors were analyzed in G. sulfurreducens cultures using fumarate, Fe(III)-citrate, or  anodes poised at varying redox potentials as the electron acceptor. In addition, reactors started with anode potentials poised at 210 mV vs Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) and then switched to 110, 10, or &#8722;190 mV (versus SHE) or open circuit were compared to reactors started directly at 110, 10, or &#8722;190 mV (versus SHE). \n\tResults showed that cellular redox potential given by ratios of reduced to oxidized NAD and NADP were similar when growing under all anode potentials tested and with Fe(III)-citrate, which is also believed to be reduced extracellularly, as the electron acceptor with an average of 0.088 \u00b10.022 (NAD) and 0.268 \u00b10.098 (NADP) for all conditions. However, both ratios were significantly increased when fumarate was provided as the electron acceptor, with values of 0.331 \u00b10.094 (NAD) and 1.955 \u00b10.369 (NADP). Energy potential of the cell represented by adenylate energy charge (AEC), an aggregate ratio of ATP, ADP, and AMP that accounts for all phosphoanhydride bonds, was maintained near 0.47 under almost all conditions tested. The reactor started at 110 mV maintained an AEC of 0.63 \u00b1 0.03, which Bonferroni-corrected t tests showed was statistically different from the AEC for the reactor started at &#8722;190 mV and fumarate reducing cultures (0.47 \u00b1 0.003 and 0.047 \u00b1 0.02, respectively).  Anode-growing biofilms demonstrated a significantly higher ATP/ADP ratio relative to cells growing in suspended culture on fumarate or Fe(III)-citrate. Reactors started at 210 mV and then switched to different anode potentials showed similar NAD(P) ratios and AECs as reactors started at 110, 10, or &#8722;190 mV.  \n \tThese results indirectly show that metabolic mechanisms regulated by the ratios of reduced to oxidized NAD and NADP are altered significantly between G. sulfurreducens cultures growing with extracellular and intracellular electron acceptors but that energy potential represented by AEC is not significantly altered. However, the ATP/ADP ratio and specific cellular ATP concentration increased during biofilm growth, suggesting a need for increased levels of ATP to maintain the biofilm. Analysis of reactors with anode potentials posed at 210 mV that were put into open circuit for 15 to 17 hours shows that G. sulfurreducens maintains similar reduced to oxidized NAD and NADP ratios as well as AEC when electron acceptors are or are not available. Overall anode potential has little effect on these important metabolic ratios, and specific electron acceptors only appear to affect these ratios based on whether they are intra or extracellularly.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4607], "author_name_tesi": "Rose, Nicholas Dean", "last_name_ssi": "Rose", "middle_name_ssi": "Dean", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["NADP", "BES", "MFC", "MEC", "Cofactors", "ATP", "ADP", "AMP", "Adenylate", "NAD", "AEC", "nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide", "Geobacter sulfurreducens"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Governmentality, the Grid, and the Beginnings of a Critical Spatial History of the Geo-coded World\n", "id": "6981", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5329", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In many cities and towns throughout the world today, the numbering of houses has become such a commonplace practice of local government that its everydayness makes it hard for urban inhabitants to even imagine living without these inscriptions that make up the abstract spaces of everyday life. Yet, as a spatial practice, house numbering is a comparatively recent phenomenon, which did not become widespread until the second half of the eighteenth century. So taken-for-granted has the house number become that few geographers have examined the history of house numbering from a critical perspective. This is particularly surprising given the recent interest in understanding the intersecting \u201caxes\u201d of knowledge, power, and the production of space. Drawing upon extensive archival research, this study brings together the theoretical insights of governmentality studies and Marxian geography to explore the history of house numbering in U.S. cities and towns in general while also providing a case study of the spatial politics of street and house numbering in New York City. I argue that the ordering of space was a key strategy to contain the dialectical processes of capitalist urbanization within the fixed order of logic and number.

Constructed in two parts, this dissertation is simultaneously a fictional graphic novel and a series of eleven essays and writings that emerge from the graphic novel.  As a work of educational research, this dissertation seeks to understand how comics and cartooning function as a form of inquiry and research; to explain how cartooning constructs new knowledge; to explore the embodied practice of making comics as a contribution to the growing field of comics studies; and to widen the boundaries of what knowledge, learning, and research look like, so that other teachers, researchers, artists, and students might find these practices large enough to participate in. \n\tThe graphic novel, The Well-Dressed Bear Will (Never) Be Found, was inspired by a series of pedagogical moments, most of which involved drawing comics with children in various educational settings. This comic uses text and image against one another to explore the arbitrary relationship between signifier and signified. The artistic style, formatting, and narrative all work to complicate attempts by the reader to come to a stable, enduring interpretation. Instead, this comic asks the reader to remain open and shifting, to discard metaphor, and to experience the comic metonymically instead: through intensities, sensations, and tentative conceptual convergences. Both the making and the reading of this comic simulate the sensation of navigating complex and contradictory educational spaces: classrooms, schools, lessons, and activities. The essays and writings that diverge from this comic recontextualize the concepts and ideas of the comic into the settings from which they originally emerged, using cartooning as a lens through which to construct new understandings regarding teaching, learning, and being in the world. \n\tBroadly, this dissertation constructs a \u201ccomics consciousness\u201d or a specific way of existing in the world as informed by the practice of cartooning. A comics consciousness, as theorized in this research, consists of a particular ontological and epistemological orientation. Making comics\u2014like engaging in any art practice for a sustained period of time\u2014begins to function as a lens through which one sees and constructs the world. As a cartoonist working in fragmented, unregulated, imaginative medium, I have begun to see the world and my pedagogy as one that privileges the ambiguity of fragmentation, embraces the subversion of working outside mandates and expectations, and experiences the impossible as though it were real. A comics ontology suggests that what exists is all that can be observed and felt, what can be imagined, and what is unimaginable but emerges through drawing. A comics epistemology suggests that we come to know what exists through the rational logic of observation, the irrational logic of sensation, the reconfiguring of what it is known into new possibilities, and the drawing of the unimaginable. We come know what is true by thought, feeling, imagining, and drawing.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9756], "author_name_tesi": "Rosello, Jarod ", "last_name_ssi": "Rosello", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jarod", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kimberly Anne Powell", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Christine M Thompson", "Charles Richard Garoian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kimberly Anne Powell, Dissertation Advisor", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Member", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["comics", "cartooning", "pedagogy", "arts-based research", "curriculum"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AN EXAMINATION OF THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT AND ATTITUDES TOWARD CONCUSSION IN HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES, COACHES, AND ATHLETIC TRAINERS", "id": "8053", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focus of the first portion of the study (i.e., the pilot study) was to develop a comprehensive and psychometrically-sound measure\u2014the Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitude Survey (RoCKAS)\u2014of knowledge about and attitudes toward concussion and to use the measure in the second portion of the study (i.e., the main study) to examine relationships between concussion knowledge and attitudes in high school athletes, non-athletes, coaches, and athletic trainers (ATCs).  \nThe pilot study included 698 high school students recruited from six high schools.  Content validity, face validity, construct validity, and test-retest reliability were established for the RoCKAS.

Additionally, a sample of 142 high school athletic directors was recruited to obtain information about concussion incidence rates.\nA statistically significant moderate correlation between concussion knowledge and attitudes was identified when all participants were analyzed together.  ATCs were found to have the highest knowledge and safest attitudes followed closely by coaches, and the students showed substantially lower levels.  No differences were found between athletes and non-athletes on either knowledge or attitudes.\nSchools with larger enrollment were found to be more likely to employ an ATC than smaller schools.  However, regardless of whether an ATC was on staff, at least 50% of coaches reported being the primary decision maker about return to play after concussion at both practices and games.  No differences were found when concussion incidence rates were compared across schools with and without an athletic trainer on staff.

The problem of accurate sound level prediction requires careful inclusion of all mechanisms that a&#64256;ect propagation, in addition to correct source characterization. Terrain, ground type, meteorological e&#64256;ects, and source directivity can have a substantial in&#64258;uence on the noise level.

The model is a hybrid of two numerical techniques: the parabolic equation (PE) and fast &#64257;eld \nprogram (FFP) methods, which allow for physics-based inclusion of propagation e&#64256;ects and ensure the low frequency content, a factor in community impact, is predicted accurately. Extension of the hybrid model to a pseudo-three-dimensional representation allows it to produce aviation noise contour maps in the standard \nform. \n\nIn order for the model to correctly characterize aviation noise sources, a method of representing arbitrary source directivity patterns was developed for the unique form of the parabolic equation starting &#64257;eld.

In the Rocky Mountain province of the western United States, recent high-resolution seismic imaging of the crust and upper mantle reveals intriguing correlations between mantle velocity anomalies and regions of high topography.  To determine whether these regions of low-seismic wavespeed are associated with recent changes in buoyancy structure of the lithosphere, I explore the relationship between the longitudinal profiles of tributaries draining the western slope of the northern Colorado Rockies and the history of Late Cenozoic fluvial incision and exhumation across this region.  Major tributaries of the upper Colorado River, including the Gunnison and Dolores Rivers, that drain high topography in central and western Colorado overlie upper mantle with slow seismic wave velocities; these drainages exhibit relatively steep longitudinal profiles (normalized for differences in drainage area and discharge) and are associated with ~1000-1500 m of incision over the past 10 Ma.  In contrast, tributaries of the Green River that drain the western slope in northern Colorado (White, Yampa, and Little Snake Rivers) overlie mantle of progressively lower seismic wave velocities to the north.  River profiles in northern Colorado are two to three times less steep along reaches within comparable bedrock lithologies.  New 40Ar/39Ar ages on basalt flows capping the Tertiary Browns Park Formation in this region range in age from ~11-6 Ma, and provide local datums from which I reconstruct ~500-900 m of incision along tributaries of the Green River.  The correspondence of steep river profiles in regions of greater incision and lower gradient profiles in regions of less incision suggests that the fluvial systems are dynamically adjusting to an external forcing.  Moreover, spatial differences in the pattern and magnitude of incision are not readily explained by a putative increase in erosivity associated with late Cenozoic climate change.  Rather, fluvial incision appears to reflect relative base level fall along the western slope. Given the correspondence of steep channels, deep incision and regions of low seismic velocity mantle, I suggest that differential rock uplift driven, in part, by differences in the buoyancy and/or convective flow of the mantle beneath western Colorado is the likely driver for Neogene incision.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7330], "author_name_tesi": "Rosenberg, Russell Harris", "last_name_ssi": "Rosenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "Harris", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Eric Kirby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Eric Kirby, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rocky Mountains", "Colorado", "incision", "uplift", "dynamic topography", "mantle", "Late Miocene", "Yampa River", "White River"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Sense of Community in Schools: Dimensions and Consequences for Delinquency and Civic Engagement", "id": "10178", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1790", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Robert Putnam, James Coleman, and others have observed and argued that social capital and sense of community (SOC) have been declining sharply for over 4 decades and that we need to find ways to address that loss.

Heavy metals, such as Cd and Zn, occur in soils around the world because of both natural and anthropogenic activities. Soils are highly complex systems in which oxides, layer aluminosilicate clays and organic matter all intimately interact with each other as well as with biological inhabitants of the ecosystem. Trace metal biogeochemical cycles are highly dependent on the types of solid phases and biological organisms present in the ecosystem. The objective of this doctoral research was to increase our scientific understanding of soil and plant factors controlling Cd and Zn biogeochemical cycling in contaminated ecosystems. We address this objective using both model laboratory systems and greenhouse studies in combination with various wet chemical and advanced analytical chemistry techniques. In Chapter 2 we determined that some amino acids (e.g. histidine) can enhance Cd solubilization from Fe (hydr)oxides as much as organic acids, while others (e.g.  cysteine) may limit Cd release. Cadmium incorporation into Fe (hydr)oxide soil minerals may also limit Fe concentrations in contaminated ecosystems. Metal bioavailability was then further explored in Chapter 3 (Cd) and Chapter 4 (Zn) using the Ganges and Prayon ecotypes of the metal hyperaccumulating plant, Noccaea caerulescens. In Chapter 3, results indicated that Cd uptake is determined both by metal content (Zn:Cd ratio and/or total Cd) and plant ecotype. Conversely, Chapter 4 results suggest the main factor causing increased Zn uptake was total soil Zn. Strong organic associations appeared to limit both Cd and Zn uptake from organic matter, resulting in greater Zn uptake from the mineral fractions. Finally, as organic matter (dissolved and solid) greatly influences metal solubility and bioavailability, we developed a novel method to identify molecular composition of in situ produced root exudates. Future efforts should focus on advancing our understanding of interactions between trace elements and organic matter, and the role organic matter and other soil speciation plays in metal bioavailability. Additionally, further studies should investigate non-hyperaccumulating plants in low-to-moderately contaminated ecosystems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8803], "author_name_tesi": "Rosenfeld, Carla Ellen", "last_name_ssi": "Rosenfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "Ellen", "first_name_ssi": "Carla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Martinez", "Richard Charles Stehouwer", "Roger Tai Koide", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Martinez, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Charles Stehouwer, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biogeochemistry", "rhizosphere", "cadmium", "zinc", "contamination"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Tropicality & the 'Other': Origin & Evolution of US-Constructed Cuban Place-Identities", "id": "13755", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7293", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis explores the US-constructed place-identities of Cuba since 1898 and the broad process of tropical \u2018othering\u2019 that the US engaged/engages in with regard to Cuba.  Through textual and archival analysis, the first part of the thesis establishes the US corporate presence in Cuba during the first quarter of the twentieth century by using case studies of the Cuba Company and Hershey.  American presence in the Cuban sugar industry initiated major US tourism to Cuba, which led the US to construct Cuban place-identities and frame Cuban landscapes first in terms of economic potential and second in terms of leisure.  Through content analysis of National Geographic and Traveler magazine photographs coupled with textual analysis of travel texts over the last century, I argue that American uses of Cuban spaces is reflected in and informed its representation of Cuban places; such representations are often informed by US geographical imaginaries.  Additionally, I argue that the discourse of tropicality in which the tropics are dually equated as pestilent and paradisiacal is evident among US representations of Cuban landscapes, visually expressed uniquely through time.  Based on participant observation in Havana, Cuba with a focus on the tourist souvenir landscape, I conclude that the modern tourism industry in Cuba is adopting tropically-inspired US-constructed Cuban place-identities.  I argue that this is a form of post-colonial/imperial hybridity and mimicry, an expression of agency, and ultimately, one component of la lucha, or the daily struggle to survive that many Cubans face.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7270], "author_name_tesi": "Rosenfeld, Christine ", "last_name_ssi": "Rosenfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deryck William Holdsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deryck William Holdsworth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tropicality", "Cuba", "\u2018other", "\u2019 place-identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Coupled 3D Neutronics and Thermal Hydraulics Modeling of the SAFARI-1 Materials Testing Reactor", "id": "13747", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7053", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to create a highly accurate model of the SAFARI-1 materials testing reactor, a facility mainly used for research and for the production of medical isotopes.

Dot Blot analysis of EDA-fibronectin levels to type I and type III collagen levels were compared in implants treated with 10 nM dsODN, type I (p=0.02)and type III (p=0.01).  Collagen levels were significantly decreased compared to controls.  Treatments with 3 nM and 1 nM dsODN did not produce significant changes in the levels of type I, type III collagen or fibronectin.

When treated implants were stained with Sirius red and viewed under  \npolarized light, little collagen appeared between fibroblasts in treated implants. These collagen fiber bundles demonstrated a fine green birefringence, consistent with immature collagen fibers.

The study was conducted using the -170+200 mesh fraction coal in a drop-tube reactor (DTR) at 1,873 K to generate chars at three residence times under air, 21% O2/79% CO2 (oxy-fuel combustion) and 30%O2/70%CO2 (enhanced oxy-fuel combustion) atmospheres. It was observed that oxy-fuel combustion produced a higher carbon conversion compared to that in air for the low-rank subbituminous coal and lignite and also for the high volatile bituminous coal at longer residence times. This effect was even more pronounced at shorter residence times than at longer residence times for all ranks of coal. For the high-rank low volatile coal, air combustion produced a higher carbon conversion than oxy-fuel combustion. Also, as the fraction of O2 was increased in the mixture of O2/CO2, the carbon conversion was found to increase. The higher carbon conversion in low-rank coals under oxy-fuel conditions was attributed to the char-CO2 gasification reactions occurring at high temperatures. The activation energy of the char-CO2 reaction for low-rank coals was more sensitive to temperature than high-rank coals, and the effect was more pronounced in enhancing the carbon conversion. Investigation of the catalytic activity (specifically in catalyzing the char-CO2 reaction) of ion-exchangeable cations in lower rank coal showed that there was a marked decrease in the isothermal reactivity at lower temperatures in a TGA. However, the same effect was not noticed in the drop tube reactor at higher temperatures. The lack of catalytic activity at higher temperatures (> 1,000 K) was attributed sintering of CaO at high temperatures The BET surface area of the chars was found to decrease and the average pore diameter was found to increase with decrease in coal rank showing the higher concentration of macropores in low-rank coals, leading to higher reactivity. Modified burning and reactivity profiles were generated using a thermogravimetric analyzer. The theoretically extrapolated reaction rates corroborated well with the combustion test results with the lower rank coals showing higher char-O2 and char-CO2 reactivity. The effectiveness factors for the char-O2 and char-CO2 reactions indicated a higher degree of diffusion control for the char-O2 reaction. At similar temperature, CO2 molecules are able to access a higher percentage of the internal surface area compared O2 molecules due to relatively lower reactivity of char-CO2 reaction. The results also indicated that carbon conversion was a function of both overall reactivity and effectiveness factor. The influence of the char-CO2 reaction on particle temperature was theoretically modeled and the particles were at much higher temperatures compared to the gas at lower temperatures due to absence of the char-CO2 reaction. However, the particles approached the gas temperature at higher temperatures due to the endothermic char-CO2 reaction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5126], "author_name_tesi": "Roshan Dhaneswar, Sakthivale ", "last_name_ssi": "Roshan Dhaneswar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sakthivale", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["particle temperature", "char reactivity", "char-CO2 reaction", "coal rank", "boiler", "oxy-fuel (O2/CO2) combustion", "gasification", "catalytic activity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Evaluation Of Subconjunctival Administration Of Opioid Growth Factor In Prolonging The Surgical Success Of Full-thickness Filtering Surgery In New Zealand White Rabbits For Treatment Of Glaucoma", "id": "22482", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9939", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Glaucoma is estimated to affect approximately 70 million people worldwide, with over 2.2 million people affected in the U.S.  According to the World Health Organization, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in people.  It is referred to as the \u201csilent thief of sight\u201d because it is predominantly asymptomatic until it has progressed quite severely.   Increased intraocular pressure, is the main risk factor for an indolent optic neuropathy which leads to loss of retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve axons.  There are multiple noninvasive, topical medical treatments for glaucoma.  While these therapies are designed to lower the intraocular pressure, patients often are noncompliant in self-medication due to complicated treatment regimens or to the cost of medication.  Even with compliance, these medications can eventually become ineffective.  Once they become ineffective, invasive measures such as incisional surgical intervention (non-laser) are required.  \n\nOne of the most commonly used surgical procedures is trabeculectomy.  This procedure creates a drainage pathway from the anterior chamber to under the conjunctiva and provides a more efficient pathway for aqueous humor to flow from the eye, thereby lowering the intraocular pressure.   Development of fibrosis resulting from proliferation of Tenon\u2019s capsule fibroblasts creates a mechanical barrier to aqueous outflow through the surgical drainage pathway, and is the most common cause for eventual failure of this procedure.  To try to prolong the success of trabeculectomy, different agents including the use of antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin C have been studied to delay the formation of fibrous tissue.    The problem with these agents is the high potential for severe side effects such as discomfort, endophthalmitis, hypotony, and leakage from the surgical site.  Methionine [Met5] enkephalin, termed opioid growth factor (OGF), is an endogenous opioid peptide that is documented to interact with the OGF receptor to inhibit cell proliferation, including fibroblasts.  Previous work has demonstrated the presence of the OGF-OGFr axis in the eye, including that of rabbit eyes, a commonly used ophthalmic animal model.  Previous studies have shown that there is great potential for utilizing OGF as an adjunct therapy for prevention of rabbit Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (RTCFs) overgrowth as it was nontoxic to RTCFs in cell culture compared to MMC.   The present study compares intraoperative OGF administration with the current practice of using MMC at the time of surgery.  We have utilized New Zealand White rabbits to demonstrate the efficacy of OGF as a possible surgical adjunct for treating glaucoma patients without the tissue toxicity effects frequently encountered with current treatments.  \n\nIn the present study, we have chosen to perform a \u201cfull thickness\u201d filtration procedure rather than a standard trabeculectomy in an effort to maximize the post-operative period of observation prior to procedure failure in each of the various treatment groups.

In the Introduction, I give an overview of how siblings can prove a useful tool for understanding causes and consequences of variation in growth rates, how behavior can play an important role in growth rate variation, and introduce the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) as a study system for behavioral ecology research. The first data chapter (Chapter 2) builds on research to understand factors affecting hind limb length in eastern fence lizards. Lizards that coexist with invasive, red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) have relatively longer hindlimbs than those lizards that live without these ants that serve as both predator and toxic prey. This greater length of hindlimbs could be an evolved trait in response to fire ant invasion, as longer limbs aid in fire ant defense, or it could be a plastic response to higher movement rates as lizards flee ants and forage more for non-toxic prey.  In this first data chapter, I tested whether fence lizards exhibit limb length plasticity by experimentally forcing lizards to climb more or less \u2013 an activity which affects limb length in other taxa. The results of this study reveal that climbing did not increase relative hind limb length of fence lizards. This suggests that observed differences in limb length between populations of lizards that are exposed, or na\u00efve to, invasive fire ants are likely caused by evolved changes in response to altered selective pressures imposed by fire ants, rather than due to plastic, within-lifetime changes.\nIn Chapter 3, I used my study on how climbing behavior could impact growth rates of lizards to inform considerations of ethical laboratory conditions for reptiles. Although many studies now use reptiles for research, little is known about captive housing requirements for these species. Many institutions require researchers to provide environmental enrichment for test animals, but the efficacy of these enrichment practices has only been validated in mammals and birds. I aimed to determine if the provision of climbing enrichment, providing the opportunity for these partially arboreal lizards to exhibit natural behavior, improved the quality of life for these captive animals by measuring: 1) body growth and condition, 2) baseline levels of hormonal stress (as plasma corticosterone, CORT), 3) behavior (time spent active, basking, or hiding), and 4) survival. My results showed that lizards that were provided the opportunity to climb were no larger, were similarly stressed, showed no difference in time spent active, basking, or hiding, and lived just as long as lizards that had no climbing opportunities. These results suggest that, although climbing may be a common escape and basking behavior for these lizards in the wild, the provision of climbing opportunity is unlikely to be an effective form of environmental enrichment for this species. These findings emphasize the need to quantify the impacts of environmental enrichment on common reptilian research species before determining their potential benefit, rather than relying on human intuition as a guide.\nBehaviors, such as activity rates and boldness, have been tied to body size for this and other species. This implies that behavior affects growth rates, driving differences in final body size. Researchers typically assume that this link is driven by these behaviors allowing animals greater access to food resources, such as through increased competitive ability; alternatively, behavior could be the consequence, rather than cause, of body size variation. I tested the relationship between behavior and body size, and the role of competition in mediating this relationship, in the third data chapter (Chapter 4). I measured the activity rates, boldness during open field trials, feeding boldness (i.e., willingness to eat in a new environment), and baseline stress (CORT, an indicator of social status) of sibling lizards. I housed sibling lizards either alone or in social groups and determined if these behaviors or body size had a greater effect on outcomes of high- and low- intensity feeding competition. This study showed that larger lizards are more active, but no bolder than, smaller, same-aged conspecifics, and had similar levels of baseline stress. I found that individuals that scored high for activity, boldness, feeding boldness, and had lower CORT values, were no more likely to eat crickets under high or low competition. Larger lizards did eat more crickets under low feeding competition, but were no more likely to eat under high competition. These results imply that the behaviors measured here do not increase access to resources by making lizards better competitors for food. Indeed, body size had the greatest impact on competitive success. My findings suggest that these behaviors, although frequently correlated with body size, are likely not driving body size variation through impacts on competitive ability but may instead be the result of differences in body size.\nI took this question a step further and determined if activity rates, which positively correlate with body size, could be driving growth rate and body size variation among siblings by quantifying behavior and body size of individual lizards over time (Chapter 5). Eastern fence lizards hatch at approximately the same size, but my previous research reveals that they show considerable variation in body size as sub-adults, reflecting differences in growth rates. If these lizards differ in activity rates at hatching, individuals with higher activity levels may grow to be the larger lizards through greater food intake. Such a relationship between early activity rates and later body size would help explain why activity rates are correlated with body size later in development, and allow us to predict future growth patterns and adult body sizes from behavior expressed very early in life. To test this hypothesis, I measured activity rates of lizards when they were 8 days old, and again after siblings had significantly diverged in body size, at 8 weeks old. The results of this study demonstrated that, although the most active hatchlings at 8 days old are also the most active at 8 weeks of age, and that these more active lizards are also larger at 8 weeks of age, an individual\u2019s activity rates at 8 days of age did not predict body size at 8 weeks of age. This provides additional evidence to support the conclusions of Chapter 4, that higher activity rates may be a consequence of intrinsic growth rates, as individuals that are growing faster are forced to be more active to obtain the resources necessary to support growth, rather than a cause of growth rate variation.\nFast growth rates, and associated larger body size, can provide important fitness benefits. However, energy limitations can mean that growth is prioritized over other traits such as reproductive investment. As a result, individuals that grow faster may do so at the expense of sexual maturity. For example, larger body size often increases reproductive output, but for animals that reproduce seasonally, there may not be enough time to acquire the energy necessary for large body size and reproductive maturity. However, such tradeoffs may not be present in individuals or populations that are not energetically constrained, or in cases where the selective advantages of large size and reproductive maturity are both strong. Eastern fence lizards breed only during the summer and have few opportunities to reproduce in a lifetime. Furthermore, offspring produced earlier in the breeding season have more time for growth and have higher rates of survival. As a result, selection may favor individuals that grow to larger size and mature later with higher reproductive output later (at cost to current reproduction), or individuals that mature earlier and reproduce at the beginning of the following season, thereby breeding earlier but producing fewer offspring. I tested for a tradeoff between growth rate and sexual maturity in male and female fence lizards that were approximately the same age and reared in the laboratory. I used testes mass and secondary sexual characteristics (signaling badge size and color) to quantify male reproductive status. For females, I counted the number of egg follicles, weighed them, and determined the number of these that were vitellogenic (yolked). My results show no evidence of a tradeoff between growth and reproductive maturity in this species. Larger males had larger testes but did not differ in badge size or color. Larger females had heavier follicles, but did not have more follicles overall, and were more likely to have vitellogenic follicles. For females that did have these yolked follicles, there was no relationship between body size and number of vitellogenic follicles. This study shows that there may not be a tradeoff between growth and sexual maturity in this species; instead, some individuals are able to allocate more energy into both body growth and reproductive maturity than others. \nThis dissertation provides insight into the role of behavior in affecting limb morphology, competitive success, growth rates, and the potential for reproductive costs of faster growth, while controlling for genetic factors and age. Together, this body of work reveals that growth rates (of limbs and body size) 1) are likely under strong selective pressure, 2) exhibit relatively little plasticity, and 3) that behavior is primarily a consequence, rather than a cause, of intrinsic variation in growth rate and resulting body size. Inter-individual variation in body size is not the result of differential tradeoffs with reproductive maturity; instead, some individuals are able to allocate more energy to both of these functions than can others, likely with important fitness benefits. The research presented here provides an important foundation for future scientific inquiries regarding the impacts of behavior on morphology, reproduction, and survival in wild populations. \n \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7624], "author_name_tesi": "Rosier, Renee Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Rosier", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Renee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "James Harold Marden", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde, Dissertation Advisor", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Committee Chair", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["corticosterone", "activity rates", "boldness", "feeding competition", "reproductive tradeoff", "body size", "reproductive tradeoff", "maturity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Influences on salinity variability and change in the Delaware Estuary", "id": "18891", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9061", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In estuaries, salinity has a strong influence on both the physical properties of the estuary and the health of the estuarine ecosystem.

Replacing time with sea level in the models produces salinity-sea level relationships that match those predicted by dynamical models, which suggests that sea-level rise is causing increased salinity in the estuary. Alongshore wind stress also appears to play some role in driving salinity variations, consistent with the associated Ekman transport between the estuary and the ocean.

Estuaries like these bays are uniquely characterized by salinity variation from riverine freshwater to oceanic saltwater, both horizontally and vertically, and by the strength of their tides. From a meteorological perspective, estuaries are interesting because they are influenced by many aspects of\nweather and climate variability, including runoff and winds. Future climate changes, including changes\nin river discharge and mean sea level, are also likely to produce significant changes in estuarine salinity and circulation and could alter estuarine ecosystems. To predict the effects these changes may have\non estuarine salinity, circulation, and ecosystems, numerical model simulations are often applied.\nHowever, the predictive capability of numerical models is unknown due in part to a lack of knowledge about historical trends and whether numerical models can reproduce them. This dissertation is composed of three studies that address this lack of knowledge. The first study of this dissertation analyzes data from tide gauges in Chesapeake and Delaware Bays and compares the results with model simulations to determine what trends are present and whether the numerical model correctly predicts these trends. When using the numerical model for predictions, it is also important to account for uncertainty in the model and its inputs, but doing so is difficult due to the chain of computationally expensive models typically used to simulate estuaries. The second study of this dissertation examines a method to account for uncertainty in future river discharge, and the third study conducts an analysis of which inputs the numerical model is most sensitive to.\n\nIn the first study, statistical models show negative M2 amplitude trends at the mouths of both bays, while some upstream locations have insignificant or positive trends. To determine whether sea-level rise is\nresponsible for these trends, a term for mean sea level is included in the statistical models and the results are compared with with predictions from numerical and analytical models. The observed and predicted sensitivities of M2 amplitude and phase to mean sea level are similar, although the numerical model amplitude is less sensitive to sea level. The sensitivity occurs as a result of strengthening and shifting of the amphidromic system in the Chesapeake Bay and decreasing frictional effects and increasing convergence in the Delaware Bay. After accounting for the effect of sea level, significant negative background M2 and S2 amplitude trends are present; these trends may be related to other factors such as dredging, tide gauge errors, or river discharge. Projected changes in tidal amplitudes due to sea-level rise over the twenty-first century are substantial in some areas, but depend significantly on modeling assumptions.\n\nThe second study examines the impacts of methods for model selection on projections of runoff change for the Susquehanna River Basin. The results from an ensemble of 29 global climate models and 29 corresponding hydrological model simulations were compared with the results that would have been obtained by applying five different selection strategies to the climate model data and using only the selected models to drive the hydrological model. Only one method, the KKZ algorithm, produced results that met the objective of the method and were not strongly sensitive to the number of models selected. Regardless of the selection method used, the results for small model subsets (fewer than about 7 models) were highly variable and failed to cover the uncertainty present in the full model dataset. On the other hand, results from the complete model ensemble may be affected by structurally and statistically similar models. This study shows that the methods and models used in similar top-down studies should be carefully chosen and that the results obtained should be interpreted with caution.\n\nFinally, estuarine physics and water quality are strongly controlled by climate and oceanographic variability.\nClimate and oceanographic conditions are likely to change in the future as a result of global climate change, and it is important to consider how these changes, and how uncertainty surrounding these changes,\ncould affect water quality and management. To do so, numerical models are typically used to simulate estuarine physics and water quality under scenarios of future conditions. However, the numerical models typically used for simulating estuaries are computationally demanding, limiting the ability to understand and quantify uncertainty in the model results. In the third study of this dissertation, a computationally inexpensive statistical model, or metamodel, is tested as a surrogate for numerical model simulations. The metamodel is fit to 12 numerical model simulations of the Chesapeake Bay and used to simulate stratification, circulation, and mean salinity under sampled probability distributions of projected future mean sea level, river discharge, and tidal amplitudes along the shelf. The simulations from the metamodel show that future salinity, stratification, and circulation are all likely to be higher than present-day averages. However, the metamodel indicates that model projections of salinity and stratification are highly sensitive to uncertainty about future tidal amplitudes along the shelf. Since previous studies have focused on potential changes in either river discharge or sea level while neglecting any change in tidal amplitude, these results demonstrate the importance of conducting a thorough sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Future studies should build from this concept by including more sources of uncertainty, such as wind speed and direction and model parameters and structures.\n\nThe results in this dissertation show that although numerical models are capable of reproducing some past changes, the impacts of future climate and oceanographic changes on these estuaries remain highly uncertain.  Salinity and stratification in the Chesapeake Bay are fairly likely to increase as a result of a highly probable increase in mean sea level, although exact changes are especially sensitive to changes in tidal amplitude. Model simulations of future tides in both bays appear to be sensitive to the methods used to model sea-level rise even though the simulations of past tides in this dissertation are not. In future work, it will be important to consider this uncertainty, to consider other uncertainties that were neglected in this dissertation, and to examine the impacts on biogeochemistry and overall ecosystem health.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15971], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Andrew Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Najjar", "Raymond Najjar", "Michael Mann", "David Titley", "Klaus Keller", "Ming Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Najjar, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Najjar, Committee Chair", "Michael Mann, Committee Member", "David Titley, Committee Member", "Klaus Keller, Outside Member", "Ming Li, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chesapeake Bay", "Delaware Bay", "Tides", "Climate change", "Uncertainty"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A THERMODYNAMICS BASED GUIDE TO ADDING HF TO A NI-SUPERALLOY TO IMPROVE OXIDATION RESISTANCE", "id": "14808ajr335", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis focuses on the addition of the reactive element Hf to aid in the oxidation resistance of Ni-superalloys. Hf will improve the oxidation resistance of a given Al2O3 forming alloy when added to the alloy in small concentrations. However, when too much Hf is added, or rather when Hf is \u201cover-doped\u201d, the oxidation resistance begins to worsen again. To date there is no design criteria for how much Hf should be added. The traditional value is around 0.1 at.%. This thesis looks to establish thermodynamic criteria for the addition of Hf based on consideration for the reactions at the alloy/Al2O3 interface. \n\nThe first part of this thesis is on the important Hf-Ni binary system. This system has been investigated several times in the literature but often using Hf sources contaminated by Zr. This work seeks to remodel the Hf-Ni system through the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) approach based on first-principles calculations based in density functional theory (DFT) and additional experiments using high purity Hf. Diffusion couples in the Ni-rich portion of the Hf-Ni system were heat treated and analyzed at 1173.15, 1273.15 and 1373.15 K, respectively, to measure phase stability and Hf solubility in the fcc phase. The solubility observed in fcc Ni from Ni/Ni50Hf50 (at.%) diffusion couples is larger than that reported in previous experiments. These results are the only source fit to during modeling of the fcc solubility to avoid effects from Zr contamination. Data in the literature suggests that the high temperature crystal structure of the B33 NiHf phase is, in fact, the B2 structure. Because this phase has been observed to be in solid solution with the high temperature B2-NiTi, it has been modeled here as B2. Modeling of this phase was aided by first-principles calculations using special quasi-random structures (SQS). \n.\n\nFollowing this, the Ni-rich Al-Hf-Ni system and the Ni-rich Cr-Hf-Ni system are modeled to develop a Ni-rich model for the Al-Cr-Hf-Ni system. These models are based on experiments and first-principles calculations using density functional theory, both carried out in the present work. Thermodynamic models are developed with a focus on the fcc-\u03b3, L12-\u03b3', A2, B2, L21 and P62m-NiAlCr phases. Additional focus is placed on the \u03b7-Ni7Hf2 phase and the \u03bb-Ni3Hf phase, both with solubility of Al, Cr and Ni based on available work in the literature. Isothermal heat treatments are performed on alloys in the Ni-rich Al-Hf-Ni system and the Ni-rich Cr-Hf-Ni system in the range of 1273.15 K to 1473.15 K using high purity Hf to avoid Zr contamination. Density functional theory calculations are performed to obtain formation enthalpies for stoichiometric phases and the mixing enthalpies in the fcc-\u03b3, L12-\u03b3', A2, and B2 phases using SQS. Finite temperature properties of some end-members in the \u03b3', L21 and P62m-NiAlCr phases are obtained by first-principles calculations. The current models replicate the present experiments in the Ni-rich Al-Hf-Ni and Cr-Hf-Ni systems well and agree with many features from other experimental investigations in the literature. These thermodynamic descriptions are then combined with thermodynamic models of the Al-Cr-Ni system and other binary models from the literature to form the thermodynamic description of the quaternary system. Good agreement is found between quaternary experiments and the calculations from the present thermodynamic description.\n\nOver-doping is accompanied by precipitation of HfO2 in and beneath the external Al2O3 layer, i.e. the co-existence of these two oxides at the alloy/Al2O3 interface. This equilibrium can thus be used to determine the maximum Hf concentration which will result in HfO2 precipitation. This Hf concentration is termed the \u201cHf-tolerance\u201d and calculated with the alloy/Al2O3/HfO2 equilibrium. The Al-Cr-Hf-Ni thermodynamic description is combined with the thermodynamic descriptions of Al2O3 and HfO2 to study this equilibrium in terms of the Hf and Al activities in the alloy. The calculated Hf-tolerance is compared with available observations in the literature and is in good agreement. It is shown that the \u03b3' phase plays a key role in increasing the Hf-tolerance.\n\nFinally, the effects of other alloying elements on the Hf-tolerance is explored. In the present work interactions between Hf and other alloying elements in the fcc/L12 phase are obtained from DFT-based first-principles calculations. Since the ordered L12-Ni3Al (\u03b3') phase is already understood to be important for oxidation resistance, only elements with a solubility in the L12 phase of greater than 5 at.% at 1000 \u00b0C are chosen for study. The calculations confirm that Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, and Si are the most beneficial alloying elements as reported in the literature experimentally. Given this information, the Al-Cr-Hf-Ni-Pt-O system is modeled, and used to calculate the Hf-tolerance in the Ni-rich Al-Hf-Ni-Pt and Al-Cr-Hf-Ni-Pt systems. Results from these calculations agree well with experimental observations.\n\nIn summary, this thesis provides a thermodynamic criterion on the maximum Hf contents on improving oxidation resistance of Al2O3 forming Ni-superalloys. This criterion is established by developing thermodynamic descriptions of several multicomponent systems including xxx using data from DFT-based first-principles calculations and experiments in the current work and the literature and by calculating the equilibrium between alloys/Al2O3/HfO2.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16093], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Austin Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Austin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu", "Long-Qing Chen", "Hojong Kim", "Ismaila Dabo", "Vincent Crespi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi-Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Hojong Kim, Committee Member", "Ismaila Dabo, Committee Member", "Vincent Crespi, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oxidation", "Superalloys", "Bond-coat", "HfO2", "Hafnium", "external scale", "TGO"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Solubility of Oxygen and Hydrogen and Diffusivity of Oxygen in the fcc Phase of the Al-fe-ni-h-o System with Application to the Formation of a Protective \u03b1-al2o3 Scale at High Temperatures ", "id": "26535", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis will focus on the formation of a protective \u03b1-Al2O3 layer on Ni-base superalloys during high temperature oxidation in dry and wet gaseous environments. Ni alloys have proven useful in energy and aerospace applications due to their high melting points and excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. High operating temperatures in air will result in aggressive forms of gaseous attack \u2013 especially by oxygen. For temperatures in excess of 1000 \u00baC an external, slow growing layer of \u03b1-Al2O3 on the surface of the alloy system is necessary to prevent excessive oxidation. Designing an alloy which has the necessary amount of Al required to form an external scale of \u03b1-Al2O3 requires detailed knowledge of the O solubility, O diffusivity, and Al diffusivity for the system of interest. \nThe present thesis develops a thermodynamic description of the Al-Fe-Ni-O-H system and a kinetic description of O and Al in the fcc phase of the Al-Fe-Ni-O system. Special attention is given to the solubility of H and O in the fcc phase in the developed thermodynamic models. Using the calculation of phase diagram (CALPHAD) method, these models are constructed from available experimental data and theoretical data calculated using density functional theory (DFT.) Information on O diffusion in the system will also be collected from experiments and calculated from first-principles so as to construct a description of the O and Al mobility.\nWhen \u03b1-Al2O3 forming alloys are oxidized in wet environments the amount of Al needed to form an external, protective layer increases. Both an increase in O solubility and a decrease in the driving force of \u03b1-Al2O3 due to the presence of dissolved H from H2O have been suggested to explain this effect. The thermodynamic models developed herein are used to test these hypotheses. The calculated effect of dissolved H is to decrease the solubility of O and does not significantly decrease the driving force for \u03b1-Al2O3. \nTwo models which predict Al concentrations likely to form scales of \u03b1-Al2O3, using solubility and diffusivity information developed in this thesis as inputs, are tested in both the Ni-xAl and Ni-xFe-yAl fcc-solid solution strengthened systems. The predictions for external scale formation in each system are in good agreement with experimental findings for each model. These predictions are discussed with respect to the calculated O solubility in the Ni-O system.

First, it demonstrates how the participants, 14 Mexican women living in Southeastern Pennsylvania,  use contextualization cues (Gumperz, 1982, 1989, 1992a, 1992b, 1997; Schiffrin, 1996) and subjectivity (Banfield, 1982; Benveniste, 1971) in narratives about their own lives to express different aspects of their identities. Secondly, it  discusses these identities in relation to how they affect the participants\u2019 investment (Norton, 1997, 2000; Norton-Pierce, 1995) in the English language.\nThis study combines discourse analysis with ethnographically rich data collection methods. It focuses on structural aspects of the discourse of the participants that closely parallel those analyzed by De Fina in her (2004) study of \u201cIdentity in narrative.\u201d  These are: the use of terms of reference to ethnic or nationality groups, the use of reported speech, and expressions of agency. However, in this dissertation, these structures are studied in relation to three different predominant identities that emerged in the participants\u2019 discourse:  ethnic, gendered, and literate identities, respectively.\nAnalysis revealed that the participants\u2019 use of references to ethnic or nationality groups indexes their identification mainly with their own family, and with the people with whom they associate socially, rather than to their ethnic group as a whole. A certain degree of identification with people who are able to understand them and a simultaneous distancing from monolingual English speakers who are unable or unwilling to communicate with them was also found.\nWithin the analysis of the participants\u2019 gendered identity, it was found that they exhibited a marked preference for citing themselves rather than their spouses. This challenges traditional views of Hispanic women\u2019s gendered roles. The use of reported speech also appears to have the function of highlighting important sections of narrative, and of enhancing the affect in these sections. \nThe analysis of the participants\u2019 literate identity reveals that they present themselves as not having had full control over their past learning experiences, and that they feel they have little or no control over their future education. The participants exhibited a tendency to downplay their agency in events related to the learning or studying of language, literacy, and other skills. They also frequently presented themselves in non-agentive positions within these events.\nIt becomes apparent that of these three predominant identities, the participants\u2019 ethnic and literate identities have a clearly more detrimental effect on their investment in the English language. However, it was also found that obtaining a rewarding job in which they have to use English has highly motivated some of the participants to further their studies of the language.\nIn conclusion, a better understanding of the identities of the participants has yielded a clearer picture of why they have not become invested in the English language, in spite of the overt declaration of their intent.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [736], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Brenda M.", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Brenda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Susan Strauss And Sr Suresh Canagarajah", "Susan G Strauss", "Athelstan Canagarajah", "Karen E Johnson", "Esther Susana Prins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Susan Strauss And Sr Suresh Canagarajah, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan G Strauss, Committee Chair", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ethnic identity", "discourse analysis", "investment", "identity", "language", "gender", "agency"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Labile C constrains soil respiration in ponderosa pine forests during short-term precipitation manipulation and long-term crown fire recovery\n\n\n", "id": "8770", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1140", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ponderosa pine forests in the Southwest United States historically experienced frequent, low intensity surface fires, which maintained relatively open forests by removing dead woody material and most pine regeneration.  Following a century of fire suppression, however, these forests have become major carbon (C) sinks, due to greatly increased tree densities.  Yet high tree densities also increase fuel loading, leading to stand-replacing wildfires, which greatly decrease the carbon stored in this system.  Because stand-replacing fires are new to this ecosystem, it is unclear how forest C storage and fluxes recover from wildfires and how this recovery may vary with predicted changes in precipitation patterns.  We quantified soil C dynamics in ponderosa pine forests near Flagstaff, AZ, and examined the effects of summer precipitation and wildfire history on soil respiration rates and soil C stocks.  We hypothesized that recently burned forests would have lower soil respiration rates than unburned forests, because fire would reduce the amount of soil C available for microbial activity, but that the difference between burned and unburned sites would diminish with increasing time since the fire.  Prior research has shown that summer monsoons stimulate soil respiration.  We hypothesized that burned forests would respond less to monsoons than unburned forests, again due to lower labile C availability.  Finally, we hypothesized that a longer monsoon season, as predicted by some circulation models, would increase soil respiration from burned and unburned forests.  Although time since wildfire did not affect soil respiration, the other two hypotheses were supported.  Soil respiration from unburned forests was ~ 1.1 g CO2-C m-2 d-1 before the start of the monsoon season and ~ 4.8 g CO2-C m-2 d-1 after, with burned forest respiration generally 25% lower.  Burned forests had ~ 40% less total soil C, with the majority of that difference due to the loss of the O horizon after fire.  Mineral soil C pools were not significantly affected by fire.  We artificially simulated an earlier monsoon season and found that soil respiration rates showed a dramatic initial increase in response to watering, but decreased to below control rates within weeks.  Thus, watering did not significantly change the amount of C respired over the course of the experiment, suggesting that precipitation from an earlier monsoon season may not increase total CO2 respiration.  A laboratory incubation of soils collected at the end of the watering treatment showed ~30% less labile C in burned soils than unburned soils.  Our results indicate that total soil C, labile C, and soil respiration remain low in southwestern ponderosa pine forests up to 35 years after crown fire.  We attribute this poor ecosystem recovery to co-limitation of soil C processes by both water and labile C availability.  Because these forests have limited potential for pine regeneration following crown fire, future recovery of soil C is uncertain.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1128], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Christopher Schultz", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "Schultz", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Philip Kaye, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil respiration", "ponderosa pine", "stand-replacing fire", "C storage"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "KINETIC AND BIOCHEMCIAL ANALYSIS OF ELECTRON TRANSFER IN DISSIMILATORY METAL REDUCTION BY SHEWANELLA ONEIDENSIS MR-1", "id": "9997", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1383", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nBiochemical studies were used to further elucidate the pathway of electron transfer across the outer membrane (OM) of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and scaling kinetics were conducted to determine the dependence of two OM proteins, OmcA and MtrC, in dissimilatory metal reduction (DMR).  \nAn outer membrane (OM) protein complex MtrC/A/B was purified from anaerobically grown Shewanella oneidensis MR-1.  Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to characterize the complex and its molecular mass was determined to be approximately 198 kDa, which is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry of the individual subunits.  This protein complex reduced both soluble and insoluble iron and manganese forms, with rates of reduction correlating to the metal species; i.e. soluble iron was reduced fastest while the most crystalline iron mineral goethite was reduced slowest.  This trend is dependent upon the mineral reactivity and not enzyme specificity and therefore these proteins merely act as grounding wires to transfer electrons out of the cell.  \nRates of iron reduction were determined at three scales: transient state with purified enzymes, steady state with total membrane (TM) fractions, and steady state with whole cells (WC).  Transient state soluble iron reduction kinetic analysis was performed using stop flow techniques to determine molecular rate constants.  The reactivity of soluble iron forms for both OmcA and MtrC follows the decrease in the association constant for ligand-metal complexation:  EDTA-Fe3+, NTA-Fe3+, and Citrate-Fe3+.  Western blot analysis was used to determine the molar amounts of OmcA and MtrC in TM and WC samples in order to convert specific activity (moles Fe2+ formed/min/mg protein) to a velocity (s-1 : moles Fe2+ formed/sec/moles OmcA).  Comparison of rates between transient state and steady state revealed that OmcA and MtrC are kinetically competent to account for whole cell catalysis of soluble iron.  When rates of reduction of solid Fe-oxides (goethite) were compared at each kinetic scale, transient-state rate constants were 100 to 1000 times slower than steady-state rate constants.  When flavins were included in the reaction mechanism, kinetic competence was exhibited.  Thus, electron shuttles, such as flavins, are necessary to account for catalysis of goethite in whole cells.\nAs observed for iron oxides, OmcA and MtrC were not kinetically competent to account for physiological manganese oxide reduction via direct contact because the relevant rate constants were 3 orders of magnitude too slow.  In the presence of flavins, the reaction rates were greatly increased and able to account for the reduction of insoluble manganese oxides in vivo.  The extent of flavin stimulation was dependent upon the mineral reactivity, with regards to mineral composition (Fe versus Mn) and mineral structure.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1372], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Daniel Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ming Tien", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Squire J Booker", "B Tracy Nixon", "Kathleen Postle", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ming Tien, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dissimilatory metal reduction", "scaling kinetics", "protein-protein interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR THE CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF A\nDUAL-CORE BOILING SUPERHEAT REACTOR", "id": "9658", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3140", "abstract_tesi": "For research concerning economical applications of high temperature reactor\ntechnology, a novel approach for creating a Boiling Superheat Reactor (BSR) by\naugmenting an Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) vessel with a steam\nsuperheating reactor core is examined.

This research also compares different design options by searching for the global optimum for all cases investigated: (A) varying the fiber/matrix ratio of each material ring in the composite rotor; (B) including radial fibers in addition to the circumferential fibers for each material ring; (C) co-mingling two fiber materials with a variable ratio in each material ring; (D) material ring press-fitting; and (E) matrix ballasting, where high-density particles can infiltrate the matrix to vary the density, stiffness, and thermal coefficient of expansion within each material ring. The results show that fixing both the outer and inner rotor radii in an optimization search produces a highly restrictive design constraint compared to when at least one of the radii are allowed to vary. The combinations that hold the most promise without producing overly restrictive, trivial, or degenerate solutions are as follows: (1) total stored energy, fixed outer radius, (2) specific energy, fixed outer radius, with a minimum total stored energy constraint.

Participants, working in counter-balanced pairs, were asked to collaboratively work through one set of tasks using the simultaneous application mode, then another set of tasks using the parallel mode or the reverse.  In the simultaneous mode, each user could simultaneously interact with a shared query building interface.  In the parallel mode users could communicate with each other and share data on the public tab, but there was no shared query building interface with which they could simultaneously interact, only a private interface.  A total of 16 participants took part in the experiment and they each completed a follow-up survey to answer questions about which mode they preferred, report any critical incidents that occurred or features that they liked, and provide additional comments and suggestions.  The main finding, along with all of the in-depth feedback from the participants, is that 56% of participants preferred the parallel mode of collaborative query building, while 44% preferred the simultaneous mode.  The results of this experiment ultimately show that in geocollaboration software there is a place for both private and shared query building tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3543], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Kevin Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan Maceachren", "Alan Maceachren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan Maceachren, Thesis Advisor", "Alan Maceachren, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["synchronous collaboration", "spatial queries", "GIS", "groupware", "geographic information science", "geocollaboration", "web mapping", "CSCW"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Strong-field Ionization Leading To Coulomb Explosion of Small Clusters", "id": "15753", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7990", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The strong-field interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter is an important area of study for understanding the specific mechanisms of ionization.

Metal-containing clusters show ionization behavior that is highly dependent on the properties of the metal.  Electrons in d and f-orbitals are delocalized, allowing for greater collective electron effects (such as ionization ignition, non-adiabatic electron dynamics, and electron impacts) to occur and thus, larger enhancements in ionization are observed in metal-containing clusters.

Hispanic children have higher rates of overweight and lower rates of physical activity than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. With obesity reaching epidemic levels in the U.S., physical activity has been identified as an important behavior to combat obesity, and maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent disease. However, the role of culture and context in Hispanic children and children of immigrants\u2019 physical activity attitudes, preferences, and behaviors is not well understood. The aim of this research was to examine the way in which different levels of the ecological model, including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community and societal-level factors, were related to the physical activity behaviors and weight status of Hispanic children and children of immigrants.\n\nIn the first study (Chapter 2), we examined the associations among immigrant generation and language with relative weight (BMI z-scores), physical activity, screen time, and participation in extracurricular activities (i.e., sports, clubs) in a nationally representative sample of 6-11 year old Hispanic children. This study found that compared to 3rd generation, English-speaking children, 1st and 2nd generation, non-English speaking children were more likely to be overweight, and less likely to participate in regular physical activity and sports. In the second study (Chapter 3), we investigated whether this relationship was present in a nationally representative sample of youth (10-17 years), and whether participation in physical activity and sports was equally protective across youth immigrant generation and sex. This study confirmed the findings from the previous study that physical activity tends to increase and weight status tends to decrease with subsequent generations living in the U.S. Furthermore, results revealed that engaging in physical activity was protective against overweight for 3rd generation boys and girls, while participation in sports conferred protection against overweight in 1st generation boys and 3rd generation girls, only. In the third study (Chapter 4), we took a mixed methods approach to explore the experience of physical activity in Hispanic children of immigrants (1st and 2nd generation), including examining the children\u2019s specific physical activity attitudes, preferences, and behaviors. This study revealed that children spent the majority of their time in sedentary activity (87%), did not differ in their preferences of sedentary or moderate-vigorous activities, and uncovered specific negative/positive attitudes toward physical activity. Furthermore, barriers and facilitators of children\u2019s physical activity were related to the parent/home environment, school and neighborhood context. \n\nTaken together, these three studies provide evidence that the determinants of physical activity in Hispanic children and children of immigrants are multi-factorial, and various levels of the ecological model, including intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, and societal-level factors affect children\u2019s physical activity, sport participation, and subsequent weight status. Furthermore, cultural factors, such as immigrant generation and language, and other poverty-specific factors, should be taken into account when designing multi-leveled interventions to increase physical activity in low-income immigrant families.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5582], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Sharon E.", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Sharon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lori Anne Francis", "Lori Anne Francis", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Robert William Schrauf", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lori Anne Francis, Dissertation Advisor", "Lori Anne Francis, Committee Chair", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Member", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Member", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["physical activity", "immigrant", "public health", "obesity", "health promotion", "children"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Spaces of Play: Inventing the Modern Leisure Space in British Fiction and Culture, 1860-1960\n", "id": "12245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation seeks to establish the very real and important relationship between British modernist literature and the emergence of the modern leisure space after 1867. At the core of this dissertation is that claim that as leisure spaces spatially, socially, and economically modernized\u2014as the inn became the hotel, the coast became the seaside resort, the natural spring became the spa, and the sailing ship became the luxury liner\u2014they territorialized (both literally and figuratively) the concept of leisure in a way that is both historically unique and significant for the study of literary modernism. In studying this relationship, this dissertation draws from leisure studies, an umbrella term for the study of leisure with roots in late nineteenth-century industrial geography. Literary criticism has largely abstained from these interdisciplinary conversations about leisure, and one of the goals of this dissertation is to disrupt this unproductive silence. Conversely, while a few leisure scholars of the past two decades have identified leisure and its cultural institutions as specifically modern constructions, scholars of literature, and scholars of modernism in particular, have much to contribute to leisure studies in the way of teasing out this fundamental yet neglected relationship between leisure and modernity.\n\nIn addition to foregrounding the mutual interdependence between scholarly discourses of modernist literature and of leisure studies, this project offers an account of nineteenth- and twentieth-century non-fiction written about the emergence of leisure as a central field of discursive, economic, and social investment in Great Britain. I juxtapose this non-fiction with fiction by James and Forster to emphasize modernist literature\u2019s tendency to play self-reflexively with philosophical and political conversations about leisure. To investigate modernist literary representations of leisure, I focus on two of the chief leisure spaces in modern fiction: the hotel and the ocean liner. One chapter discusses the emergence of the modern hotel in the nineteenth century by way of works by Dickens, Chesterton, and Trollope, while the following chapter presents a survey of modernist hotel fiction, including works by Mansfield, Bennett, and Orwell, and Bowen. Finally, two chapters on the cruise ship include a cultural studies style analysis of the ocean liner\u2019s use as a representative figure for modernity, and readings of works by Waugh and Sackville-West situate modernist leisure fiction firmly within contemporary arguments about modernism\u2019s relationship to transnational flows, empire, and mass media technologies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5702], "author_name_tesi": "Ross, Shawna Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Ross", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Shawna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon", "Janet Wynne Lyon", "Mark Stewart Morrisson", "Jeffrey Nealon", "Jonathan Paul Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janet Wynne Lyon, Dissertation Advisor", "Janet Wynne Lyon, Committee Chair", "Mark Stewart Morrisson, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Henry James", "transnational modernism", "hospitality", "hotel", "ocean liner", "cruise ship", "sociology of leisure", "leisure studies", "modernist literature", "modernism", "E M Forster", "Katherine Mansfield", "Queen Mary", "Cunard"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Essays in Financial Economics\n", "id": "11020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4434", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contains two essays.\n\nIn the first essay, I revisit the relative role of credit risk and illiquidity as determinants of corporate bond prices. Using TRACE transaction data from January 2003 to December 2008, I find that high-frequency firm equity volatility measures explain 40% of the variation of corporate yield spreads and as much as 52% of the variation in a multivariate context. In contrast, trading-based illiquidity measures such as the percentage of zero trading days, the friction measure used by Chen, Lesmond, and Wei (2007), and a new measure derived in this paper explain approximately an incremental 1% of the cross-sectional variation of yield spreads.\nUnlike other friction models, the proposed model includes firm-specific factors in the return generating process and relaxes the assumption of constant liquidity. As a result, liquidity cost estimates are lower and uncorrelated with corporate yield spreads. Overall, my findings suggest that credit risk is the main determinant of corporate yield spreads and that certain trading-based illiquidity measures actually capture credit risk.\n\nIn the second essay,  I study the intimate relation between market participation and asset allocation decisions.\nUsing data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX), and a two-step procedure initially proposed by Heckman (1979}, I jointly model and estimate market participation and dividend preferences, and show that failure to account for them jointly could potentially bias standard models of dividend clienteles. The estimated coefficients prove that market frictions and behavioral biases combine to affect US households' market participation and dividend preferences.\nOverall, my findings bring new complexity to the identification of age- and income-based\ndividend clienteles documented in the literature, and offer a non-behavioral explanation to\nrecent evidence that current consumption is more sensitive to dividends than to capital gains.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4404], "author_name_tesi": "Rossi, Marco ", "last_name_ssi": "Rossi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Marco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jing Zhi Huang", "Jing Zhi Huang", "Jean Helwege", "Joel Matthew Vanden", "William Kracaw", "John C Liechty"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jing Zhi Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jing Zhi Huang, Committee Chair", "Jean Helwege, Committee Member", "Joel Matthew Vanden, Committee Member", "William Kracaw, Committee Member", "John C Liechty, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["household finance", "Credit risk"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BOROHYDRIDE OXIDATION OVER THE AU(111) AND PT(111) SURFACES: A FIRST PRINCIPLES STUDY OF THE REACTION MECHANISM", "id": "10453", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2162", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Direct borohydride fuel cells (DBFCs) offer the potential for direct chemical to electrical energy conversion from a high specific energy, water soluble fuel.

In this study, we apply electronic structure calculations to elucidate the mechanism of borohydride oxidation over the Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. Reaction free energies computed as a function of electrode potential are used to identify stable surface bound intermediates and likely rate limiting steps. The results suggest that the weak adsorption of BH4- over Au(111) may limit the coverage of reactive intermediates at low overpotentials.

The mechanism of borohydride oxidation and the competing hydrolysis reaction is also examined over Pt(111) using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Adsorption over Pt(111) is dissociative  and extremely exothermic at potentials of interest, leading to a high surface coverage of H* for which gaseous hydrogen evolution is competitive with oxidation. Elementary surface reactions oxidizing B-containing intermediates are favorable over Pt(111) at -0.85 V(NHE), consistent with experimental voltammetry results in the literature.

Poor anode efficiency limits DBFC application. For my Masters of Science thesis published in December 2009, I studied the borohydride oxidation mechanism over the Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. I applied density functional theory (DFT) methods to compute reaction free energies as a function of electrode potential. Stable surface intermediates and likely limiting steps were identified. In this doctoral dissertation, borohydride oxidation electrokinetics over the Au(111) surface are predicted using first-principles determined elementary rate constants and a microkinetic model. A method to approximate the potential dependent elementary step activation barriers based on density functional theory calculations is developed and applied to the minimum energy path for borohydride oxidation. Activation barriers of the equivalent non-electrochemical reactions are calculated and made potential dependent using a method similar to Butler-Volmer kinetics. The kinetic controlled region of the borohydride oxidation reaction linear sweep voltammogram over the Au(111) surface is simulated. The simulation results suggest that BH2OH and BH3 are stable surface intermediates at potentials where an oxidation current is observed. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy shows that BH3 is a stable intermediate. \nA new catalyst is proposed for the borohydride electrooxidation reaction. Gold-copper binary metals are predicted to increase the activity compared to a pure gold electrode, while maintaining the selectivity comparable to gold. The Au-Cu catalyst is prepared using electrodeposition and examined by linear sweep voltammetry experiments. A Au88.5Cu11.5 electrode decreased the anodic overpotential by 0.17 V, however the surface is not stable at potentials above -0.2 V (NHE). Binding energies and adsorption free energies of the BH4- ion over other surface alloys are also examined and reported. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12788], "author_name_tesi": "Rostamikia, Gholamreza ", "last_name_ssi": "Rostamikia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gholamreza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael J.

This has led to the need for pediatric circulatory support devices to aid patients during the bridge-to-transplant time period.

One of the major concerns with assist devices is thrombosis, which can be a product of device fluid mechanics and therefore needs to be studied. Planar 2D particle image velocimetry has been used to observe whole field fluid mechanics of assist devices in the past. However, the decreased volume and increased curvature of the pediatric device has lead to more three-dimensionality, which makes the flow more difficult to interpret using 2D measurements. In this study planar measurements both parallel and normal to the diaphragm of the PVAD we acquired for the first time, in order to better analyze incidences of three-dimensionality. Measurements were taken in three planes parallel to the diaphragm and in six planes normal to the diaphragm, three in each of the ports. An acrylic model of the PVAD was placed in a mock circulatory loop that used a viscoelastic blood analog as a fluid. Both velocity flow maps and wall shear maps were obtained for each of the planes. The planes normal to the diaphragm confirmed flow features previously seen in the parallel planes including formation of the inlet jet, rotation within the device and areas of flow separation. The normal planes also identified new features, such as areas of regurgitation and stagnation. Obtaining data in the normal planes of the device helped to further understand the three-dimensional nature of the PVAD flow.

The device fluid mechanics are of importance, because a major problem is thromboembolic events, which can be prevented in pulsatile VADs with adequate wall shear rates (>500 s-1). In order to observe the PVAD flow particle image velocimetry was performed on an acrylic model of the PVAD in a mock circulatory loop. Two flow rate reduction studies were performed. The first used a beat rate reduction protocol, focused on 50 and 75 bpm. This study found that a beat rate reduction led to flow more conducive to thrombus deposition, and would not be recommended for weaning. The second used a stroke volume reduction protocol that incrementally reduced the device output from 100 to 40%, and included two filling methods, a quick and slow fill. The study found that the quick fill method produced desirable flow in the PVAD for stroke volumes of 100% to 60%, and the fluid dynamics were preferable over the beat rate reduction method. The slow fill method showed poor flow and is not recommended. The study also found that regardless of the filling method, a reduction in stroke volume below 60% led to greatly reduced wall shear rates that could increase the thrombogenicity of the device. These conclusions are also based on a newly developed thrombus susceptibility potential metric that incorporates wall shear rate information into a single metric to be used for comparison of device variations.

Despite this remarkable pace\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014there have been relatively few efforts to understand how interactive maps should be designed and used. This research directly contributes to this gap, treating the topic of cartographic interaction as a complement to cartographic representation, the traditional topic of inquiry within the field of Cartography. Cartographic interaction is described as the dialogue between a human and a map mediated through a computing device. The dissertation seeks to establish a science of cartographic interaction by accomplishing three research goals.\nThe first research goal of the dissertation is to identify and explore the questions that need to be addressed by a science of cartographic interaction and then to review and synthesize the current state of understanding regarding these questions. Secondary sources from Cartography and related fields were reviewed to understand the current state of science regarding cartographic interaction. This review revealed a framework comprising six questions that a science of cartographic interaction must address: (1) what?, (2) why?, (3) when?, (4) who?, (5) where?, and (6) how? The background review on the sixth how? question also yielded a new way of conceptualizing and organizing existing taxonomies of cartographic interaction primitives\u2014or the basic building blocks that altogether constitute an interaction strategy\u2014based on the stage of interaction. Following the background review, a set of interviews then was completed with 21 participants who use cartographic interaction to support their daily work. The interview study captured the current state of practice on cartographic interaction across a number of application domains, generating additional insights into the six questions on cartographic interaction.\nThe second research goal is to address the important how? question by developing a taxonomy of cartographic interaction primitives that is empirically derived. To this end, a pair of card sorting studies were administered with 15 participants who design and develop cartographic interfaces. The pair of studies required each participant to sort a universe of statements, drawn from the reviews on cartographic science and practice, that represented either the objective or operator stage of interaction. The resulting taxonomy of cartographic interaction primitives includes four dimensions, each aligning with a different stage of interaction: (1) goals (procure, predict, and prescribe), (2) operands (space-alone, attributes-in-space, and space-in-time), (3) objectives (identify, compare, rank, associate, and delineate), and (4) operators (enabling operators: import, export, save, edit, and annotate; work operators: reexpress, arrange, sequence, resymbolize, overlay, reproject, pan, zoom, filter, search, retrieve, and calculate). \nFinally, the third and final research goal is to identify prototypically successful and unsuccessful cartographic interaction strategies with a single cartographic interface, initializing a research program for developing a syntactics of cartographic interaction primitives. To this end, a cartographic interface\u2014referred to as GeoVISTA CrimeViz\u2014was used as a 'living laboratory' for generating initial insight into the interaction primitive taxonomy. Ten law enforcement personnel from the Harrisburg Bureau of Police completed fifteen user tasks with GeoVISTA CrimeViz that are representative of the objective and operand pairings listed in the taxonomy of cartographic interaction primitives. Analysis of the interaction logs by operator allowed for generation of several insights into the syntactics of interaction primitives as well as the development of user personas, or chronic user issues in applying the operator primitives. \nThe research reported here represents a substantial step forward regarding the science of cartographic interaction. However, the there is still much work to be done; the insights generated by the dissertation research offer an initial foundation for structuring future scientific research on cartographic interaction.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5139], "author_name_tesi": "Roth, Robert Emmett", "last_name_ssi": "Roth", "middle_name_ssi": "Emmett", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Alan M Mac Eachren", "Alan Maceachren", "Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Alexander Klippel", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Alan M Mac Eachren, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Committee Member", "Alexander Klippel, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interaction strategies", "Cartography", "Human-Computer Interaction interaction primitives", "Geovisualization", "cartographic interaction", "Geovisual Analytics", "operands", "interactive maps", "cartographic interfaces", "operators", "objectives"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Inconvenience of Haphazard Sampling\n\n", "id": "12352", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6411", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Targeting specific populations can be an arduous task in survey research. While the ability of researchers to use intricate sampling techniques to build a geographically representative population has increased over the last fifty years, the ability to parse together a representative subsample of certain social characteristics has had less success.

However, constructing a sampling frame of hidden populations, such as homeless youths or prostitutes, will still consist of using non-random techniques. Many people who share certain characteristics will likely fall in between these extremes. This study looks at a data set, compiled by Greenburg Quinlan Rosner and named Religion and America\u2019s Role in the World (RARW), which compared a nationally representative sample with a subsample of young evangelical Christians. The researchers used a random digit dial to recruit one-fourth of these young evangelicals into a telephone survey, and an internet opt-in, or convenience sample, to recruit the other three-fourths of the evangelicals into a web survey. This mixed-method, mixed-selection strategy poses many interesting methodological questions about representativeness, bias, and the use of post-adjustment strategies. By looking for skew in demographic variables between sample types, and then looking at the sample types in predicting outcome variables to detect bias, it will be possible to look into the first two issues. The use of post-adjustment strategies for dealing with non-random bias is analyzed. Finally, conclusions are presented about the veracity of results of non-probability samples and the advantages and disadvantages of these samples and their post-collection adjustment methods.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6412], "author_name_tesi": "Roth, Veronica Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Roth", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Veronica", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Johnson", "David R Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Johnson, Thesis Advisor", "David R Johnson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["inverse probability weights", "nonprobability samples", "propensity score weights", "bias"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Detecting & Adjusting for Attrition Bias in Longitudinal Survey Panels", "id": "26344", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11667", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of panel studies, in which the same people are interviewed at least twice in two different time periods, provides researchers with the ability to explore a multitude of issues.

Moreover, performance differences between boys and girls have been reported, although with less consistency. Contextual factors and target properties have been proposed as playing a role for the observed age and sex effects although approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, including perceptual-motor systems, have been more concentrated to adult populations.\n In this experiment we investigated the effect of target velocity and gravity influences on children\u2019s age-related interceptive performance. There were 4 levels of gravity and 4 levels of velocity applied to the target trajectory. Interception accuracy, response latency, movement time and performance scores for interceptions were measured in 4 age groups of participants 7-8, 11-12, 15-16 and 19-20 years of age (n = 10). The targets to be intercepted were presented on a digital graphics tablet using a custom program that simulated aspects of baseball. The performance score was given for each trial that resulted in a positive hit and represented the distance the target/ball travelled after being struck. It was hypothesized that younger children would exhibit longer response latencies and movement times as the speed of information processing would be negatively correlated with experience. It was anticipated that girls would attain lower performance scores compared to boys as contextual factors, as opposed to biological factors, are more likely to augment the males\u2019 responses as the current task demands are more similar to activities engaged by boys at younger ages.\n The results showed that younger children performed with the least amount of accuracy and were affected more by higher target velocity. Girls age 7-8 years initially exhibited less accuracy in interception but had significantly greater accuracy compared to males age at 11-12 years. Despite reaching a mature level of accuracy at an earlier age, females\u2019 distance scores remained lower compared to boys across all ages. The persistence of speed-coupling effects, correlating effector response earlier or later for faster or slower moving targets, respectively, is taken as evidence that target velocity is a critical factor in the perceptual-motor system. The large difference in performance between younger and older children, and adolescents and adults may reflect a less developed perceptual system and/or a more rudimentary method for predicting target locations. The greater sensitivity of younger children to changes in target behavior whether explained in terms of a developmental process augmenting the perceptual system, motor system, or both in concert remains unexplained. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [432], "author_name_tesi": "Rothenberg-Cunningham, Alek ", "last_name_ssi": "Rothenberg-Cunningham", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alek", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["coincidence-anticipation", "interception", "spatiotemporal"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Perception-action coupling in interceptive tasks", "id": "23560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10653", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A central issue for the theory of perception-action coupling is the identification and characterization of information that constrains and influences the emerging movement behavior exhibited by humans and other animals.  We addressed the question of what information at the levels of the environment and the performer is coupled in interceptive actions and how this coupling is influenced by manipulations to the environmental and task objectives.  We examined the temporal coordination of interceptive striking actions by measuring the kinematic information of time-to-peak velocity (TPV) relative to the environmental information of time-to-contact (TTC) that were unified in a dimensionless variable in the form of the ratio of TTC:TPV that could indicate underlying movement strategies for accomplishing given task objectives.\nIn Experiment 1 the TTC:TPV ratio indicated that a similar strategy of making contact while the effector is positively accelerating was used by younger and older children, adolescents, and adults for the task of striking a target for maximal distance.  The evidence showed that the strength of the coupling between TPV and TTC increased with age and that for all age groups the TTC:TPV ratio varied only slightly in comparison to the magnitude of change in the independent kinematic variable of target velocity.  It was also revealed that the structure of the TTC:TPV ratio was different for hits and touches (i.e. foul balls), with hits characterized by lower overall values of both TTC and TPV, and a closer temporal mapping of TPV with TTC for hits compared to touches.  These findings are evidence that the TTC:TPV ratio is consistent with the concept of an invariant characteristic. \nIn Experiment 2 we found evidence that the TTC:TPV ratio was influenced differentially by the spatiotemporal constraints imposed by target velocity and distance criteria.  However, the magnitude of change in the independent variables was much greater compared to the amount of change in the TTC:TPV ratio that was shown to decrease with increasing target velocity and increase as distance criteria required that the target be struck farther. This is evidence that further supports the TTC:TPV ratio as an invariant characteristic that facilitates stable performance in striking targets with sub-maximal effector velocity at TTC and is consistent with the concept of non-linearity in the relationship between the changing environmental information and the action relevant information.  \nIn Experiment 3 we manipulated the velocity of the target and the duration of time that the target was visible from the outset of target motion for the task of striking the target for maximal distance.  The results showed that the maximal distance and dispersion of the distance scores decreased as visual occlusion time increased, and to a greater degree for slower moving compared to faster moving targets.  This is evidence that is consistent with the theory of direct perception that assumes that action is coordinated in concert with the availability of the perceptual information most relevant to the task.  A confounding effect of target vision time and distance of target trajectory was revealed in a strategy whereby participants initiated movement earlier, presumably in order to close the distance between the effector and target before occlusion onset.  The TTC:TPV ratio indicated that targets were struck later after peak effector velocity with increasing visual occlusion, with larger overall values of the ratio at the lower target velocity.  Again, the difference of change in the TTC:TPV ratio was non-linear with respect to the magnitude of change in the independent variables.  These results show that the TTC:TPV ratio does capture and describe the adaptations in striking movements that occur as a result of the influence of task and environmental constraints.\nOverall, the experiments showed that environmental information supports the coordination of perception in action and that the temporal organization of the striking action was influenced by changes in the task and environmental constraints.  The increasing strength of the coupling of TTC and TPV with age implicates the TTC:TPV ratio as an affordance for action in that it furnishes the performer a functional temporal structure for coordinating peak effector velocity relative to TTC.  Finally, the non-linear shift in the TTC:TPV ratio relative to the degree of change in the kinematic independent variables in all tasks implicates a facilitating role of the TTC:TPV ratio in stabilizing interceptive  performance, consistent with the concept of an attractor, for these striking tasks.  The findings support the proposition that TTC:TPV ratio is an organizational variable for temporal coordination of movement kinematics relative to environmental information.\nThe unified, dimensionless value of the TTC:TPV ratio has implications for perception-action coupling research that seeks, in part, to characterize movement coordination in terms of a variable that reflects a \u201ccompression\u201d of information (Turvey, 1990) that is geared towards achieving a movement solution despite an abundance of information.  Consistent with a dynamical systems approach to the organization and coordination action, the TTC:TPV ratio is shown as a variable that represents a stable, self-organized movement pattern that can adapt to meet different demands imposed by changing constraints.  The TTC:TPV ratio also highlights the dependence of the performer on the availability of environmental information for coordinating movement kinematics, as outlined by James Gibson\u2019s (1979) theory of direct perception.  Further work could include developing a spatial ratio counterpart to the TTC:TPV ratio and a unification of both spatial and temporal facets in a dimensionless variable that characterizes spatiotemporal movement organization for interceptive striking tasks.  The implications from such a development can impact several facets of skill development and coordination that include both perceptual and action processes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10285], "author_name_tesi": "Rothenberg-Cunningham, Alek ", "last_name_ssi": "Rothenberg-Cunningham", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell", "John Henry Challis", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Rick Owen Gilmore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Chair", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perception", "Interception", "time-to-contact", "time-to-peak velocity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Interactive Multimedia Framework for Education on Vehicle Electrification", "id": "14537", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7330", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents an interactive multimedia framework for introducing middle school students to vehicle electrification and hybridization. This framework is important because it familiarizes the target audience with the societal factors driving the development of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the different fundamental layouts of HEVs including their components and operating principles, the high-level performance constraints and tradeoffs inherent in the HEV design process, and the process of mitigating competing objectives inherent to engineering design. \n\nResearchers in the field of engineering pedagogy are designing educational solutions for middle school students composed of simulations and team-based design projects to teach core science and engineering principles. This research shows that students gain a better understanding of engineering concepts and design through collaboration [1,3]. While these strategies are improving test scores among students, surveys still show they are only gaining the interest of students already involved in the study of engineering topics. Researchers in educational videogame design are constructing a process to implement learning objectives directly into interactive videogame environments [5,6]. Many studies have shown that videogame environments greatly increase motivation in students who are playing them, but still struggle to incorporate a method to allow for reasonable knowledge retention [4,6,11].\n\nThis thesis adds three novel contributions to the engineering education and educational videogame design literature.

Identifiability is a property from information theory that determines the solvability of parameter estimation for mathematical models using input-output measurements. This dissertation creates a framework that exploits the Fisher information metric to quantify the level of battery parameter identifiability, optimizes this metric through input shaping, and facilitates faster and more accurate estimation.\n\nThe popularity of lithium-ion batteries is growing significantly in the energy storage domain, especially for stationary and transportation applications. While these cells have excellent power and energy densities, they are plagued with safety and lifespan concerns. These concerns are often resolved in the industry through conservative current and voltage operating limits, which reduce the overall performance and still lack robustness in detecting catastrophic failure modes. New advances in automotive battery management systems mitigate these challenges through the incorporation of model-based control to increase performance, safety, and lifespan. To achieve these goals, model-based control requires accurate parameterization of the battery model. While many groups in the literature study a variety of methods to perform battery parameter estimation, a fundamental issue of poor parameter identifiability remains apparent for lithium-ion battery models.\n\nThis fundamental challenge of battery identifiability is studied extensively in the literature, and some groups are even approaching the problem of improving the ability to estimate the model parameters. The first approach is to add additional sensors to the battery to gain more information that is used for estimation. The other main approach is to shape the input trajectories to increase the amount of information that can be gained from input-output measurements, and is the approach used in this dissertation. Research in the literature studies optimal current input shaping for high-order electrochemical battery models and focuses on offline laboratory cycling. While this body of research highlights improvements in identifiability through optimal input shaping, each optimal input is a function of nominal parameters, which creates a tautology. The parameter values must be known a priori to determine the optimal input for maximizing estimation speed and accuracy. The system identification literature presents multiple studies containing methods that avoid the challenges of this tautology, but these methods are absent from the battery parameter estimation domain.\n\nThe gaps in the above literature are addressed in this dissertation through the following five novel and unique contributions. First, this dissertation optimizes the parameter identifiability of a thermal battery model, which Sergio Mendoza experimentally validates through a close collaboration with this dissertation\u2019s author. Second, this dissertation extends input-shaping optimization to a linear and nonlinear equivalent-circuit battery model and illustrates the substantial improvements in Fisher identifiability for a periodic optimal signal when compared against automotive benchmark cycles. Third, this dissertation presents an experimental validation study of the simulation work in the previous contribution. The estimation study shows that the automotive benchmark cycles either converge slower than the optimized cycle, or not at all for certain parameters. Fourth, this dissertation examines how automotive battery packs with additional power electronic components that dynamically route current to individual cells/modules can be used for parameter identifiability optimization. While the user and vehicle supervisory controller dictate the current demand for these packs, the optimized internal allocation of current still improves identifiability. Finally, this dissertation presents a robust Bayesian sequential input shaping optimization study to maximize the conditional Fisher information of the battery model parameters without prior knowledge of the nominal parameter set. This iterative algorithm only requires knowledge of the prior parameter distributions to converge to the optimal input trajectory.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11769], "author_name_tesi": "Rothenberger, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Rothenberger", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Sean Brennan", "Joel Robert Anstrom", "Christopher Rahn", "Jack W Langelaan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hosam Kadry Fathy, Dissertation Advisor", "Sean Brennan, Committee Member", "Joel Robert Anstrom, Special Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Jack W Langelaan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fisher identifiability optimization", "battery parameter estimation", "lithium-ion battery", "optimal input shaping"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Civil Wars and Reconstructions in America: The United States, Mexico, and Argentina, 1860-1880", "id": "14375ecr5102", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation makes three arguments. First, it insists the time period of this study, 1860-1880, was not simply an era of discrete civil wars. Rather, this was a period in which many individual conflicts \u2013 the Wars of Unification in Argentina, the U.S. Civil War, and the French Intervention in Mexico \u2013 formed a larger war pitting democracy and republicanism against monarchy and aristocracy. Many people understood the entangled nature of their world. Soldiers circulated from one country to another and fought in wars seemingly not their own. Policymakers ignored violations of neutrality laws. Mexicans began celebrating the Fourth of July. This was a time of rapprochement, particularly between the U.S. and Mexico, where much of the hatred and bitterness engendered by the U.S. War with Mexico evaporated.\n\nSecond, this dissertation argues that the period covered by this study was a Pan-American moment marked more by cooperation among the people of the U.S., Mexico, and Argentina than conflict. The historiography overemphasizes anti-Latin American sentiment. However, people in all three countries corresponded with each other, traveled to different nations, and worked to create stronger economic, political, and cultural ties.\n\nThird, it contends that all three countries faced similar problems of order and disorder, not a problem of Mexicanization. In other words, while Mexico was often disordered and chaotic during this period, so too were the United States and Argentina. Victors had to pacify people who did not subscribe to their worldview. How victors sought to impose order and how the vanquished and some discontented victors resisted, reveals a common, if not identical, hemispheric history.

In contrast, I argue that these phenomena are fundamentally linked: NAFTA\u2019s role as a policy of exchange cannot be understood separately from the cultural responses to the agreement itself. Indeed, I claim that the post-NAFTA repercussions and cultural products need to be analyzed together to establish the common characteristics of what I articulate as NAFTA Culture.\n\nI present the concept of NAFTA Culture to suggest that there is a strong and revelatory link between NAFTA and the cultural products connected\u2014both deliberately and circumstantially\u2014to it. I link divergent cultural forums, which include the textual production surrounding the Zapatista social movement, cinema from the Hollywood and Mexican film industries, and the \u201cRecovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage\u201d Project, a publishing initiative situated in the US academy, to analyze both the specific tensions between the United States and Mexico and the broad-ranging effects globalization has on local cultures or in creating a global culture. I expose the ethical dilemmas of the power differential and double standards created by NAFTA, but in comparing various forums for cultural response, I challenge the expectation that individual responses simply support or oppose globalization policies. I bring to light the ability of individuals to respond to globalization forces in their own ways.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7529], "author_name_tesi": "Rothlisberger, Leisa ", "last_name_ssi": "Rothlisberger", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Leisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sophia A Mcclennen", "John Andres Ochoa", "Sean X Goudie", "Amara Leah Solari"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sophia A Mcclennen, Dissertation Advisor", "John Andres Ochoa, Committee Member", "Sean X Goudie, Committee Member", "Amara Leah Solari, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NAFTA", "US-Mexico relation", "Hemispheric American studies", "film industry", "Zapatistas", "Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Gentrification and Parent Engagement in an Urban School Community:  A Study of Scoieoeconomic Disparity in Philadelphia", "id": "14346arb184", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contributes to a growing research focus on interactive effects of urban housing and education policy within gentrifying urban neighborhoods.

With daily fluctuations in available nutrients, milk synthesis may also vary over the day.  Additionally, milk synthesis has been shown to fluctuate independently of nutrient availability, which would create times over the day that the nutrient profile does not match the nutritional needs of the mammary gland.  Two studies were conducted to examine the circadian patterns of the dairy cow and to understand the relationship between timing of feed intake and milk synthesis.\nThe object of the first experiment was to characterize the effect of timing of feed intake on the pattern of milk synthesis.  The treatments for this experiment were cows fed once a day (1x fed) or every six hours in four equal meals (4x fed).  The cows were milked twice a day for the first 14 d and then four times a day for the last 7 d of each period.  There was a circadian pattern to milk and milk component synthesis over the day.  Milk yield was high during the first milking interval (MI), decreased over the next two milking intervals, and for the 1x fed increased during the last milking interval but remained lower for 4x fed.  Milk protein fluctuated over the day as well.  Milk protein percent for both treatments peaked during the third milking interval with 4x fed peaking higher than 1x fed.  The largest range was observed for milk fat over the day.  The second and third milking interval exhibited the highest milk fat concentration and yield.  The 4x fed was consistently higher in fat percent at each timepoint, but milk fat yield was only higher during the first two milking intervals.  Non-esterified fatty acids were the only plasma metabolite with an effect of time, but no effect of treatment.  The experiment demonstrated a clear pattern to milk yield and milk component synthesis that is affected by the timing of feed intake.  \nThe object of the second experiment was to identify a feeding regimen that complements the natural pattern of feed intake and milk synthesis.  Cows were fed either a control diet (30.1% NDF) or two regimens that consisted of a combination of a high fiber diet (31.8% NDF) and a low fiber diet (26.9% NDF).  The treatments for the experiments were the control diet fed at 0800 h (Con), the high fiber diet fed at 0800 h and the low fiber diet at 2200 h (HL), and the low fiber diet fed at 0800 h and high fiber diet at 1300 h (LH).  The high and low fiber diets were fed at a ratio to provide the same nutrients as the control diet.  Feeding times were selected to provide the rumen with a low fiber diet either during the high or low intake period of the day. There was a tendency for lower daily milk fat yield (P < 0.07) and fat corrected milk (FCM; P < 0.07) for HL compared to LH.  There was a treatment effect for DMI (P = 0.01) with Con consuming 1.9 kg more than HL, but there was no difference between HL and LH.  There was no effect of treatment on empty body weight.  There was also no treatment effect to plasma metabolites, but as reported in the first experiment, there was an effect of time (P < 0.001 for all treatments).  There was no treatment effect on VFA concentrations, but there was a tendency for a treatment by time interaction for valerate (P = 0.07).  All VFA concentrations peaked at approximately1800 h and the acetate to propionate ratio peaked at 1200 h.  Splitting the TMR ration into two separate rations that differ in their fiber level and feeding these at specific times over the day, decreases DMI with minimal effects on milk production.  Lastly, there was a tendency for feed efficiency to be higher for LH compared to HL (P = 0.096).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3856], "author_name_tesi": "Rottman, Lauren Whitney", "last_name_ssi": "Rottman", "middle_name_ssi": "Whitney", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin John Harvatine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin John Harvatine, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["dairy cow", "pattern of feed intake", "circadian", "milk synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "HIGH-FREQUENCY FORECASTING MODELS OF NATIONAL ACCOUNT VARIABLES IN TRANSITION ECONOMIES (RUSSIA, ARMENIA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC)", "id": "6719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "535", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study shows that despite the shortness of time-series and significant structural change the economies of three transition countries \u2013 Russia, Armenia, and the Czech Republic \u2013 have started to demonstrate regularities that can be used in some types of econometric forecasting. The high-frequency models developed here generate relatively accurate short-term forecasts of quarterly national account variables, overall 53 for the three countries, and ultimately real GDP. They can serve as a foundation for real-time short-term forecasting models and can provide initial conditions for medium-term or long-term structural forecasting models. \n\nGovernment agencies and business analysts worldwide monitor high-frequency information that is released on a monthly and or even more frequent basis to estimate lower frequency data, such as quarterly national account data, before reports on these data are released. Such estimates are important, for example, in the preparation of government budgets. For example, the U.S. Treasury Department routinely uses high-frequency modeling to project GDP and tax receipts. The timeliness of these estimates may be critical near business-cycle peaks and troughs, since the government needs time to prepare counter-cyclical measures. The models that I have developed may help the governments of transition countries in economic policy decision-making. \n\nThe two main methodological features of the models \u2013 the forecasting of real GDP directly and through its elements and the method of principal components \u2013 allow for the incorporation of a large number of explanatory variables. The selected complex forecasting regressions satisfy a series of absolute and comparative forecast accuracy criteria, and this study shows that forecasting accuracy improves if the model takes into account signals from a large variety of indicators.\n\nChapter 1 describes the model methodology, forecast accuracy testing, and statistical problems. Chapter 2 provides a review of relevant literature. It focuses on the place of the model among forecasting approaches, compares the costs and benefits of the methodology applied here with those of other methods, and discusses practical applications. Chapter 3 describes economic growth trends in the three countries and the indicators that are generally considered growth determinants.

We use seismic data from the 27-station Ethiopian Broadband Seismic Experiment and the 29-station Ethiopian Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Experiment to obtain Pn travel times for ~300 local and regional events.  The Pn travel times have been inverted for Pn velocities using a standard singular value decomposition method, and the results show a low velocity zone in the uppermost mantle beneath both the northern Main Ethiopian rift (NMER) (7.4-7.5 km/s) and SMER (7.5-7.7 km/s).  In contrast, an area of higher velocities is found under the central Main Ethiopian rift (CMER) (7.7-7.9 km/s).

My chapters are anchored on performances, caricatures, comic strips and stand-up comedies because each illuminates Franco-Algerian relations in a different way.

However, the effects of a dietary pattern that meets dietary recommendations for SFA (<7% calories) and includes lean beef on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors have not been evaluated.  \n\nObjective:  To examine the effects of a cholesterol-lowering diet containing lean beef (BOLD 4.0 oz/d; BOLD+ 5.4 oz/d) on low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and compare these effects to an Average American Diet (AAD).\n\nDesign:  Thirty six moderately hypercholesterolemic individuals (LDL-C >110 mg/dL) completed a randomized crossover controlled feeding study.  Participants were fed 4 interventions diets; AAD [33% total fat, 12% SFA, 49% carbohydrate (CHO), 19% protein (PRO), 0.7 oz beef/d], DASH (27% total fat, 6% SFA, 50% CHO, 19% PRO, 1.0oz beef/d), BOLD (28% total fat, 6% SFA, 54% CHO, 19% PRO, 4.0 oz beef/d), and BOLD+ (28% total fat, 6% SFA, 46% CHO, 28% PRO, 5.4 oz beef/d) for five weeks with a 1 week washout between diets.  Lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, blood pressure (BP), blood vessel function, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Heme oxgense-1 (HO-1) were measured at the beginning of the intervention and at the end of each diet period.  Equations were developed to predict TG and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) changes from AAD based on changes in food group intakes (recommended by MyPyramid.gov and the DASH diet) between DASH, BOLD, BOLD+ and AAD.  \n\nResults:  There were significant reductions (p<0.05) in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C in response to the DASH (-19.0 \u00b14.3 and -14.4 \u00b13.7 mg/dL), BOLD (-18.6 \u00b14.1 and -13.5 \u00b13.6 mg/dL), and BOLD+ (-19.6\u00b14.1 and -13.5 \u00b13.8 mg/dL) diets versus the AAD (-8.5 \u00b14.1 and -5.5 \u00b13.9 mg/dL).  Systolic BP (SBP) was only significantly reduced following the BOLD+ diet compared to AAD (-4.24 mm Hg).  Significant reductions also were observed for Apo A1, Apo C-III, and Apo C-III bound to Apo A1 particles following the BOLD and BOLD+ (p<0.05) compared to AAD. Arterial stiffness was reduced following the BOLD (10.37 \u00b1 3.0%) diet compared to AAD (14.47 \u00b1 3.6%), with no other changes in vascular function. \n\tThere were no significant differences between the  HDL-C changes predicted using previously validated equations, and the MyPyramid.gov food group model or the DASH diet food group model.  \n\tHO-1 levels remained unchanged throughout the intervention. No significant changes were observed in relative gene expression of HO-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2, gp91phox, or Biliverdin IX&#945; reductase mRNA in response to the dietary treatments.\n\nConclusions:  In conclusion, lean beef can be included in a cholesterol-lowering diet that is controlled for SFA; this dietary pattern elicits reductions in TC and LDL-C that are equivalent to heart-healthy plant protein-rich diets, such as the DASH diet.  In addition, increasing total dietary protein by including lean beef and other animal proteins also is an effective strategy for reducing BP. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3961], "author_name_tesi": "Roussell, Michael  A", "last_name_ssi": "Roussell", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Michael ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Trent Gaugler", "Sheila Grace West", "Peter Gillies", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Trent Gaugler, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Peter Gillies, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lean beef", "saturated fat", "cardiovascular disease", "nutrition", "red meat"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Determining Optimum Conditions For Dual Time Stepping Using Convergence Acceleration Techniques in Computational Aeroacoustics", "id": "23656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10802", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Computational Aeroacoustics(CAA) involves a large quantity of complex calculations.
