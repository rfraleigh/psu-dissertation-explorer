Three main research questions were examined: (1) the effect of self-motivation on perceptions of media effects; (2) the role of self-esteem in evaluating media influences; and (3) the question of whether people estimate beneficial media influences in ways that are consistent with the ego-enhancive mechanism or the ego-defensive mechanism.\nIn Experiment 1, self-enhancement motivation was manipulated by threats to self-worth. The literature suggested that threats to self-worth increase self-enhancement needs for securing a positive self-view. To explore this suggestion, participants received either a threat to their cognitive ability or a threat to their sense of compassion. They then evaluated media effects on themselves and media effects on others. Third-person perceptions did not vary by threat to self-worth. However, negative effects on the self decreased as self-esteem increased when participants were under threats. First-person perceptions did not vary by threat to self-worth, either. However, under a threat to sense of compassion, self-esteem level negatively correlated with perceived positive effects on the self and on others, which is consistent with the self-enhancement perspective operating through the ego-defensive mechanism. \nIn Experiment 2, self-enhancement motivation was compared with self-assessment motivation in terms of their effects on perceptions of media influences. Self-assessment motivation is thought to decrease needs for self-enhancement. To prime self-enhancement motivation (high need for self-enhancement condition) or self-assessment motivation (low need for self-enhancement condition), participants were asked to describe their personal experiences that had led them to satisfy one of both motivations. Third-person and first-person perceptions did not vary by the extent of self-enhancement motivation. \nThe findings of this suggested that needs for self-enhancement play a role in people\u00a1\u00afs perceptions of media influences. However, people who are high in self-esteem may enhance their positive self-views more evidently than do people who are low in self-esteem. In a first-person perceptions context, it appears that people perceive media influences in a way that is consistent with the ego-defensive mechanism. Alternative explanations for null findings, implications of significant findings, and suggestions for future research are also discussed. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5974], "author_name_tesi": "LEE, SANGKI ", "last_name_ssi": "LEE", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SANGKI", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Oliver", "Fuyuan Shen", "S.

This investigation uses mainly the nature of ferroelectric phase transition to define the relationships between phase equilibria, defect chemistry, and phase transition behavior in non-stoichiometric BaTiO3 under various equilibrium conditions. \nThe phase transition temperature (TC) between the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases was varied systematically with defect concentration, which is controlled by Ba/Ti ratio, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure (PO2). These same variables give rise to changes in the latent heat of transition (&#8710;H). In this study, the limits to the solubility of excess BaO and excess TiO2 in BaTiO3 were determined under well controlled equilibrium conditions. The resulting observation is that the different defect types (such as titanium, barium, and oxygen vacancies) all give rise to different degrees of TC variation. Under low PO2 conditions, the oxygen vacancy concentration affected the TC. Two different types of PO2 effect are noted: First, at intermediate PO2 there is ionic compensation with a constant TC dependence, and second, in the electronically compensated the extreme low PO2 region with an increase of TC. The latent heat and phase transition temperature changed systematically, indicating solid-solution on both the Ba-rich as well as Ti-rich sides of stoichiometric BaTiO3. The solubility limit was greater for the Ti-rich side. The extent of solid-solution on the Ba-rich side was much larger than previously believed. From these measurements, the solubility behavior was determined and analyzed with defect chemical reactions. Self-consistent data were obtained and successfully modeled, analytically, with defect reactions as a function of Ba/Ti, temperature, and oxygen partial pressure (PO2).\nFinally, Landau-Devonshire theory was used to assess the compositional dependence of the ferroelectric properties in the solid solution regimes. From the TC, &#8710;H, and thermal hysteresis data, higher order coefficients of the Landau phenomenological theory were determined and used to predict the spontaneous polarization, electrostriction coefficients, dielectric constants, etc. These values are in substantial agreement with previously reported data. Thus, it was shown clearly that TC and &#8710;H offer excellent experimental insight into the coupling between point defects and phase transition behavior.\nThis study revised the BaO-TiO2-x phase diagram, determined the defect chemistry of BaTiO3, and provided reliable enthalpies of defect formation for the partial Schottky reactions: 2.32\u00b10.1eV for BaO partial Schottky and 2.89\u00b10.3eV for TiO2 partial Schottky. Also determined are the relationships between TC and defect concentration, and the compositional dependence of the Landau coefficients. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions linking phase equilibria, defect equilibrium, and phase transition theory for the BaTiO3 system. The methodology is general, and can be applied to other systems with first order phase transitions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5834], "author_name_tesi": "LEE, SOON IL ", "last_name_ssi": "LEE", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SOON IL", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "Dr Zi Kui Liu", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Dr Susan Trolier Mc Kinstry", "Elizabeth C Dickey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Dr Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Dr Susan Trolier Mc Kinstry, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["BaTiO3", "defect chemistry", "ferroelectric phase transition", "phase equilibria", "Landau theory", "ferroelectric properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The growth retardation and liver dysfunction of PERK knockout mice", "id": "7744", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mutations of PKR-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) eIF2alpha kinase cause\nmultiple phenotypes in both human and mice.

The case of the American digital television transition is especially intriguing because of its three-fold peculiarity. First, its standard-setting process is a hybrid of both market- and committee-based decision methods. The finally adopted standard is regarded as an atypical standard because it allows multiple formats, which range from high definition to standard definition. Second, while the U.S. digital television transition is government-mandated, it follows a flexible timetable. On one hand, Congress requires all the stations to complete the transition by February 17, 2009, on the other hand, Congress permits transition delays for many stations. Third, in spite of the government mandate, the digital adoption pattern is highly associated with the market performance and firm behavior of broadcast stations. This study focuses on three firm- and market-specific factors\u2014firm size, age and business grouping\u2014to investigate their possible impacts on stations\u2019 adoption choice of digital television.\n\nSurvival analysis and a competing risks model are employed to examine stations\u2019 format choices. The results show that old and established stations tend to adopt high-definition format sooner, but it takes less time for young stations to adopt standard-definition format. The findings suggest that the financial difficulty of digital television transition may have been eased by the flexibility obtained by having multiple formats. The standard choice in digital television transition is also likely to introduce new business models for traditional broadcast stations. Profit-motivated decision making by individual television stations influenced their format selection.  Large stations interested in preserving market power chose the high-definition (HDTV) format, while smaller stations interested in reducing cost and experimenting with new business models chose the standard-definition (SDTV) format. The relaxed transition timetable suggests that the regulator has been industry friendly. However, the regulator failed to boost viewers\u2019 awareness of digital television. To ease the difficulty associated with technology adoption, it is recommended for regulators to activate a friendly environment for both firms and consumers.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4986], "author_name_tesi": "LIAO, PINJIA ", "last_name_ssi": "LIAO", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "PINJIA", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Jorge R Schement", "Carleen Frances Maitland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Committee Chair", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "Jorge R Schement, Committee Member", "Carleen Frances Maitland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["digital television", "standard transition", "technology adoption", "survival analysis", "broadcast television industry", "media economics"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "ESSAYS IN COLLABORATIVE SUPPLY CHAINS:\nINFORMATION SHARING, EVENT MANAGEMENT\nAND PROCESS VERIFICATION", "id": "7183", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5345", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the advent of information technology in a highly interconnected economy, supply chains are required to be agile and adaptive. An agile and adaptive supply chain can sense changes or events in real time and respond to them quickly by self adjustment. This adjustment involves changes in information sharing and supply chain processes. Therefore, information sharing, event management, and process modeling and verification play an important role. In this dissertation, each of these issues is addressed in a separate essay. Therefore, this dissertation consists of three interrelated essays.\nThe first essay describes a new methodology for achieving supply chain configurations by dynamic information sharing. We propose a parameterized model to analyze information sharing. By changing the parameters of this model, we actually adjust information sharing needs and achieve different supply chain configurations, which are further evaluated in terms of supply chain performance. When events or changes bring new information sharing needs, we can respond to the needs with suitable configurations. \nThe second essay focuses on supply chain events. A formal approach based on colored time Petri nets is developed to model and analyze events. Based on Petri net models, we derive dependency graphs to analyze causal relationships between events. We also perform sensitivity analysis to show the impact of different event resolution strategies on supply chain performance.\nThe third essay models and verifies supply chain processes based on workflow technologies. Inter-organizational processes are usually complicated and unstructured. We describe a taxonomy that serves as a framework for analyzing unstructured workflows. The taxonomy characterizes unstructured workflows in terms of two considerations: improper nesting and mismatched pairs.  Based on this taxonomy, we develop a diagnosis algorithm that can detect structural flaws, show causes of flaws and draw conclusions on workflow correctness.  \nBased on the results of these three essays, we are able to develop a technical architecture for agile and adaptive supply chains. This architecture contains an event management engine to detect and analyze events. Suitable configurations are selected in response to events. Finally, processes are carefully verified to ensure accurate information sharing and supply chain configurations. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5340], "author_name_tesi": "LIU, RONG ", "last_name_ssi": "LIU", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "RONG", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Akhil Kumar", "Dawn M Russell", "Alan J Stenger", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Akhil Kumar, Committee Chair", "Dawn M Russell, Committee Member", "Alan J Stenger, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information sharing", "supply chain event management", "Petri nets", "workflows", "process verification", "unstructured workflows"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECTIVENESS OF LEARNER-GENERATED DRAWINGS IN BIOLOGY COMPREHENSION", "id": "14019yxl256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Learner-generated drawing is an effective strategy that can be taught to support learning in Science (Ainsworth, Prain & Tytler, 2011; Van Meter & Garner, 2005).

However, a very few studies have examined both influence and selection processes in integrated network-based frameworks.\nObjectives: This dissertation investigates peer effects on physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and nutrition behaviors in social networks of adolescents.\nMethods: Data from students in a large high school from Wave 1 and Wave 2 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) were analyzed. The study sample included 762 focal students and 2517 dyadic friendships in Wave 1, and 623 focal students and 1903 dyadic friendships in Wave 2. All students were administered interviews in which they provided information on friend nominations, screen time behaviors, and other attributes. Stochastic-actor based models were used to simultaneously model peer influence and peer selection processes.\nResults: As described in Chapter 2, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) of adolescents and their social connections were correlated up to three geodesic distances. Peer effects were significant for MVPA, perception of sleep quality and of being overweight. Perceptions of getting enough sleep and of being overweight partly accounted for peer influence in MVPA. Results in Chapter 3 revealed that male adolescents were influenced by male friends in TV viewing. Female adolescents were influenced by female friends in radio listening. There were no overall significant influences for both sexes. Findings in Chapter 4 showed that peers\u2019 consumption of sugar-sweetened food significantly predicts adolescents\u2019 intake of this food. No significant peer effects were found for dairy product, fruits, and vegetables, suggesting that peers influenced each other in selective eating behaviors.\nDiscussion: The results of this dissertation provide support for incorporating network strategies into weight-related behavior interventions for adolescents, including greater involvement of peers and a focus on multiple determinants of these behaviors.

It has flourished as a winter annual, germinating at the end of summer, maintaining a tall, coarse vegetative growth during the fall and winter, and ending its life cycle in the spring with a prodigious seed set. It lacks the characteristics of a sustainable turf such as heat and drought tolerance and disease resistance. However, fairly recently on an evolutionary time scale, a new biotype of Poa annua has evolved. The \u201cgreens-type\u201d has transformed its life history traits to a perennial type grass exhibiting prolific tiller density, with a dwarfed stature and fine leaf texture. The additionally traits; tolerance to heat and drought, and resistance to anthracnose, pink snow mold, and dollar spot also vary among greens-types. This biotype of P. annua can be found on older elite golf course putting greens, flourishing under mowing heights of a 1/10th of an inch and thus produces an extremely fast, uniform playing surface. In 1927, Piper and Oakley described the perennial, greens-type\u2019s utility in a letter from the USGA; \u201cThe perennial type provides a dense uniform playing surface ideal for putting greens.\u201d \n\nIn the past 80 years there have been three attempts to breed and release an elite commercial cultivar of a \u201cgreens-type\u201d perennial P. annua; the University of California (1950s), the University of Rhode Island (1970s), and the University of Minnesota (1980s-1990s). Nevertheless, all three attempts have failed. The limiting factor that has impeded the release of a commercial cultivar has been the stability of the greens-type\u2019s morphology. During the breeding process, the greens-type is left unmowed to increase seed production. Over the course of several generations without mowing the greens-type biotype is lost and population reverts back to a large, coarse textured annual-type that is functionally and visually unacceptable to the golf course industry. \n\nPresented here is an examination of the greens-type phenotype, its inheritance, instability, and regulation, and breeding for disease resistance in stable greens-types.  The F2 progeny from a Lemon House (annual-type) x PSU 98-2-26 (greens-type) cross were measured for inflorescence branching, culm length, tiller length, leaf length, panicle length, and spikelet number. Preliminary data indicated that the greens-type phenotype linked single branching inflorescences with dwarfed culms, tillers, leaves, panicles, and number of spikelets. The data also suggested that a single recessive gene regulated the greens-type phenotype.  Yet, advanced generation progeny from the Lemon House x PSU 98-2-26 and two greens-type x greens-type populations did not confirm the single gene hypothesis. The inheritance patterns from these populations also failed to conform to tetrasomic or disomic models as well as gene complementation and three and four gene quantitative trait loci models. Finally, the observation of somatic reversions of greens-types sporting annual-type reproductive tillers indicated that the greens-type phenotype is unstable and regulated by a non-mendelian mechanism. \n\n\tThe unstable nature of the greens-type complicated the process of defining an efficient approach to elucidating the mechanism for this phenotype. In the end, a candidate gene approach was taken. While many plant pathways can confer dwarfism through genetic mutation, the greens-type\u2019s response to gibberellic acid narrowed the potential candidates. The GA biosynthetic genes were cloned and used for expression analysis. In the greens-type PSU 98-2-26, GA20oxidase was over-expressed in comparison to the annual-type. These results suggested that greens-type might be deficient in GA biosynthesis; however the greens-types resistance to the synthetic auxin NAA eliminated that possibility. Auxin signaling genes were then cloned and used for expression analysis. The Auxin F-Box gene was down regulated in PSU 98-2-26 and F3 greens-type progeny in comparison with the Lemon House and F3 annual-type progeny. In addition, this gene was suppressed in PSU 98-3-30 and related F5 greens-type progeny. \n\nThe creation of recombinant inbred lines to map dollar spot resistance in greens-type P. annua was severely inhibited by the unstable nature of the greens-type phenotype. A small number of F5 and F7 progeny from the cross of two greens-type parents; PSU 98-3-30 (susceptible), PSU 98-6-27 (resistant) maintained the greens-type phenotype. In the field trial, PSU 98-6-27 was confirmed as being more resistant to dollar spot than PSU 98-3-30. Several progeny were as resistant as PSU 98-6-27 and were significantly more resistant than PSU 98-3-30. On the other end of the spectrum, progeny were found to be significantly more susceptible than PSU 98-3-30. The field results indicated that there may be a resistance QTL within PSU 98-3-30 and therefore may be at least two genes that confer resistance. This also indicates that breeding for dollar spot resistance greater than that of PSU 98-6-27 may be possible. \n\n\tDespite the unstable nature of the greens-type phenotype, it is possible to create transfer traits from one greens-type to another. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that mowing may enable the greens-type phenotype to be inherited to the next generation. Therefore, the breeding and release of the first elite, stable greens-type seeded cultivar may be possible. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2866], "author_name_tesi": "La Mantia, Jonathan ", "last_name_ssi": "La Mantia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Robert Huff", "David Robert Huff", "Surinder Chopra", "Majid R Foolad", "Dawn S Luthe", "Scott Warnke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Robert Huff, Dissertation Advisor", "David Robert Huff, Committee Chair", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Scott Warnke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phenotypic instability", "Auxin F-Box", "greens-type", "Poa annua"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PROCESSING OF LEXICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CUES IN A STUDY ABROAD CONTEXT\n", "id": "9916", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acquiring a second language as an adult can be a difficult task, and much research has been conducted to explain the obstacles associated with adult second language acquisition (SLA). Some research has suggested biological (see Birdsong, 2006; DeKeyser & Larsen-Hall, 2005, for a summary), external (Lantolf, 2000; Long, 1996; Swain, 2000), and internal (VanPatten, 2004; Ellis, 2007) factors to account for these difficulties. The Associative-Cognitive theory (Ellis, 2007) suggests that there is no default mechanism determining what cues are processed, and that it is both linguistic characteristics (cue salience, reliability and redundancy) and language experience (early learned cues in the L1 and L2 affect the learning of later learned cues) that guide the processing of L2 cues. There is mounting evidence that native speakers of a morphologically poor language such as English learning a morphologically richer language such as Spanish or Italian as adults use lexical cues (adverbs) before morphological cues (verbs) when both cues provide information about temporal reference within a sentence (Bardovi-Harlig, 1992; Cadierno, Glass, Lee, & VanPatten, 1991; Lee, 1999, 2002; Jiang, 2004; Leeser, 2004; Musumeci, 1989; Rossomondo, 2003); Sagarra & Ellis, personal communication; VanPatten, 1996, 2004). Similarly, native speakers of a morphologically rich language learning another morphologically rich language show preference for morphological over lexical cues (Ellis & Sagarra, submitted; Jiang, Novokshanova, Masuda, & Wang, 2008; Liu, Bates, & Li, 1992). In addition to these linguistic and language experience factors, instructors\u2019 overuse of lexical items (Dracos, 2009) and underuse of certain morphological forms (Goodall, 2008) poses an additional obstacle for classroom learners\u2019 processing of redundant cues. \nPrevious research suggests that classroom learners with higher working memory capacity are better able to process redundant morphological cues, even at early stages of acquisition (Leeser, 2007; Sagarra, 2007; Sagarra & Ellis, personal communication), than those with lower working memory capacity. Immersion experience and inhibitory control are two other factors that can help classroom learners focus on morphological cues, because naturalistic settings expose learners to great amounts of morphological cues and help them suppress their L1 (Linck, Kroll, & Sunderman, 2009). While there is no direct evidence about what role immersion experience and inhibitory control play in the L2 processing of such cues, studies indicate that in a study abroad setting, better working memory (Lafford, 2006; Tokowicz, Michael, & Kroll, 2004; Sunderman & Kroll, 2009) and inhibitory control (Linck, Hoshino, & Kroll, 2008; Linck, Kroll, & Sunderman,  2009) facilitate the L2 processing of linguistic features, suggesting that an immersion experience, working memory capacity, and inhibitory control can also assist in the L2 processing of morphological cues. The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the effects of these three factors on how Anglophone learners of Spanish process temporal adverbs and verbs to assign temporal reference. Heeding these studies, the predictions are that immersion experience, working memory capacity, and inhibitory control will help classroom learners to rely on morphological cues.\nTo test these predictions, English-Spanish adult classroom learners with (n = 36) and without (n = 24) an immersion experience completed 6 screening tasks (a language background questionnaire, a language contact profile (study abroad only), a test of Spanish proficiency, proficiency self-ratings, a verb recognition test, and tense recognition test), an eyetracking task, a working memory test, and an inhibitory control test. The eyetracking task followed a counterbalanced within-subjects design in which participants read 146 sentences in Spanish at their own pace (6 practice, 40 experimental, 100 fillers) and answered a comprehension question after each sentence. All experimental sentences contained a past tense adverb (lexical cue), but half had past tense verbs (morphological cue) (half adverb-verb, half verb-adverb) and half had present tense verbs (half adverb-verb, half verb-adverb). The working memory test consisted of a modified version of Water\u2019s & Caplan\u2019s (1996b) reading span test and asked participants to read a set of sentences, judge their plausibility, and remember the last word of each sentence. Finally, inhibitory control was measured with the Simon test, which required participants to ignore the position of a target stimulus in order to respond only to its color. \nThe results for the screening tests revealed that the sample pool was homogeneous in terms of L2 proficiency and knowledge of the target verbs and tenses. The findings of the eyetracking task indicated that classroom learners without an immersion experience use lexical cues to resolve a tense conflict, whereas those with an immersion experience show a decreased reliance on lexical cues accompanied by an increased reliance on morphological cues. These data suggest that an immersion experience helps classroom learners acquire native-like processing patterns. This relates to the Associative-Cognitive theory by showing that both linguistic and language experience based factors affect SLA. The results of the reading span test revealed that working memory capacity modulates the processing of morphological cues in study abroad learners but not in non-study abroad learners. When in the study abroad setting, the learners with higher working memory capacity are able to focus on the morphological cues when lexical cues are absent. Finally, the results of the Simon test showed that inhibitory control was not a determinant factor in the processing of lexical or morphological cues for any of the groups. This may be attributed to the data being collected after the study abroad group learners had returned from their immersion experience. Taken as a whole, the findings of this dissertation suggest that immersion experience and the combination of immersion experience and working memory help adult classroom learners attend to morphological cues in the input. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5251], "author_name_tesi": "LaBrozzi, Ryan M", "last_name_ssi": "LaBrozzi", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nuria Sagarra", "Nuria Sagarra", "Nick C Ellis", "John Lipski", "Sandra J.

Diabetes is most common in middle-aged and older adults; and marital dissolution (i.e., divorce and widowhood) is also increasingly common in middle-aged and older adults. Divorce and widowhood have been linked to more limited financial and social resources, poorer health behaviors, and worse mental and physical health, compared to those who remain married. Often there are differences in how divorce and widowhood affect resources and health, with further differences by gender. However, the links between states of marital dissolution and diabetes and its management have not been studied, particularly by gender with a focus on the implications for protection, crisis, and selection theories identified to explain those relationships within lifespan developmental and life course perspectives. \n\tThe aims of this dissertation research included: 1) examining the relationship between state of marital dissolution and diabetes, how correlates of diabetes vary by state of dissolution, and whether there are differences by gender; 2) exploring how diabetes management differs by state of marital dissolution and gender; 3) determining whether aspects of marital history are associated with diabetes management; and 4) identifying marriage-related, potentially modifiable factors associated with diabetes management for each state of dissolution-gender category in adults over age 50 living with diabetes. These aims were met by analyzing cross-sectional data that were pooled from the 2010 and 2012 waves of the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study from participants who were eligible for and participated in the Enhanced-Face-to-Face and blood-based biomarker components. All analyses were weighted to account for the complex design of the survey. Sequential, binary logistic regression was used to examine odds of diabetes, and sequential OLS regression was used to understand diabetes management, as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). \n\tDiabetes prevalence was significantly higher in those who were widowed, compared to those who were married or divorced, and in men, compared to women. The literature suggested that divorced women may be particularly \u201cat risk\u201d; and they did, in fact, tend to have fewer social and financial resources and poorer health behaviors, compared to widowed and married women. However, these differences did not translate into higher odds of diabetes in divorced women. There were fewer consistent patterns in the characteristics of men, compared by state of dissolution. Those who were widowed did have higher odds of diabetes, compared to those who were married, but only before controlling for ascribed factors such as age and race/ethnicity. \n\tDiabetes management was not significantly associated with state of dissolution, nor were there differences by gender. However, there were differences in the theoretically-based risk and protection factors associated with HbA1c by state of dissolution and gender. Length of longest marriage served as a proxy for protection and was associated with lower HbA1c in men. Marital transitions (dissolutions and marriages) served as a proxy for crisis and provided more support for the selection of healthier women into and out of marriages than for crisis. Modifiable factors tended to be associated with HbA1c, with some variation by state of dissolution and gender. However, these relationships, like the relationships between state of dissolution and diabetes and HbA1c, tended to be attenuated by ascribed factors. These findings highlight the importance of social position, beyond state of dissolution, for understanding diabetes prevalence and management.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13977], "author_name_tesi": "LaCoe-Maniaci, Cynthia Lorraine", "last_name_ssi": "LaCoe-Maniaci", "middle_name_ssi": "Lorraine", "first_name_ssi": "Cynthia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Linda A.

Although previous studies have examined how arts integration is implemented in schools and how it affects student achievement, particularly standardized test scores, little qualitative research has focused on the lived practices of teachers working with arts integration and how such approaches are envisioned in schools. This study is unique as it concentrates on how elementary teachers\u2019 experiences, access to, and understandings of policy strongly affect how arts integration is organized, implemented, and measured. \n\tThis study investigates why the arts are used primarily as decoration for the classroom, and when arts integration projects are planned, implemented, and assessed, the arts component is frequently diluted and deemphasized. Teachers continue to use the arts even though they have lofty expectations placed on them, especially in regard to pressures of teaching the prescribed school district curriculum document and working within the confines of the mandated state tests. This dissertation theorizes how misunderstandings of arts integration are perpetuated over time, and how these misunderstandings lead to un/certainty. Adopting a more felt approach to teacher education may help construct curricula that takes into account the ambiguity and un/certainty of teaching, the necessity of risk taking, and embraces arts integration in teaching and learning. \n\tThe research study includes a textual analysis of written documentation on arts integration at a national, state, and local level and qualitative research in the field. Classroom observation, focus groups sessions, and teacher interviews regarding beliefs, practices, and training were conducted in order to understand the relationship between theory and practice. Furthermore, narratives are woven throughout the dissertation to highlight the voices of the researcher and elementary teachers. In the gaps between policy, beliefs and practice, generative discussions and curricular possibilities will be revealed that will impact arts integration, elementary education, and teacher education. Thus, this study presents an understanding of the un/certain space of dis/connect between official policy and live(d) teacher practice, and emphasizes the necessity of building a bridge between the two spheres.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3793], "author_name_tesi": "LaJevic, Lisa M", "last_name_ssi": "LaJevic", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Stephanie Springgay", "Stephanie Springgay", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Christine Marme Thompson", "John Daniel Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Stephanie Springgay, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephanie Springgay, Committee Chair", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Chair", "Christine Marme Thompson, Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["elementary education", "arts integration", "art education", "teacher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Visible Light Active, Nano-Architectured Metal Oxide Photo-Catalysts for Solar Fuel Applications\n", "id": "12287", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6191", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Large-scale implementation of renewable energy sources such as solar requires the development of an efficient energy capture, conversion and storage scheme.  Harnessing solar energy to create storable fuels, i.e., solar fuels, provides a unique strategy to meet this objective.  In this regard, hydrogen generation through water photoelectrolysis and methane generation via the photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide and water vapor are investigated.  The primary motivation of this work lies in the development of efficient, low cost materials for solar fuel applications.  \n\nMetal oxide semiconductors such as n-type titanium dioxide (TiO2) have generated significant interest in the scientific community due to their low cost, stability and high photocatalytic activity under band gap illumination.  The implementation of nano-structured materials has significantly enhanced the conversion efficiency obtained with TiO2 in applications such as water photoelectrolysis.  Despite these advancements, TiO2 has an inherently poor photo-response due its wide band gap (3.0-3.2 eV), which accounts for &#8776; 5% of the solar spectrum energy.  Therefore, the primary objective of this work is to develop materials with a photocatalytic activity approaching that of TiO2, while shifting the photo-response to harness the visible light portion of the solar spectrum.  Two differing approaches are evaluated in this work to meet this objective.\n\nHematite (&#945;-Fe2O3) has a band gap &#8776; 2.2 eV, well suited for capturing solar energy, but suffers from intrinsically poor electrical characteristics.  To overcome these limitations, iron oxide nanotubes were developed using a temperature controlled anodization technique.  This provides greater control over the film morphology to create high aspect ratio nano-structures approximately 1-4 \u00b5m in length, sufficient to harness solar energy, with a wall thickness approaching 10 nm to improve the electrical characteristics for photocatalytic application.  The performance of hematite nanotubes, formed after thermal annealing, were characterized using incident photon conversion efficiency measurements (IPCE).  A maximum IPCE of 3.5% was obtained under partial bias conditions, with a photo-response extending to &#8776; 600 nm.  \n\nAlternatively, modification of a nano-structured material with an intrinsically poor photoresponse was evaluated.  Amorphous tantalum oxide nanotubes were synthesized using an anodization technique, providing great control over the film morphology.  Nanotubes of varying film thickness in the range of 240 nm \u2013 15 \u00b5m, and wall thickness as small as 7 nm were obtained.  Subsequent crystallization and nitridation through thermal annealing in ammonia ambient was evaluated to create tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) nanotubes.  Tantalum nitride has a band gap &#8776; 2.1 eV, similar to that of hematite.  Water photoelectrolysis performance was evaluated and a maximum IPCE of 5.3% was obtained under partial bias conditions, with a red shift in the photoresponse of &#8776; 300 nm towards the visible relative to Ta2O5 nanotubes.\n\nFinally, the photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide and water vapor into hydrocarbons such as methane was evaluated for TiO2, &#945;-Fe2O3 and Ta3N5 nanotube arrays.  A microwave assisted, solvothermal approach to load platinum nanoparticle catalysts within the nanotube structure is evaluated.  Catalyst sensitization is necessary to achieve measurable yields for carbon dioxide reduction, and the composite nanotube photocatalysts were evaluated under simulated solar AM 1.5G conditions.  Methane generation is achieved for TiO2 and Ta3N5 composite photocatalysts at the rate of 25 ppm / cm2-hr and 9 ppm / cm2-hr, respectively.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6184], "author_name_tesi": "LaTempa, Thomas Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "LaTempa", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Qiming Zhang", "Wayne Roger Curtis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["solar fuel", "photo-catalyst", "nano-structure", "anodization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Utilizing Alternative Fuels", "id": "13849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7127", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a summary of four solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) research projects which addressed a number of SOFC technologies to use alternative fuels (other than H2, natural gas, and CO) and culminated in the development of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) anode design that is shown to generate electrical power by the oxidation of solid hydrocarbon fuel (coal) without external reformation. \n\tChapters 1 and 2, demonstrate the current state and limitations of SOFC operation on alternative hydrocarbon fuel sources. A common limitation in traditional SOFC systems is the inability to directly oxidize heavy liquid hydrocarbons due to carbon deposition coking or solid hydrocarbons due to fuel transport limitations. External reformation (Chapter 2) is oftenly used to overcome these limitations but at the cost system efficiency due to the chemical energy consumed in the reformation process.   \nThe contribution to the science and technology of electrochemistry presented here is the development of a liquid metal anode solid oxide fuel cell (LMA-SOFC) system capable of generating electrical power from the direct electrochemical oxidation of coal; as well as the development of a test system and protocol for the performance evaluation of new liquid metal or liquid alloy anode materials.

By making assumptions about the relevant physics of the problem, simplifications to the governing equations can be applied. These simplifications result in a reduced-order model that can significantly decrease the computational cost; however, the governing equations simplifications result in the reduced-order model neglecting to take into account all the physics of the system. Ideally, the neglected physics would have little to no impact on the dynamics of the system; however, this is not always the case for all input parameters. Therefore, it is important to determine the parameter space for which a reduced order model is valid. \n\nIn this thesis, numerical simulations of a slender cylinder in axial flow were performed using two different methods. The first is a strongly-coupled fluid-structure interaction simulation based on first-principles. First-principles for this case is solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid and the full equations of elasticity for the solid domain.

It consists of a single linear partial differential equation that requires significantly less computational resources to solve than the non-linear governing equations used in the first-principles model.

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can be used to produce electricity from organics, but they cannot treat the wastewater to levels needed to meet discharge limits while producing power. Anaerobic fluidized bed membrane bioreactors (AFMBRs) are an energy-efficient method for treating low strength wastewater, and thus they can be used to treat MFC effluent to meet discharge standards. Methanogenic microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) generate methane by fixing carbon dioxide. The purpose of these studies was to examine the effect of different acclimation methods on the performance and microbial communities of AFMBRs and MECs. \n\nDifferent AFMBR startup methods were compared to determine effect of startup on reactor performance, and to assess microbial communities in AFMBRs. Similar (t-test,\u03b1 = 0.05, P > 0.4) COD removal was achieved for diluted wastewater using AFMBRs acclimated to methanol (M), wastewater (W), or anaerobic digester sludge (D), with an average COD removal of 63 \u00b1 12%. Acclimation to acetate (A) significantly increased COD removal to 84 \u00b1 6%. Improved removal efficiency by acetate acclimation was also seen after exposing reactor M to acetate feed for a week. When reactor M was subsequently fed diluted wastewater, the COD removal increased to 70 \u00b1 6%. Microbial communities on the GAC were significantly different (P < 0.05) from those in the influent and reactor fluid, and were distinguished by greater abundances of Geobacter, sulfur-reducing bacteria, Syntrophaceae, and Chlorobiaceae. Reactor A demonstrated the highest relative abundance of Geobacter. These studies showed that acetate was a useful substrate for acclimation of AFMBR communities to achieve improved COD removal.\n\nThe cathode chamber of methanogenic MECs was inoculated with microbial communities pre-acclimated with GAC and chemical substrates to improve methane generation. Hydrogen-acclimated GAC had the highest relative abundance of Methanobacterium, which has been shown to dominate mixed-culture MEC archaeal communities. However, methane production from hydrogen-acclimated MECs was similar to communities acclimated to methanol and a VFA mix, which all averaged 23.5 \u00b1 9.7 nmol cm\u20133 d\u20131. Startup time was also insensitive to the substrate used in pre-acclimation. Pre-acclimation of communities with GAC promoted increased methane generation compared to MECs directly inoculated with GAC and an inoculum of bog sediment (12.7 \u00b1 4.1 nmol cm\u20133 d\u20131). Methane generation ceased after two cycles for MECs operated with bog sediment inoculum only. GAC could be a good growth support for enriching microbial communities associated with methanogenic MECs and exocellular electron transfer, as GAC communities had higher relative abundances of Methanobacterium, Geobacter, and sulfur-reducing bacteria which are known to be associated with microbial communities that develop in well-performing bioelectrochemical systems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11852], "author_name_tesi": "Labarge, Nicole Alyse", "last_name_ssi": "Labarge", "middle_name_ssi": "Alyse", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["AFMBR", "MEC", "wastewater treatment", "COD removal", "methane generation", "GAC", "activated carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The New Arecibo HF Interactions Facility Dual Array Cassegrain Antenna Design\n\n", "id": "9594", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3474", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new HF facility at Arecibo will replace prior facilities that are no longer in operation.

Microbial sulfur oxidation occurs in Frasassi as part of a larger sulfur cycle that, above the water table, stimulates cave formation through the production of sulfuric acid. Sulfur-oxidizing microbes commonly use either oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors. Metagenomic studies of Frasassi biofilms revealed that complete sulfur oxidation pathway and some nitrate reduction genes exist within the microbial community (Hamilton, et al 2015). There are two known dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways: denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA). In Frasassi, H2S (100-800 \u03bcM) and S\u00ba (20-80% dry mass of biofilms) are available in high concentrations, whereas oxygen (< 2-60 uM) and nitrate (< 0.06 \u03bcM) concentrations are much lower. Therefore we expect to find evidence of DNRA as an active nitrate reduction pathway, following the equation: \nH+ + H2O + NO3- + HS- \u2192 NH4+ +SO42-\t       \t\t\t\u0394G\u00b0= -448 kJ/molrxn    \nSulfur oxidation would drive the need for nitrate and create large amounts of energy, possibly explaining why nitrate is generally found below detection limit. Using previously binned metagenomic data from Frasassi biofilm sample PC08-64, I searched for homology with functional genes related to sulfur and nitrogen cycling. Genes necessary for DNRA are present in Bin 14, which is almost complete based on the presence of a full complement of amino acid tRNA synthetase genes. Bin 14 also contained a 16S rRNA gene that was closely related to Metallibacterium of the Xanthomonadaceae family. This genus has not been investigated at Frasassi before. Although previous FISH surveys have not detected large unidentified populations, the presence of a complete or nearly complete Metallibacterium genome bin suggests that it is abundant, a hypothesis that could be tested in future work using FISH and by further analyzing EMIRGE reconstructed 16S rRNA data.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14546], "author_name_tesi": "Labrado, Amanda Leane", "last_name_ssi": "Labrado", "middle_name_ssi": "Leane", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Jennifer Macalady ", "Dr. Katherine Freeman ", "Dr. Christopher House "], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Jennifer Macalady , Thesis Advisor", "Dr. Katherine Freeman , Committee Member", "Dr. Christopher House , Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Metagenomics", "Elemental sulfur", "Biofilms"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Productivity of Forage Cultivars of Chicory and Plantain in the Northeast Region of the United States.", "id": "5963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4092", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Summer growth of cool season species in the Northeast USA is reduced due to a combination of high temperature and drought. This reduce growth generates an imbalance in the offer of forage, and the use of alternative species is presented as a solution. The objectives of these studies were to evaluate forage cultivars of chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) and plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) for their annual as well as seasonal productivity and nutritive value when grown in the NE USA, and to evaluate physiological and morphological responses when subjected to water shortage or elevated temperatures. A first grazing experiment was carried out in 1998 evaluating several chicory and plantain cultivars. Chicory cultivars (Forage Feast, L.E. Lacerta, Grasslands Puna), plantain cultivars (Grasslands Lancelot and Ceres Tonic) and Pennlate orchardgrass were subjected to a combination of frequency (three or five-week rest period) and intensity (50 or 150-mm stubble height) of grazing. Puna chicory and Lancelot plantain had similar dry matter (DM) yields to Pennlate orchardgrass over spring (6511, 7357 and 7240 kg ha-1, respectively), whereas over the summer Puna chicory and Ceres Tonic plantain equaled the yield of Pennlate (3354, 3168, 3888 kg ha-1, respectively). Frequently grazed plots produced less DM during the summer than infrequently grazed plots (1669 vs. 4448 kg ha-1, p<0.001). However, herbage from frequently grazed plots exhibited higher crude protein (CP, 225 g kg-1) and in vitro true dry matter digestibility (IVTDMD, 890 g kg-1) but similar neutral detergent (NDF, 348 g kg-1) concentration than infrequently grazed plots (CP= 189 g kg-1, IVTDMD= 855 g kg-1, NDF= 374 g kg-1). In 2000 and 2001, Puna chicory, Lancelot plantain and Pennlate orchardgrass were tested when subjected to a variable frequency of grazing during the summer. Spring yields of Puna chicory were higher than those of Pennlate orchardgrass (5740 vs. 3610 kg ha-1 -average over year-, respectively, p<0.05), whereas summer DM yield of Puna chicory was either higher (5362 vs. 2893 kg ha-1 for Puna chicory and Pennlate orchardgrass in 2000, respectively, P<0.05) or similar (3368 and 3605 kg ha-1 Puna chicory and Pennlate orchardgrass in 2001, respectively). Yield of Lancelot plantain decreased greatly from 2000 to 2001 as a consequence of low plant survival, which was 25 percent of the initial stand by the end of the study.  During the springs of 2000 and 2001, the CP concentration of Puna chicory, Lancelot plantain and Pennlate orchardgrass were similar (174, 161 and 165 g kg-1, respectively), whereas during the summers Puna chicory CP concentration was higher than that of Pennlate orchardgrass and Lancelot plantain (199, 179 and 168 g kg-1, respectively, P<0.05). The NDF concentration of the forbs was lower than that of orchardgrass during spring (379 vs. 484 g kg-1, respectively, P<0.001) and summer (338 vs. 497 g kg-1, respectively, P<0.001). The IVTDMD of Puna chicory over the spring (872 g kg-1) was similar to that of orchardgrass (864 g kg-1), but higher than Lancelot plantain (740 g kg-1). Over the summer Puna chicory had the highest digestibility (899 g kg-1). The composition of the herbage of the three species differed significantly between seasons and among cultivars. Puna chicory had lower leaf to stem ratios than Pennlate orchardgrass during both seasons; nevertheless, Puna chicory IVTDMD was higher than that of orchardgrass. Nutritive value of Lancelot plantain was similar or slightly lower than that of Pennlate orchardgrass. Their herbage composition however, differed significantly.\nThe summer growth of cool season forages is reduced due to a combination of high temperatures and water shortage. A two year experiment was designed to compare the effect of two soil water availability conditions. Well-watered plots received water every week to maintain soil at or close to field capacity, while stressed plots received water every 3 wk in 2000 and 5 wk in 2001 near State College, PA. All plots were mowed at the beginning of the drying cycle. Puna chicory dry matter (DM) yield was not affected by the watering treatment applied in 2000 or 2001. Even though water stressed plants had a significantly lower leaf area index (LAI, 4.2 vs. 2.7 and 3.1 vs. 2.5 on watered and stressed plots in 2000 and 2001, respectively, P<0.05), it did not affect dry matter accumulation, and a slightly lower specific leaf area (SLA, 33.8 vs. 30.0 m2 kg-1 and 24.5 vs. 21.9 m2 kg-1 watered and stressed plots in 2000 and 2001, respectively) may have compensated to maintain yield. Water stress did not affect physiological functions. Average photosynthesis rates during 2000 and 2001 were close to 12 \u00ecmol CO2 m-2 s-1. The effect of water treatment on DM yield of Lancelot plantain was masked by low plant survival during 2000. \nWith the objective of quantifying morphogenetic and physiological traits of chicory (Grasslands Puna and Forage Feast) and plantain cultivars (Grasslands Lancelot and Ceres Tonic) when subjected to elevated day temperatures, a controlled environment study was carried out. Plants were grown in PVC pipes over 7 wk (2 + 5 wk acclimation and experimental period, respectively) in growth chambers set to either 25/15\u00b0C or 30/20\u00b0C day/night temperatures. Eight plants per species were harvested each week and separated into shoot and root components. Single leaf gas exchange was measured on 10 plants per species at 2 wk and 5 wk. Dry matter (DM) allocation between root and shoot of chicory and plantain (RSMR: root to shoot mass ratio) differed between species at 4 wk (0.52 vs. 0.27 for chicory and plantain, respectively, P<0.01), when chicory plants had a larger amount of DM allocated to the primary root than plantain (0.3 vs. 0.2 g in 3 wk, respectively, P<0.1). Both species produced similar amounts of shoot DM at each harvest but it was allocated to different structures. At 5 wk, chicory had allocated 5.3 g to the a main axis and 2 g to daughter rosettes, while plantain had allocated 1.9 g to the axis and 5.3 g to daughter rosettes (P<0.001 and P<0.01 for main axis and tiller comparison respectively).  Neither the morphological nor the physiological aspects evaluated for chicory and plantain were affected by temperature. Single leaf photosynthesis at 5 wk was higher on plantain than on chicory (13.3 and 17 \u00ecmol CO2 m-2 s-1, respectively, P<0.01). \nThese studies demonstrated that Puna chicory can produce annual and seasonal yields similar to or greater than those of orchardgrass making it a viable alternative forage species for the Northeast US. Puna chicory can withstand relatively long periods without rainfall and its use in pastures of the NE USA could be beneficial. Both chicory and plantain did not exhibit signs of reduced shoot or root growth rates due to high temperatures and any morphological or physiological difference between species did not however, confer an advantage or disadvantage when grown in temperatures above optimum. However, the low winter survival of plantain limits its potential use as a forage species in the region.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4070], "author_name_tesi": "Labreveux, Maria Eugenia", "last_name_ssi": "Labreveux", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugenia", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Brian Beegle", "Marvin H Hall", "Robert Howard Skinner", "Matt A Sanderson", "Gabriella Anne Varga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Brian Beegle, Committee Member", "Marvin H Hall, Committee Chair", "Robert Howard Skinner, Committee Member", "Matt A Sanderson, Committee Chair", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["summer stress", "rainout shelters", "grazing", "water deficit"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "What factors contribute to individuals perceiving technologies as essential?

During this process, hydrogen can enter the zirconium-alloy of the fuel cladding, and under proper conditions, precipitate as brittle hydride platelets which can severely impact cladding ductility and fracture toughness. Hydrogen tends to migrate to and precipitate at colder spots. Because high local hydride concentrations increase the risk of cladding failure, it is important to predict the local hydrogen distribution. \nHydrogen transport depends on different phenomena. Even though migration can only occur when the hydrogen is in solid solution, the cladding temperatures during operating condition allow a portion of the hydrogen to be in solid solution. Therefore, as hydrogen is picked up during the corrosion reaction between the cladding and the coolant, it can migrate following Fick\u2019s law and the Soret effect. Once the local hydrogen content reaches the terminal solid solubility for precipitation, the hydrogen will start precipitating as zirconium hydride. Previous work in our laboratory implemented a model that describes these different phenomena, into the 3D fuel performance code BISON. \nA first attempt to benchmark this model has been made in this study by comparing the results given by BISON to the hydrogen distribution measured in a nuclear fuel rod, which underwent a five cycle exposure at the Gravelines nuclear power plant. This was feasible because of the very detailed information about that reactor and fuel pin were available from the thesis of J.-H. Zhang in 1992. The benchmark performed with BISON showed very good agreement between the calculations experimental observation.\nThe calculation above used a value of the precipitation kinetics parameter \u03b12 based on a fit that ignored discrepancies in the early part of the precipitation process. The calculation was revised according to a new model.

Conventional polymer electrolytes have higher energy densities and are safer than traditional lead-acid battery systems, but still have issues with solvent leaking and low transference numbers due to the ability of both the cation and the anion of the salt to move.  In single-ion conducting polymers, or ionomers, one of the ions is covalently attached to the polymer backbone, eliminating any diffusive motion from this ion and providing for a transference number approaching unity for the non-bound ion.  With the choice of an appropriate polymer, the diffusing ion is dissolved within the polymer matrix, eliminating the need for solvent and mitigating the issue of solvent leakage.  However, one of the main limitations with ionomer systems is their typically low conductivity at room temperature (a desired operating range for many applications).  The work in this dissertation elucidates the mechanisms by which ions move throughout ionomer systems and contribute to conductivity, an important step toward a predictive understanding of these systems.  Ultimately, this understanding is critical for creating more efficient ionomer electrolyte systems for battery applications.\n   Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool to study the motion and dynamics of ionomer systems because this technique provides structural information and is able to elucidate the movement of species (charged and uncharged) in the system, where dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) can only measure the movement of charged species.  Moreover, NMR and DRS studies are conducted with the ionomer systems in their natural state, in the absence of solvent, providing insight into how the ionomer systems would behave if they were to be used inside a battery system.  Comparisons to DRS measurements are important to discern the contributions of all parts of the ionomer system to the overall motion and dynamics.\n   The motion of the diffusing ion through the polymer matrix, as well as the polymer matrix itself, in two ionomer systems was studied to understand how the motion of the diffusing ion relates to the structure and dynamics of the polymer matrix and ultimately determines conduction.  The first system consists of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-based sulfonate ionomer with lithium as the diffusing anion.  Within this ionomer system two sample series were studied: one with varying fraction of the ionized unit and constant spacer molecular weight, and the other with a constant fraction of the ionized unit and varying molecular weight of the PEO spacer.  7Li and 1H T1 inversion recovery experiments and motional narrowing of the spectral linewidths for the two PEO-based ionomer series were studied as well as 7Li pulsed field gradient stimulated echo (PGSE) NMR to determine the extent and mechanism of motion within these ionomers on length scales of nanometers and micrometers, respectively.  Motional narrowing of the 7Li linewidths indicates that as the ion content is decreased the lithium ions become more mobile.  The local motions of the lithium ions are correlated to the polymer segmental motion, although the motion of the lithium ions is approximately an order of magnitude slower than the polymer segmental motion.  Comparison between 7Li PGSE self-diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity and lithium self-diffusion coefficients calculated from the ionic conductivity by the Nernst-Einstein equation indicated that the self-diffusion coefficient decreased with increasing ion content due to the presence of ionic aggregates with the exception of the PEO400-100%Li ionomer, which exhibited the greatest self-diffusion coefficient even with the highest ion content.  The anomalous behavior of the PEO400-100%Li ionomer was determined to be due to the decreased ion-polymer interaction that results in a mechanism that cannot be described by a simple succession of ion hops or by the complete motion of the polymer backbone.  It was concluded that greater changes in the self-diffusion coefficients can be obtained by changing the length of the PEO spacer rather than by changing the fraction of the ionized unit in order to achieve a certain ion content.  Battery systems depend on the diffusion of ions between electrodes to maintain charge balance and as such an electrolyte system that exhibits increased ion diffusion coefficients may lead to a more efficient battery.\n   The second system studied here consists of a polysiloxane backbone with pendent PEO and phosphonium side chains.  The length of the PEO side chain was kept constant at three oligomeric units to aid in solvation of the counter anions.  The identities and amounts of the counter anion were varied to be either a fluoride or a TFSI anion with concentrations between 5-26 mol %.  Polymer and anion motion were investigated through 31P and 19F T1 relaxation rate measurements and motional linewidth analysis, as well as 19F PGSE NMR over a temperature range of 293-407 K.  Comparison of results obtained from NMR spectroscopy and DRS showed that the self-diffusion coefficient is dominated by the motion of the anion with very little interaction with the polymer backbone.

However, the medical usage of cannabinoids is limited due to the development of tolerance whereby more drug is needed to achieve the same therapeutic outcome and dependence which may play a role in addiction. While previous research in the Morgan laboratory has demonstrated that mice expressing a desensitization-resistant form of the CB1 receptor (S426A/S430A) develop tolerance in a sex- and agonist-specific manner in an acute model of thermal pain, these effects have yet to be examined in a more clinically relevant model of inflammatory pain. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine whether the S426A/S430A mutation altered tolerance to either the full cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 or the partial cannabinoid agonist \u22069-THC and whether these effects differed in a sex-specific manner. Tolerance to CP55,940 and \u22069-THC was assessed using the formalin model. In this model, intraplantar injection of 2.5% formalin into the hindpaw results in a biphasic pain response comprised of a rapid acute phase (0-15min) followed by a prolonged inflammatory phase (15-60min) during which pain behaviors are quantified. Dose response curves for each drug (0-0.2 mg/kg CP55,940; 0-6 mg/kg \u22069-THC) were generated for male and female S426A/S430A mutant and wild-type mice. Male wild-type mice were more sensitive to the antinociceptive effects of both CP55,940 and \u22069-THC compared to female wild-type mice. Cannabinoid tolerance was assessed following daily administration of either 6 mg/kg of \u22069-THC (14 days) or 0.1 mg/kg of CP55,940 (28 days). Following 14 days of treatment with 6 mg/kg of \u22069-THC, male wild-type mice developed tolerance to 6 mg/kg \u22069-THC while male mutants and female mice of either genotype did not. Following chronic dosing with CP55,940, wild-type males were tolerant by day 21 whereas mutants were not tolerant by day 28. Males were more sensitive to the effects of 0.1 mg/kg CP55,940 as this dose failed to produce significant antinociception in females. Taken together, these results suggest that female mice are less sensitive to the antinociceptive effects of both \u22069-THC and CP55,940 and that the S426A/S430A mutation delays tolerance development to both \u22069-THC and CP55,940 in this inflammatory pain model. Additionally, male wild-type mice became tolerant to \u22069-THC more quickly than female wild-type mice, raising the possibility that the mechanisms of tolerance may be partially sex-specific.

In energy-limited systems, warming temperatures may lengthen growing season and increase water demand.  In water-limited systems, increased evapotranspiration associated with warmer temperatures may limit species diversity and productivity.  Management may help maintain productivity under changing climate by reducing competition for resources, increasing heterogeneity, and decreasing disturbance risk.  I sought to quantify how projected changes in climate may alter the composition and productivity of Puget Lowland forests, and how management could mitigate changes.  I also sought to determine the effects of management on, and carbon tradeoffs of, restoring oak woodland habitats.  I used a simulation approach to model four landscape-scale treatments (control, burn only, thin only, thin and burn) using current climate and projected climate for two general circulation models (CCSM 4 and CNRM-CM5), driven by two emission scenarios (moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) emissions) at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.  At the landscape-scale, I found little difference in carbon dynamics and species composition under the moderate emission scenarios.  However, by late-century under the high emission scenario, I found substantial declines in productivity due to a decrease in late-successional species growth.  The major effect of management was to increase net ecosystem carbon balance after 2030, relative to the control.  Relative to 2012, I found the frequency of sites that were likely to contain Oregon white oak decreased over time under all treatments, regardless of climate.  To counteract the decline, I added an intensively managed 708 ha oak restoration area (2% of the landscape) to the landscape-scale thin and burn treatment.  Relative to the thin and burn treatment, the intensive management increased oak presence and incurred small initial carbon costs (<400 g C m-2) that decreased over time.  My research suggests that under the late-century high emission scenario, management cannot alter the climate-driven decline of late-successional species, but intensive management can alter forest structure, which may increase species richness and help alleviate declines in productivity.

The ability to sense in particular represents both the unique opportunity and the unique challenge of our time. It is an opportunity because through the acquired data, it is possible to glean insight into processes that are still too complex to be modeled correctly, and a challenge because the sheer volume of data generated is often overwhelming.\n\nParadoxically, despite having the capability to collect vast stores of data, we still lack knowledge of how to best analyze and use this data. In fact, multiple review papers have demonstrated that published methods are too application specific and depend too strongly on the data set size to be deployed on the scale necessary to address the problem. Heated debates rage in the scientific literature on how to best reduce the data into meaningful features and how to apply this reduced data to solve real-world problems. \n\nThis thesis proposes a novel approach to reducing the dimension of data into meaningful features that preserve the information of the data, but also enable the localization of a small, newly collected, set of data in a previously stored data set. The process of identifying a location within a stored data set is termed in-sequence localization and it is particularly important in applications such as vehicle localization, economic forecasting, energy generation mode selection, and stream health monitoring, where stored data can be used to infer the present and future state of a process. \n\nTo enable the process of in-sequence localization, this thesis proposes to model the data using autoregressive models, such that a small number of model coefficients can be used to represent large subsets of data. Then using these autoregressive models, in-sequence localization is performed by comparing new data with the models and determining model feasibility. Emphasizing the fact that this method is to be used on practical data, the models are determined such that in-sequence localization is robust to the data collection noise typically observed in sensors. \n\nThis thesis is developed around the application of vehicle localization. This motivating application arises from the need to augment position estimates of the Global Positioning System in the event of emergencies or signal occlusions. We return repeatedly to this application because of its intuitive nature when conveying concepts throughout the thesis. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the methods, data from the applications of economic forecasting, energy generation mode selection, stream health monitoring, and random data is used to demonstrate algorithms throughout the text.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10131], "author_name_tesi": "Laftchiev, Emil Ivanov", "last_name_ssi": "Laftchiev", "middle_name_ssi": "Ivanov", "first_name_ssi": "Emil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Sean Brennan", "Minghui Zhu", "John F Doherty", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Dissertation Advisor", "Sean Brennan, Dissertation Advisor", "Minghui Zhu, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data Dimension Reduction", "Stochastic Programming", "Multi-dimensional Data Representation", "In-Sequence Localization"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "BinDNN: Resilient Function Matching Using Deep Learning", "id": "12477njl5114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Determining if two functions taken from different compiled binaries originate from the same function in the source code has many applications to malware reverse engineering.

The AHR was originally identified based on its ability to bind to environmental contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) or halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAH). Persistant ligand-mediated AHR activation has shown toxic effects via binding of AHR to the dioxin response elements (DREs) present in the promoters of various functionally diverse target genes, including genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism (eg. CYP1A1). Evolutionary conservation of the receptor insinuates its role beyond toxicity. Epidemiological studies have identified a positive correlation between exposure to environmental contaminants and/ or tobacco smoking (rich sources of AHR agonists) and aggressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, which is prevalent in females. It is the leading musculo-skeletal disorder, affecting more than 1% of the world\u2019s population. RA commonly affects the articular joints of the hands and feet leading to systemic joint inflammation. Under the inflammatory milieu in the RA-synovium, resident fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) undergo hyperplasia, a hallmark event in RA. Sustained joint inflammation and further activation of FLS leads to joint destruction. The studies presented here build upon our previously published data in cancer cell lines suggesting activation of AHR can induce expression of pro-inflammatory genes, and several growth factors that are critical in cellular hyperplasia. We have also characterized the instrumental role of AHR in migratory and invasive phenotypes. Since higher levels of AHR protein have been observed in synovial tissues from RA patients, and the phenotype of RA-FLS is reminiscent to that of metastatic cancer cells; we hypothesized that antagonism of AHR by the potent AHR antagonist GNF351 could mitigate cytokine-induced expression of pro-inflammatory genes and growth factors. We also wished to study the role of AHR in primary RA-FLS proliferation, migration, and RA-FLS-mediated protease-dependent matrix degradation. \n\tMicroarray analysis on RA-FLS exposed to proinflammatory interleukin 1B (IL1B) suggests the involvement of genes in multiple pathways responsible for RA pathogenesis. Based on the microarray data, certain cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that possess DREs in their promoter regions were picked using SCOPE v 2.1.0. Subsequent analysis of mRNA levels suggests AHR antagonist GNF351 can significantly repress such proinflammatory mediators as IL1B, IL6, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), C-C chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, epiregulin (EREG), amphiregulin (AREG) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. We further identified that the suppressive effects of GNF351 were AHR-dependent. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) behind GNF351-mediated mitigation, we performed promoter analysis and chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Our mechanistic data demonstrate that the occupancy of AHR on the promoters of IL1B, VEGF-A, EREG and AREG facilitates cytokine-mediated induction of these genes. AHR antagonist GNF351 treatment can inhibit AHR translocation into the nucleus and thus prevent promoter occupancy by the AHR/ARNT heterodimer and thus attenuating the cytokine-mediated gene transcription. \n\tDue to enhanced levels of proinflammatory mediators and growth factors, FLS in RA-synovium can undergo transformation resulting in FLS-hyperplasia and pannus formation. GNF351 suppressed cytokine-induced RA-FLS hyperplasia. Once activated, these FLS become highly invasive and migratory, and the AHR plays a critical role in such phenotypes. GNF351 not only inhibited migration of RA-FLS but also suppressed mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and 9) and gelatin matrix degradation. Numerous attempts have been made in RA research to block these aforementioned pathways individually with limited success. However, a suppressive effect of GNF351 on all these pathways collectively reveals that targeting the AHR is a viable combinatorial therapeutic strategy for the amelioration of RA.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9904], "author_name_tesi": "Lahoti, Tejas Suresh", "last_name_ssi": "Lahoti", "middle_name_ssi": "Suresh", "first_name_ssi": "Tejas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew", "Christopher Albert Mullin", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Andrew David Patterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Albert Mullin, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Andrew David Patterson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ah receptor", "GNF351", "AHR antagonism", "rheumatoid arthritis", "fibroblast-like synoviocytes", "HFLS-RA"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THROUGH WALL SURVEILLANCE USING ULTRAWIDEBAND RANDOM\nNOISE RADAR\n", "id": "7871", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1176", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent terrorist activities and law-enforcement situations involving hostage\nsituations underscore the need for effective through-wall detection.

A coherent polarimetric random noise\nradar architecture has been developed based on ultrawideband (UWB) technology and\nsoftware defined radio, which has great promise in its ability to covertly detect obscured\ntargets. The main advantages of the random noise radar lie in two aspects: first, random\nnoise waveform has an ideal \u00a1\u00a7thumbtack\u00a1\u00a8 ambiguity function, i.e., its down range and\ncross range resolution can be separately controlled, thus providing unambiguous high\nresolution imaging at any distance; second, random noise waveform is inherently low\nprobability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD), i.e., it is immune\nfrom detection, jamming, and interference. Thus, it is an ideal candidate sensor for covert\nimaging of obscured regions in hostile environments.\nFor human activity characterization, different parts of the human body have\ndifferent movements when a person is performing different physical activities.

In the final stage, graphical user interfaces are created to facilitate users\u2019 access to these ANN models. Users can input the parameters and the results are displayed in the graphical user interface. The selected ranges of input data are also displayed at the end through a graphical user interface in order to enhance its usability.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12246], "author_name_tesi": "Lai, I-AN ", "last_name_ssi": "Lai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "I-AN", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "John Yilin Wang", "Eugene Morgan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "John Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Eugene Morgan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Artificial Neural Netwrok", "Waterflooding"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Thermal Biosensor Based Micromachined Y-cut Quartz\nresonators", "id": "19876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9523", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a high-sensitivity, calorimetric, point-of-care device for automated bedside urine testing based on a micromachined thermal sensor is presented.

Poon et al. demonstrated that when GhPLA1 was added to tissue culture media, it increased the production of embryogenic calli by 2.68 fold compared to non-protein treated controls. These results inspired this thesis research to develop PLA protein as a potential purified tissue culture additive and to characterize its function of SE enhancement in the recalcitrant Theobroma cacao tissue culture system. Two PLA orthologs were identified from the Theobroma cacao genome based on 1) gene homology and 2) microarray expression data (TcPLA1 and TcPLA3). These two genes were cloned into pET14b, an Escherichia coli protein expression vector. TcPLA1 and TcPLA3 proteins were expressed from E. coli and isolated using Ni-Resin HIS-tag purification. GhPLA1 in addition to TcPLA1 and TcPLA3 proteins were applied to T. cacao tissue culture system via a protein solution drip method described in detail in Chapter 5. Specifically, the goal of this thesis was to evaluate the function of PLA proteins in T. cacao via 1) observed effects on embryo production and 2) effects of protein treatment on SE transcription factor genes such as BBM, LEC1, LEC2, AGL15, and FUS3. Embryo production was observed after 2 months of protein treatment. SE gene expression was observed via RT-qPCR. Results show GhPLA1 protein treatment increased embryo production and enhanced SE gene expression of transcription factor AGL15. Understanding how PLA interacts with SE genes can give insight into the complex orchestration of gene expression during plant embryo development. There were many challenges in completing this thesis work and unfortunately there was not enough time to thoroughly evaluate TcPLA1 and TcPLA3 protein treatment. Although, preliminary results of TcPLA1 and TcPLA3 protein treatment in T. cacao tissue culture are promising.

Previous studies have reported the effectiveness of certain instructional strategies in supporting reflection, such as classroom discussions with instructor and peers (e.g., Van Zeen, 1997), learning journals (e.g., Jarvis, 2001; Moon, 1999), concept mapping (e.g., Fellows, 1994), and question prompts (Davis, 2000; 2003). These strategies support reflection through social interaction, thought articulation, engaging in retrospective review, and actively monitoring and evaluating the individual learning process.  \nWhile online asynchronous discussion has been used extensively in distance learning environments, educators have found that merely exposing students to reflective activity, such as through social peer discussion, does not necessarily mean that students will engage in higher-order thinking or reflect effectively. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of using two types of instructional strategies?peer discussion and learning journals?and combined them with question prompts to support reflection in an online learning environment. \nA factorial design was employed. A total of 277 college students were recruited from a Web-based introductory course on energy and environment. All students participated in two weekly discussions that required them to post either journal entries or peer discussion messages before, during, and after lessons. In addition, these two main strands--journal writing and peer discussion--were further subdivided so that some student groups in each were provided with question prompts related to the lessons, while other groups were not. Thus, there were four different treatments: Journal entries with question prompts; journal entries without question prompts; peer discussion with question prompts; and peer discussion without question prompts. The discourse transcripts and unit exam scores were collected to measure the level of reflection, breadth of discourse, length of discourse, and comprehension exam scores. The discourse transcripts were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. \nThe statistical results showed that students who wrote learning journals with question prompts had more keywords, longer messages, and better comprehension exam scores than students who wrote learning journals without question prompts. Also, students who wrote learning journals with question prompts had statistically significant higher reflection levels, more keywords, longer messages, and higher comprehension exam scores than students who had peer discussions with question prompts. A comparison of learning journals without question prompts and peer discussions without question prompts did not reveal significant findings, nor did a comparison of peer discussion without question prompts and peer discussion with question prompts. \nThe study also revealed that the nature of the tools, the nature of the learning tasks, and the guidance that the students received fostered reflection in the distance learning environment. Additionally, students?selective use of question prompts may also affect students?metacognition and reflection level.

The pedagogical framework, Systematic-Theoretical Instruction (STI), adopted in this study was proposed by Piotr Gal\u2019perin and originated from Vygotsky\u2019s sociocultural theory (SCT) of consciousness. The foundational principle of STI is that well-organized education can promote mental development if it provides learners with appropriate mediation in the form of concrete cognitive tools and step-by-step guidance.\nGiven its complexity the Chinese temporal-system was chosen as the unit of instruction. The figurative meaning and grammatical functions of Chinese temporal expressions and selected aspect markers (\u8457 zhe,\u4e86 le, and\u4e86\u2026\u4e86 le\u2026le)were presented in the form of visual schemata (SCOBAs) as a means for learners to regulate their mental actions during the learning process. The concept-based instruction not only provided learners with the meaning of the target grammatical unit, but also provided step-by-step guidance for learners to develop the target grammatical concept. \nThe teaching experiment spanned eight weeks. Statistical analyses of performance on written tasks (translation and essay) by three different groups of CFL learners were conducted. The experimental group and control group 1 were at the elementary level and were taught by the researcher of the present study. Control group 2 was at the intermediate level and taught by other instructors. Analyses revealed that the experimental group outperformed control group 1 and performed no differently (no statistical difference) from the more advanced control group 2.\nQualitative analyses were also carried out on the tasks completed by the experimental group. A questionnaire was also administered to the experimental group at the end of the instructional period in order to investigate learners\u2019 response to the innovative teaching approach and their learning progress. Qualitative analyses indicated that as the instructional program progressed, participants exhibited improvement in terms of efficiency, correctness and consistency of performance on the relevant tasks. \nThe findings suggest that a coherent and organized pedagogical presentation can enhance learners\u2019 development.  In addition, complicated grammatical concepts regarded more suitable for advanced learners can be taught to novice learners when the concepts are presented as meaningful units in a coherent and systematic way. This study also offers implications on current foreign language pedagogical practices, especially in the field of teaching Chinese as a foreign language, in terms of renovation of grammar instruction, development of teaching material, curriculum design and learner development. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7975], "author_name_tesi": "Lai, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Lai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Lantolf", "Karen E Johnson", "Xiaofei Lu", "Meredith Christine Doran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Lantolf, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Xiaofei Lu, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sociocultural theory", "concept-based approach", "teaching Chinese as a foreign language", "foreign language pedagogy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Planning For Sustainable Forest Restoration: The Case Study Of Hartley Wood In The Arboretum at Penn State", "id": "13968vtl106", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13968", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ecological restoration is an important process which landscape architects and planners may implement on a variety of sites. This is not only important to flora and fauna and the recovery of life-sustaining natural processes, but is a social good which can strongly connect communities to natural surroundings and to one another for generations. It is both science and art -- drawing on technical expertise as well as public consciousness and participation.\n\nCurrently, there is very little longitudinal reporting on the successes and failures in sustaining restorations of landscapes. While Landscape Performance is an emergent movement in design practice, it has not yet been able to formulate generalizable guidelines for long-term social and ecological sustainability of restoration projects. Currently, this is due to the focus on site scale design in Landscape Performance, as opposed to intervention in landscape system processes. An in-depth case study with common challenges of forest restoration could extract lessons in project planning for a variety of contexts.\n\nThe Arboretum at Penn State has for several years \u2013 and, for the last two, in earnest \u2013 taken on the restoration of native plant communities in Hartley Wood. This site consists of 40 acres of old growth oak-dominant forest, which developed a vigorous invasive shrub layer (a potential harbinger of ecosystem collapse) due to decades without comprehensive management. As part of the current effort in establishing a native wildflower trail in the woodlot, The Arboretum has embarked on a multi-year phased removal of invasive species and intensive re-introduction of natives previously documented on site. The intensity of this design\u2019s implementation on the landscape, however, garners a wide variety of responses from habitual trail visitors. The integration of ecologically effective measures with a nuanced approach to maintaining community cooperation will be critical to the project\u2019s long-term success.\n\nThis thesis conducts biophysical and social surveys and suggests analogous GIS and other digital analyses for use by landscape architects embarking on restoration projects. The biophysical survey is composed of botanical and soil studies. The botanical study maps the distribution of seventeen invasive species shared between Hartley Wood and the adjacent residential neighborhoods of College Heights and Overlook Heights. The soil study compares fungal populations in several habitats in and around Hartley Wood and points to salient factors in their restoration potential. The author offers GIS alternatives for these studies in design practice. The social survey finds statistically significant predictors of College Heights and Overlook Heights residents\u2019 willingness to remove invasive plants on their property. The author extracts lessons on content and methods for future surveys in restoration planning. Together, these approaches will allow The Arboretum and analogous restoration managers to prioritize workflows and outreach both on the site and beyond it. An examination of the process will lead to a better understanding of the process by which to integrate ecological restoration into landscape design and management practice. The ultimate aim is to contribute to the framing of ecological restoration and related decision-making within Landscape Architecture practice. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14114], "author_name_tesi": "Lakoba, Vasiliy T", "last_name_ssi": "Lakoba", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Vasiliy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mallika Bose", "Derrick Taff", "Ken Tamminga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mallika Bose, Thesis Advisor", "Derrick Taff, Committee Member", "Ken Tamminga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Landscape Architecture", "Planning", "Invasive plants", "Invasive species", "Forest Restoration", "Ecological Restoration"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "HYDROGEN PRODUCTION FROM CELLULOSE FERMENTATION END PRODUCTS USING MICROBIAL ELECTROLYSIS CELLS\n", "id": "8952", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1922", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dark fermentation of cellulose has been well studied as a bio-hydrogen production method but its drawbacks include a low hydrogen yield and the presence of fermentation end products in the effluent. Electrohydrogenesis is a new hydrogen production method where bacteria in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) oxidize an organic substrate at the anode producing electrons and protons which are combined at the cathode to produce hydrogen. This process has been used effectively with various substrates, including typical fermentation end products such as acetic and lactic acids. However, MECs have not been tested with mixtures of such substrates.\nIt is shown here that good hydrogen yields, high maximum production rates, and high overall energy efficiencies can be obtained with either synthetic or cellulosic material fermentation effluents. MEC performance was tested with either a non-acclimated inoculum or an inoculum pre-acclimated to individual substrates in a synthetic fermentation effluent. MEC tests were then conducted using a synthetic fermentation effluent, and actual cellobiose and corn stover fermentation effluents. Hydrogen yields were between 800 \u00b1 290 mL H2/g COD for reactors using non-acclimated inocula with the synthetic effluent, and 1000 \u00b1 300 mL H2/g COD for  reactors using acclimated inocula with the cellobiose effluent. The maximum hydrogen production rate ranged from 0.59 \u00b1 0.21 to 1.11 \u00b1 0.13 m3 H2/m3 reactor/d. Overall energy efficiencies decreased from 62 \u00b1 7% with a synthetic effluent in the acclimated reactors to 44 \u00b1 16% with a corn stover effluent. Pre-acclimation of the inoculum to the single substrates improved performance, and using a cellobiose fermentation effluent gave the most promising results among the actual fermentation effluents tested in this study. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1904], "author_name_tesi": "Lalaurette, Elodie ", "last_name_ssi": "Lalaurette", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Elodie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellulose fermentation end products", "microbial electroylsis cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Conceptions of Community During Amenity-Based Development: The case of Great Barrington, MA\n\n", "id": "8257", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4664", "abstract_tesi": "Bucolic landscapes, quaint towns, and affordable land have made many rural areas prime locations for amenity-based development.

Situating local discourses within these theoretical frameworks allows for a greater understanding of the conflicts that arise during town planning.

I argue that the tendency for peacebuilding programs in the region to focus primarily on protecting local women from the violent men in their domestic lives is part of complex geopolitical processes that reinforce gendered and racialized geographies of difference. This approach to peacebuilding isolates \u2018local\u2019 forms of violence rather than illuminating the ways in which the local exists in and through its connections with differently scaled processes including aggression perpetrated by the state, by international actors, and via the multiple violences of militarization and development. I contend that this narrative of \u2018local\u2019 violence promotes the scaled and gendered categories of protector, victim, and aggressor upon which to military and post-war development interventions are designed. In this dissertation, I examine the negotiations of these geographies of difference in people\u2019s everyday lives in northern Uganda to contest both the assumed violence of the local and the implied benevolence of those claiming the role of protector.\nEmpirically, this dissertation is based upon a year of ethnographic research in northern Uganda. Theoretically, it draws from and contributes to the literatures of feminist theories of war, critical development studies, and feminist postcolonial scholarship to answer the following questions: How do war narratives shape the development of post-war interventions? How are gender regimes implicated in promoting the narratives and practices of both war and peacebuilding? And what can an analysis of embodied experience tell us about how systems of violence transverse the war/post-war transition? Ultimately, this dissertation offers a feminist geopolitical analysis of the narrative of local violence and the protectorship triad by examining how identities are produced, politicized, and manipulated in relation to projects intended to bring peace and development to a particular region. By using the lens of everyday experiences, this dissertation contributes not only to the identification of the oppressive potential of the protectorship triad but also the opportunities it provides for alternative strategies to fight violence and oppression.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9037], "author_name_tesi": "Laliberte, Nicole ", "last_name_ssi": "Laliberte", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine Dowler", "Melissa Wright", "Brian King", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine Dowler, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Wright, Committee Member", "Brian King, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Feminist geopolitics", "Uganda", "Development", "War", "Gender", "Militarism"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Learning in context in a short-term education abroad program", "id": "9008", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3641", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to describe learning that occurred among participants who engaged in a short-term education abroad program using a modified situated learning theoretical framework.

In order to design an effective antimicrobial packaging system for commercial applications, it is important to study the impact of various factors that govern the structure and properties of calcium alginate films and the diffusion of nisin from these films. It is known that nisin is a cationic polypeptide, whereas alginate is an anionic polymer. Ionic interactions between nisin and alginate might hamper the release of nisin from the alginate matrix, leading to reduced antimicrobial activity. Hence, it is essential to characterize interactions between nisin and alginate and to investigate the antimicrobial activity of nisin released from calcium alginate films. The overall goal of this research was to study the mechanisms and kinetics of nisin release from calcium alginate films. The objectives were to: (a) modify agar diffusion assay for better quantification of nisin; (b) determine factors affecting the release of nisin from calcium alginate films; (c) investigate the interaction between nisin and alginate; (d) determine the kinetics of release; (e) evaluate the physical, mechanical and optical properties of these films; and (f) investigate antimicrobial activity of the released nisin. \n\tAgar diffusion bioassay, using Micrococcus luteus, is a commonly used method for quantification of nisin concentration. However, the correlation between inhibition zone and nisin concentration is not well established at higher nisin concentrations. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of different well size (small and large) and pre-diffusion times (0, 24, 48 and 72 h) at 4\u00b0C on the sensitivity, precision and accuracy of nisin quantification. Regression analysis indicate that small wells were better than large wells because of smaller standard deviation, higher predictive accuracy, and better discrimination between mean inhibition zones at neighboring nisin concentrations. Statistical analysis by Tukey\u2019s test showed that pre-diffusion resulted in significantly different inhibition zones at different nisin concentations. Pre-diffusion also improved sensitivity of the assay at different nisin concentrations. Different regression models were considered to explore the relationship between inhibition zone and nisin concentration for all pre-diffusion times. A spline model was the best fit model and 48 h was the best pre-diffusion time.  \n\tFactors affecting the release of nisin from calcium alginate films were studied by the disc agar diffusion bioassay. Calcium alginate films were formed by two methods \u2013 cross-linking before drying (CBD) and cross-linking after drying (CAD) \u2013 using various alginate compositions, cross-linking times and Ca2+concentrations. The method of film formation, cross-linking time, and Ca2+concentration had a significant effect (p<0.05) on nisin release. Alginate composition did not affect nisin release significantly (p>0.05). SEM images showed that film formation method influenced the microstructure of films considerably. Films made by the CBD method and cross-linked with high Ca2+ concentration had the highest nisin release.\n\tThe binding between nisin and alginate was investigated for various concentrations and compositions of sodium alginate and in the presence of Ca2+. Six concentrations of sodium alginate (1.67-33.33 mg/ml) were added to nisin solution (0.5 mg/ml) and the free nisin remaining was measured by HPLC. Results indicated that nisin binds with alginate, but this binding was reversible in the presence of Ca2+. The composition of alginate did not have a significant effect (p>0.05) on the nisin-sodium alginate binding. However, alginate with higher guluronic acid content binds less nisin in the presence of Ca2+. \n\tDiffusion of nisin from calcium alginate films cross-linked with various concentrations of Ca2+ (0.18-1.25 M) was investigated. The effect of cross-linking on the degree of swelling, mechanical properties, and optical properties of calcium alginate films was evaluated. The amount of nisin released from calcium alginate films increased significantly (p<0.05) with Ca2+ concentration. The mechanism involved in the diffusion process was investigated using the Power law model. Nisin diffusion from films cross-linked with 0.18M Ca2+ exhibited anomalous behavior, all other films exhibited near-Fickian behavior. Nisin release from these films fitted well to Fick\u2019s second law of diffusion (R2>0.90). The effective diffusivity of nisin into water at 21\u00b0C was of the order 10\u22128 cm2/s and did not change significantly (p>0.05) with Ca2+ concentration. This released nisin retained its antimicrobial activity. Films cross-linked with low Ca2+ concentrations underwent significant swelling. The transparency, tensile strength and elastic modulus of the films decreased, whereas elongation at break increased, with increasing Ca2+ concentration. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7480], "author_name_tesi": "Lalpuria, Minal Prakash", "last_name_ssi": "Lalpuria", "middle_name_ssi": "Prakash", "first_name_ssi": "Minal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "John Coupland", "Ali Demirci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Dissertation Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Chair", "John Coupland, Committee Member", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["antimicrobial packaging", "nisin", "alginate", "diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Mechanistic Model for Lead Rubber Bearings", "id": "13868dbl5205", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13868", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Seismic isolation is a technique used to shift the fundamental period of a structure to a long range period which reduces the forces a structure attracts during a seismic event. Two, widely used bearings in seismic base isolation of structures are elastomeric and lead rubber bearings. A typical elastomeric bearing consists of a number of layers of rubber alternated with steel shims bonded between two rubber layers. The addition of a lead core inserted in a central mandrel hole results in a lead rubber bearing (LRB). The lead enhances the bearings energy dissipating in an earthquake event. When elastomeric or LRBs are simultaneously subjected to vertical compressive load and increasing lateral displacement, the shear force equilibrium path can exhibit a critical point, beyond which the bearing exhibits negative stiffness. Semi-empirical models to simulate this behavior for elastomeric and LRB have been developed in the past. These models rely on experimentally calibrated parameters, making them impractical for design. Recently, a particular mechanics based model, developed for an elastomeric bearing only, approaches the modelling using vertical springs and a simple bi-linear constitutive relationship to represent the rotational behavior of an elastomeric bearing. Overarching goal of the present study is to build on the mechanics based elastomeric model to develop a LRB model. The elastomeric model is modified to include hysteretic behavior of LRB and also uses a Newton type numerical solution technique to solve for response of the bearing. The model, proposed in this study, utilizing vertical springs approach has shown to be capable of simulating the strength, stiffness and hysteretic behavior of LRB well.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14459], "author_name_tesi": "Lalwani, Dipesh Suresh", "last_name_ssi": "Lalwani", "middle_name_ssi": "Suresh", "first_name_ssi": "Dipesh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Gordon P.

Study 1 focused on parent-child social (parent, child, and others present) and dyadic (only parent and child present) time. The results showed that social time with parents declined across adolescence, but dyadic time with mothers and fathers peaked in early and middle adolescence, respectively. Moreover, secondborns\u2019 social time with parents declined more slowly than firstborns\u2019, and gendered time use patterns were more pronounced in boys and in opposite-sex sibling dyads. Additionally, youths who spent more dyadic time with their fathers, on average, had higher general self-worth, and changes in social time with fathers were positively linked to changes in youths\u2019 social competence.

It is also a significant educational and public policy issue that will affect the future economic competitiveness of the United States in the global marketplace. Engineering is arguably the leading national example of a profession in which women are under-represented. Undergraduate engineering programs not only need to attract and retain female students, but they must also provide full access to the educational experiences women must have to develop the engineering skills to succeed in the engineering profession. \n\nThis study explored whether the shift to the \u201csoft\u201d or less technical skills in engineering encouraged by new accreditation standards could potentially have had differential effects for women in engineering from their male counterparts. In particular, this study examined the proposition that program practices and policies, faculty members\u2019 activities, and the experiences of engineering students in college, affect the learning of female students differently than that of male students. The three engineering skills chosen for this study were students\u2019 development of design skills, group skills, and awareness of societal and global issues. Data for this study came from a nationally representative sample of engineering program graduates who received their degrees in 1994 (n = 5,335) and 2004 (n = 4,158), 1,243 faculty, and 147 program chairs at 39 different institutions. This study relied on secondary analysis of data from the Engineering Change study, which assessed changes in student learning associated with the implementation of the new Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000) accreditation standards. \n\nThe findings from the current study shed light on the complexity of the processes at work in female and male students\u2019 learning and the importance of creating models that can guide research on both male and female students\u2019 development and change while in college. Changes in program and faculty activities affected both students\u2019 experiences and their learning, and those effects differed by gender. This study also revealed that students\u2019 in- and out-of-class experiences differed significantly in their influence on female and male students\u2019 development of selected engineering abilities. For learning that occurs in engineering programs, and perhaps many other professional and academic fields, gender seems to moderate the effects of programmatic and faculty activities, as well as the influences of students\u2019 undergraduate experiences. \n\nIt is important for faculty and administrators to understand the differences in learning by women and men in order to identify the best ways to produce female graduates with the skills needed in the workplace (Baxter Magolda, 1992). More needs to be done in engineering education than just helping women to adapt to a traditionally masculine field (Salminen-Karlsson, 2002). Responding to individual students\u2019 needs at each level of learning can strengthen the overall educational experience in and outside of the classroom (Baxter Magolda, 1992). After identifying gender patterns in development and learning, the significant differences reveal that males and females may need different challenges and support systems to ensure their future skill levels. In particular, faculty members can stress applied skills to positively affect female students\u2019 abilities to problem-solve and design solutions, and also use active learning pedagogies in their classes to encourage female students to develop their group skills. In addition, out-of-class experiences seem to be more influential on female students\u2019 development of all three learning outcomes than male students\u2019 development of those same skills. Thus, engineering programs and faculty members could encourage to get involved in activities outside of the classroom, such as studying abroad and involvement in professional society chapters. \n\nConversations about national policies shaping student learning in higher education are likely to suffer when researchers and policy makers discount comprehensive research designs and ignore the role of gender in student learning. National policy probably should not overlook differences in the pathways to learning for male and female students. The desire to find the silver bullet that will enhance learning for all students narrows, rather than enriches, actions and policies. If academic and policy decision-making ignores gender differences in students\u2019 experiences and learning outcomes, a true transformation of male-dominated fields will never occur and women\u2019s experiences and levels of learning will not reach their ultimate potential. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [73], "author_name_tesi": "Lambert, Amber D.", "last_name_ssi": "Lambert", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Amber", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick T Terenzini", "Lisa R Lattuca", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Chair", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Member", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["engineering education", "gender differences", "design skills", "group skills", "women in engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Experimental and Modeling Studies of the Hybrid Physical-Chemical Vapor Deposition of Superconducting Magnesium Diboride Thin Films", "id": "7903", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1551", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "MgB2, with a Tc of 39 K, is a promising material for superconducting electronics and high field magnet applications. The development of deposition processes for MgB2 has been hampered by the unusually high Mg overpressure required for phase stability at elevated temperatures. Hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), a process developed at Penn State, combines thermal decomposition of B2H6 gas with an evaporative Mg flux to deposit MgB2 and is able to provide sufficient Mg overpressure for high temperature MgB2 growth. The HPCVD process does, however, have limitations arising from the original reactor configuration. The substrate and Mg supply are heated on the same inductively heated susceptor, which prevents independent temperature control and limits both the size of substrates and the amount of Mg available for growth.  This in turn limits the useable range of deposition parameters such as substrate temperature and restricts the growth time which is problematic for thick films and coatings.\t\n\tThe goals of this study were to develop an improved understanding of the HPCVD deposition process and design a new HPCVD reactor that addresses and improves upon the limitations of the original configuration. A combination of computational fluid dynamics simulations and growth experiments were used to study the HPCVD process in the original reactor.  A transport and chemistry model for the growth of boron films from B2H6 was developed and used to evaluate new reactor configurations.  The simple chemistry model consists of the gas-phase decomposition of B2H6 to BH3, the adsorption of BH3 onto an activated site to form a BH2-Site complex and the transformation of the complex into a boron film and the growth rates from this model were in quantitative agreement with experimental data.    \nA vertical dual-heater reactor configuration which was interchangeable with the original configuration was then developed to provide independent temperature control of the substrate and Mg source and increased substrate size. MgB2 film growths in this configuration were achieved, with comparable film properties from the original configuration; however the process had poor reproducibility and low growth rates.  Boron film growth experiments and numerical modeling, incorporating the previously developed chemistry model showed that there is substantial B2H6 depletion upstream of the substrate and indicated that this configuration was not an optimal design.\nAn impinging jet reactor configuration was then designed to reduce parasitic deposition upstream of the substrate, yet maintain the independent temperature control of the substrate and Mg source.  Numerical modeling was used to explore process parameters for boron thin film growth and provide a guide for growth experiments.  Initial experiments showed that a balance needed to be established between the loss of B2H6 and the gas-phase nucleation of Mg particles from cold-finger effects induced by the inlet jet flow.  Superconducting MgB2 films were successfully grown in the impinging jet reactor that a Tc of 39.8 K and critical current density greater than 2x106 A/cm2 at zero magnetic field.  The impinging jet configuration introduced a large degree of flexibility in MgB2 deposition with thin axis oriented films deposited at low jet flow rates with improved uniformity and thick coatings with growth rates in excess of 100 &#61549;m/hr at higher jet flow rates.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1535], "author_name_tesi": "Lamborn, Daniel Ray", "last_name_ssi": "Lamborn", "middle_name_ssi": "Ray", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Antonios Armaou", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["magnesium diboride", "superconductor", "numerical modeling", "reactor design", "process development"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effects of State and Trait Body Shame on Health-Related Outcome Measures\n\n\n", "id": "12228", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2872", "defended_at_dtsi": "1977-03-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Body shame, a self-conscious emotion resulting from the perceived failure to meet a cultural appearance ideal as well as the attribution of this failure to the core self, is a common experience for women in Western culture.

Implications for future research include amending the research protocol in order to be able to test causal effects of body shame on health-related factors, testing potential mediation of the relationship between trait body shame and poor health outcomes by health-related factors, and examining other mechanisms, such as cortisol evocation, by which body shame could contribute to poor health outcomes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2868], "author_name_tesi": "Lamont, Jean Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Lamont", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jean", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephanie A Shields", "Stephanie A Shields"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephanie A Shields, Thesis Advisor", "Stephanie A Shields, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["body shame", "health"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Body shame and health information seeking: The roles of body responsiveness and perceived control over health", "id": "18785", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9086", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Body shame predicts participation in poor health behaviors (e.g., smoking, restricted eating) because these behaviors may mitigate appearance concerns.  The present research tests whether body shame can affect a wider range of health behaviors through additional mechanisms.  In addition to appearance concerns, body shame may also diminish body responsiveness, or the valuing of internal bodily signals.  Diminished body responsiveness may decrease the control one perceives having over one\u2019s health, thereby impacting health behaviors that aren\u2019t expected to improve appearance, like health information seeking.  Pilot data revealed that trait body shame predicted increased acute health outcomes, and that diminished body responsiveness and decreased perceived control over health mediated this relationship.  Study 1 tested this same model, but with health information seeking outcome variables.  As expected, body shame predicted diminished body responsiveness.  However, body shame was positively related to measures of health information seeking, and the proposed mediation was not significant.  Because these effects may have been due to measurement issues with the hypothesized mediators, the model was retested in Study 2, but perceived control over health was manipulated.  Trait body shame predicted diminished body responsiveness, which in turn predicted decreased health information seeking, but unexpectedly, this result occurred when perceived control over health was high, rather than low.  This may suggest that, for participants with high trait body shame, the high perceived control over health condition was interpreted as self-blame for negative events that occur within the body, which stifled health information seeking, while the low perceived control over health condition let shame-prone participants off the hook for these negative health outcomes, which increased health information seeking.  In sum, trait body shame predicted poor health behaviors not expected to mitigate appearance concerns, but not via the proposed mechanisms.

Regions where land cover change\nexplained more than 60\\% of the combined signal due to an increase in CO${}_2$ and land cover change\nare confined to the Northern Hemisphere for temperature. For rainfall, the effect was scattered\nover both Northern and Southern Hemispheres and mostly not statistically significant.\nProjected land cover changes produced warming in some regions and cooling in other regions. The\nseasonal warming in many mid to high latitude areas was governed by physiological rather than\nmorphological mechanisms.\n\n2. The effects of present-day (1990) global land use change (i.e. agriculture) on the regional\nclimates of northeastern United States and West Africa were investigated. The GENESIS 2.2 global\nmodel and a climate version of the MM5 Mesoscale model were used for this study. The forcing due\nto global agriculture has a small but appreciable impact on the winter climate over the northeastern\nUnited States. The summer climate was dominated by regional scale processes. The global forcing of\nagriculture does not have an appreciable impact in either winter or summer over West Africa.\n\n3. The climate sensitivity to the specification of 1990 agricultural and urban\nland cover was investigated using a climate version of MM5 over the northeastern United States.\nUrbanization resulted in near-surface temperature increases of more than 1 K over the urban sites\nduring both winter and summer. Urbanization also reduced the diurnal temperature range by about 0.4 K.\nThe increase in summer temperature due to urbanization was more widespread than that due to\nthe effect of agricultural land use. The conversion of forest to agricultural land resulted in a decre\nase\nin temperature of more than 0.5 K during winter and an increase of more than 1 K during summer over th\ne\nsites of perturbation. The reduced temperature during winter is related to snow cover; agricultural\nlands are covered by snow while the trees in non-agricultural areas protrude through the snow, reducing the albedo of the surface. The warming due to agriculture during summer reflects reduced evaporation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [716], "author_name_tesi": "Lamptey, Benjamin Lantei", "last_name_ssi": "Lamptey", "middle_name_ssi": "Lantei", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric James Barron", "Richard B Alley", "David Pollard", "Toby Nahum Carlson", "Paul Plassmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric James Barron, Committee Chair", "Richard B Alley, Committee Member", "David Pollard, Committee Member", "Toby Nahum Carlson, Committee Member", "Paul Plassmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["urbanization", "global and regional climate modeling", "climate change", "vegetation", "land-use/land-cover change"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Lambda Obfuscation", "id": "14279pul139", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the rise of increasingly advanced reverse engineering technique, especially more scalable symbolic execution tools, software obfuscation faces great challenges.

Although these modes are studied separately, it is conceivable that they may be engaged together.  Engaging both strategies may assist an observer in locating an ill-defined target, such as a drowning person.

Scaling-up MFC technologies for practical purposes requires compact architectures and operation under continuous flow conditions. In this study, two types of single-chamber air-cathode reactors were used: cubic (28 mL) and rectangular (170 mL) cells. Different carbon-brush anode configurations were evaluated for these two architectures. The anodic configurations differed from each other in Ti wire (current collector) gauge, carbon fiber diameter, number of brushes connected in parallel, and electrode spacing. MFC performance was assessed in terms of power generation, charge, COD removal, coulombic efficiency and internal resistance.\nMulti-brush cubic MFCs had power densities, coulombic efficiencies and COD removals similar to single-brush systems, regardless of large differences in total specific surface areas of the brushes.  The use of smaller Ti wire diameters did not affect power generation, reducing material use and costs. Electrode loading into the cell (orientation, electrode spacing, projected area anode/cathode) proved to be the most important aspect in overall MFC performance.\nThe rectangular vertical reactors were operated in both fed-batch and continuous mode. Electrode spacing between the cathode and the center of mass of the anode, located in the central axis of the brushes, was the most important factor affecting power production. When all multi-anode systems were maintained at the same electrode distance, larger brush diameters (R3) produced as much as twice the power density than smaller ones (R8) in both operational regimes. Additionally, power generation decreased to half when operation was switched from batch to continuous flow. However, when the multi-anode system with the smallest brush diameters were placed closer to the cathode, having the smallest electrode spacing based on center of mass, this configuration (R8C) produced the largest power densities.

Manufactures supplied custom composition cast materials and off-the-shelf deformation processed (i.e. small diameter rods and thin sheets) NiTiNb alloys, and thus different extents of processing are studied. Microstructure characterization of these materials highlights the impact of processing on micro-constituent morphology. Thermo-mechanical experiments are conducted in order to contrast the mechanical and shape memory properties. Micro-deformation measurements are employed to visualize strain localization associated with the differently processed microstructures. Mechanistic and phenomenological rationale are developed that correlate the micro-constituent morphology and its interaction with the underlying martensitic phase transformation to the mechanical and shape memory behavior.\nThe cast and deformation-processed NiTiNb microstructures are characterized via electron and acoustic microscopy. The microstructures are also altered via annealing. The cast microstructure reveals that the addition of Nb as a ternary element in NiTi results in a microstructure with \u03b2 particles which are primarily Nb in a eutectic mixture with the \u03b1 NiTi(Nb) phase. The eutectic mixture is cellular-like with areas of \u03b1 NiTi(Nb) matrix material in between. The martensitic transformation, which is a reversible diffusionless crystallographic phase change that can be thermally- or stress-induced between a high temperature austenitic phase and low temperature martensitic phase, only takes place in this matrix. Two different deformation-processed alloys are studied; a rolled sheet and an extruded rod. Deformation-processing breaks up the eutectic structure resulting in a composite microstructure with discontinuous aligned second phase Nb-rich \u03b2-particle reinforcements. Annealing causes the Nb-rich particles to grow, and also increases the inter-particle spacing in both cast and deformation processed alloys.\nThe shape memory behavior, characterized via thermal cycling with and without an external stress, and the mechanical properties, characterized from isothermal deformation to failure at different temperatures, are contrasted for cast and deformation-processed microstructures. The stress-free thermal cycling allows us to establish the characteristic transformation temperatures along with the elastic and irreversible energies associated with the transformation. Thermal cycling under load is used to characterize the transformation temperatures, thermal hysteresis, and the recoverable and permanent deformations. The isothermal deformation is used to contrast the stress-induced transformation and subsequent plastic deformation using the critical transformation stress and strain, elastic moduli, yield stress, and strain at failure. The work finds the experimental evidence correlating strain energy relaxation and widening of hysteresis and reverse transformation temperature interval.\nThis comparative study between the cast and deformation processed alloys is augmented by undertaking a multi-scale deformation analysis including digital image correlation to measure micro-scale strain localizations. The strain localizations are characterized in-situ, and allow the comparison of the impact of different micro-constituents on the evolution of localized deformations during the stress-induced transformation and shape memory recovery. Localized regions of high strain accompany the stress-induced transformation in cast alloys that lead to fracture, whereas the stress-induced transformation region in processed alloys has no such strain concentrations.\nThe micro-constituent morphology in both the cast and deformation-processed alloys cause martensite stabilization, however the deformation processed microstructure promotes larger irreversibility and shows evidence of strain energy relaxation that is missing in cast alloys. The eutectic boundaries in the cast microstructure likely prohibit interaction of the martensitic transformation with the particles, and promote large strain localizations during the stress-induced transformation. Such boundaries are missing in the deformation-processed composite microstructure, and thus the particles interact more with the martensitic transformation that leads to the larger irreversibility, improved ductility and better mechanical properties.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11187], "author_name_tesi": "Lanba, Asheesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Lanba", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Asheesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Charles E Bakis", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Allison Michelle Beese"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Reginald Felix Hamilton, Dissertation Advisor", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Allison Michelle Beese, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shape Memory Alloys", "Martensitic Transformation", "Hysteresis", "Microstructure", "Digital Image Correlation", "NiTiNb"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEST PRACTICES THROUGH SIMULATION MODELING\n", "id": "11529", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "281", "abstract_tesi": "Emergency Departments (EDs) are experiencing significant crowding in response to the recent trends of decreasing facility resources and increasing patient volumes (Pitts, Niska, Xu & Burt, 2006).   To manage this increase in demand, process improvement techniques have become a prevalent initiative for hospitals, including the use of simulation. In this thesis, a list of best practices has been formed, in which two were selected for further analysis: provider at triage and bedside registration. The goal of this simulation is to provide a simple and effective tool for aiding the decision making process of adding best practices.\n     First, a baseline simulation model was created to show the current process and resulting performance measures. The ED will have the ability to enter their input parameters to align the model with their specific constraints such as personnel scheduling, processing times, etc. Once the baseline model has been verified to match the EDs process, the addition of models for the best practices will be used to predict the overall effect of the best practice improvement on the system. Performance measures of interest will include times such as: door to triage, door to bed, door to doctor, and length of stay; as well as resources utilizations and patient throughput.\n     These simulation models have been applied to Williamsport Regional Medical Center (WRMC). This hospital is currently reconfiguring its ED and wants to analyze their processes for potential areas of improvement. Inputs were provided by WRMC and were entered into the simulation model to accurately model their current process. The use of the bedside registration best practice model will be used to determine the benefits of implementing this process instead of a full registration after triage; as well as determining which areas in the process bedside registration should be implemented for improved results.

The water droplets impact on the surface and freeze, distorting the shape of the airfoil. The distortion of the airfoil shape increases drag and decreases lift. An event of unsymmetrical shedding can induce vibrations. Ice accretion on fuel vents prevents regular airflow and an increase in pressure may cause the fuel sacks to implode. Ice accretion on control surfaces may change the response of the surfaces. Ice accretion to sensors such a velocity probes is also extremely dangerous. Above issues create a need for Ice Protection Systems (IPS) to be installed onboard any aircraft.\nDesign of Ice Protection System (IPS) is a complex iterative procedure and current modeling tools do not accurately predict the behavior of any particular system. The models can be tested in flight, on the ground and in icing wind tunnels. Inflight tests pose a risk to human life and ground icing tests may not be representative of in-flight icing conditions. Icing wind tunnels are a reduced cost option to test IPS prior to mandatory flight testing for certification purposes. To ensure the data collected for IPS and icing research is accurate it is of importance to ensure certain aerodynamic parameters of the wind tunnel are within pre-established guideline limits. The goal of this research is to calibrate the liquid water content (LWC) and flow turbulence in the vertical test section of the newly built Penn State Icing Tunnel (PSIT) for Appendix C conditions.\n\nThe calibration was performed following the guidelines and limits specified in SAE Aerospace Recommended Practices (ARP) 5905. Initially, nozzle locations were identified to give a uniform cloud in the cross-section. A uniform cloud of 11 inch by 11 inch was obtained in the center of the tunnel section. Four NASA standard nozzles are used to get the even cloud. It was demonstrated that as the speed of air increased in the cross-section the uniformity decreased from 18 inch by 18 inch to 11 inch by 11 inch. The uniformity tests were followed by LWC calibration tests. Supercooled water was sprayed only for two different airline pressures of 15 and 20 psig. For higher air pressures the water droplets froze on exiting the nozzle and fully glaciated ice crystals were obtained at location of evaluation (demonstrating the capability of the tunnel to generate both supercooled clouds and fully glaciated frozen droplets). The objective of the presented work focuses on the calibration of supercooled clouds only (14 FAR Part 25 Appendix C conditions).\nInitial particle size calibration was conducted in the cross-section and further tests were carried out in the AERTS chamber to test the ability of the nozzles to produce different MVD particles sizes. Droplet sizes within and well beyond appendix C conditions were produced from 15 to 200 microns. Particle sizes below 30 microns were reproduced within \u00b1 3 microns. Particle sizes beyond 30 microns and up to 200 microns were produced within 15 percent.\nTurbulence intensity tests were conducted at three different velocities 0 m/s, 17 m/s and 34 m/s. It was found that as speed increased, the centerline turbulence intensity decreased. Speed increase from 17 m/s to 34 m/s dropped the turbulence by 31.25 percent at centerline from 3.84 percent to 2.64 percent. At 17 m/s, an\n\naverage increase in turbulence intensity in the cross-section was observed of about 25 percent when air flow through the nozzle was turned on. At 34 m/s, 0.5 percent average increase was observed. The turbulence intensity on average in the cross-section is within guideline limit but certain locations have turbulence intensities higher than the limits. However, as no tests are expected to be performed so close to the walls of the cross-section, it is of little concern.\nFlow angularity tests were carried out at 17 m/s. The measurement locations were limited due to length of the probe. The yaw angle was read from the protractor installed on the instrument. It has a least count of 0.2 degrees and was recorded less than 0.2 degrees at all the points. The average flow angle for the cross-section is 2.7 degrees and increased by about 13 percent to 3.05 degrees when air flow through the nozzle was turned on. The guidelines prescribe a limit of 3 degrees.

D89 is the target of a unique post-translational modification (PTM), methylthiolation (\u2013SCH3), at its C3 position to form 3-methylthioaspartyl 89.   This reaction is chemically challenging, requiring the activation of an unactivated sp3-hybridized carbon center for insertion of the -SCH3 group. The enzyme responsible for catalyzing this PTM is RimO (ribosomal modification O), a member of the superfamily of enzymes named radical SAM (RS). RS enzymes reductively cleave S-adenosyl-L-methonine (SAM) upon its binding to a reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster to generate methionine and a 5'-deoxyadenosyl 5'-radical (5'-dA\u2022), a potent oxidant.  This radical is used to abstract one of the prochiral hydrogen atoms from C3 of D89, thereby activating it for sulfur- or methylthio-insertion. The protein ligates an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster, known as an auxiliary cluster, in its N-terminal region. This auxiliary cluster is thought to be a sacrificial source of sulfide for the methylthiolation reaction in vitro.  Radical recombination between the substrate and a \u00b53-sulfido ion of the auxiliary cluster would result in a thiolated intermediate of D89.   In addition to its use of SAM as a precursor to a 5'-dA\u2022, RimO also catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from a second molecule of SAM, presumably to the sulfur atom of the thiolated intermediate of D89, or to an acceptor site on the RimO polypeptide that acts as an intermediary that then transfers the methyl group to the inserted sulfur atom and completes the reaction.\nBiochemical experiments described in chapter 2 determined that RimO catalyzes methyl transfer from SAM to an acceptor site on itself in the absence of a chemical reductant or an S12 peptide substrate, indicating that methyl transfer precedes radical chemistry. Radiotracing studies in which RimO was incubated with [14C-methyl]-SAM and the mixture subsequently separated by size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that radioactivity was associated with the protein. HPLC analysis of the protein fraction using an acidic mobile phase resulted in the complete loss of radioactivity from SAM-derived breakdown products, which suggested that the radioactivity was liberated upon treatment with acid.  GC-MS analysis of headspace injections taken from sealed vials containing RimO incubated with SAM or [methyl-d3]-SAM showed production of methanethiol or d3-methanethiol, respectively, indicating that the acid-labile auxiliary [4Fe-4S] cluster was the methyl acceptor site. This methylated cluster intermediate was shown to be chemically and kinetically competent, and the presence of methanethiol in reaction mixtures of RimO resulted in its incorporation in the S12 peptide substrate and also enabled the enzyme to catalyze ~ 3 turnovers.\nRimO from the gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) was characterized and shown to be similar to RimO from T. maritima in chapter 3. One of the key differences of Bt RimO was the fact that the flavodoxin/flavodoxin reductase/NADPH (Fld/Fdx/NADPH) reducing system from Ec was a competent source of electrons required for catalysis, thereby obviating the use of the chemical reductant sodium dithionite. Use of the Fld/Fdx/NADPH reducing system decreased the amount of 5'-deoxyadenosine (5'-dAH) formed abortively\u2014meaning uncoupled from methylthiolated product formation\u2014but did not eliminate it. The flavodoxin semiquinone was used as a spectroscopic handle to estimate that Bt RimO uses ~ 1 electron for each methylthiolated product formed.  It was determined that Bt RimO does not harbor any additional sulfide or persulfide species through the use and quantification of the fluorescent sulfur-labeling reagent, I-AEDANS.\nIn chapter 4, chemoenzymatic synthesis of 3-pro-R and 3-pro-S deuterium-labeled aspartic acid was achieved by exploiting the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by aspartate ammonia-lyase. The resulting product identities and retention of the deuterium label were confirmed by 1H NMR after orthogonal protecting groups appropriate for solid phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) were added. The labeled and protected aspartic compounds were incorporated into synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 83-95 of the S12 protein by SPSS, and confirmation of the correct peptide and retention of the deuterium label was obtained by MALDI-TOF MS. When RimO from Bt and Tm were incubated under turnover conditions with the pro-R or pro-S labeled S12 peptide substrates, observation of deuterium incorporation into 5'-deoxyadenosine occurred only with the peptide substrate containing deuterium at the pro-S position, indicating that the enzyme stereoselectively abstracts the pro-S hydrogen atom from its target substrate. This finding also established the stereochemical course of methylthiolation to occur with inversion of configuration, and the apparent primary kinetic isotope effect for H-atom versus D-atom abstraction of ~ 1.9 indicates that this step is at least partially rate-limiting. Additionally, a large apparent secondary isotope effect of ~1.4 was observed with the pro-R labeled substrate.\nIn chapter 5, the Tm S12 protein was overproduced in Ec, purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions, and slowly refolded to yield homogenous protein after size-exclusion chromatography. S12 was shown to be a competent substrate when incubated with Tm RimO under turnover conditions, with incorporation of an -SCH3 group into S12 observed by MALDI-TOF MS.  Variant proteins of Tm RimO in which one conserved amino acid found in the protein active site was substituted by site-directed mutagenesis were characterized; the specific Tm RimO variant were as follows: K12A, K12Q, Y227A, Y227F, and Q192A. Substitution of K12 with alanine or glutamine abolished 5'-dAH and methylthiolated product formation and decreased both the amount and rate of SAH formation, but did not affect the ability of the K12A variant to bind SAM. These results suggested that the lysine residue may play a minor role in methyl transfer, but is required in some unknown capacity for generation of the 5'-dA\u2022. Both Y227A and Y227F Tm RimO variants catalyzed methyl transfer and formation of 5'-dAH, but in neither reaction was the methylthiolated product observed. Reactions containing either the Y227A or Y227F variant in ~60% D2O resulted in no deuterium enrichment into 5'-deoxyadenosine, suggesting that the 5'-dA\u2022 abstracts a hydrogen atom from a site on the S12 peptide or the RimO protein that is not solvent exchangeable. Substitution of F for Y at position 227 had little effect on the determined dissociation constant for SAM binding compared to the wild-type enzyme as determined by ITC. The Q192A variant was capable of catalyzing the full methylthiolation reaction, albeit it to lower extents and at slower rates compared to the wild-type enzyme, making the role for this conserved residue nebulous.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13681], "author_name_tesi": "Landgraf, Bradley James", "last_name_ssi": "Landgraf", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Bradley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J.

Nanoparticles are used in multiple applications because nanoparticles exhibit different properties than the bulk of the materials.  Materials made with nanoparticles can be stronger and more efficient than materials made with larger particles because nanoparticles provide materials with fewer voids.  Investigation into novel dispersion and passivation techniques for nanoparticles is important to produce systems of well-dispersed nanoparticles that do not degrade in air.  \n\nThe current research investigated three separate dispersion systems.  The first investigation focused on the effects of mechanical dispersion of nanoparticles through ultrasonic dispersion of nanoparticle systems.  The second investigation compared the effects of electrostatic and steric dispersion methods for the dispersion of copper nanoparticles.  The third investigation focused on electrostatic dispersion of nanoparticles and the formation of covalent bonds between the nanoparticles and carbon fibers.\n\nThe current research demonstrated that ultrasonication is not a valid method for nanoparticle dispersion because the force of the collision between the nanoparticles irreparably alters the size and physical structure of nanoparticles.  Three material systems were investigated: ceramic oxide nanoparticles, diamond nanoparticles, and metal nanoparticles.  The size distribution of the particles was measured as a function of sonication time using dynamic light scattering.  The morphology of the particles was observed with transmission electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy.  The ceramic oxide material that was ultrasonically treated was alumina whiskers and platelets.  Ceramic oxide materials are brittle, so the  alumina platelets fractured into smaller particles.  The \u03b3-alumina whiskers were less thermodynamically stable than the platelets and underwent a morphology change in the sonicating solution.  Steric dispersion with Darvan CN and electrostatic dispersion with ionic species did not prevent re-agglomeration after the sonication procedure.  The diamond nanoparticles fractured during the ultrasonic treatment and re-agglomerated to two specific particle size distributions regardless of the sonication procedure.  Steric dispersion with Darvan CN and electrostatic dispersion with ionic species did not prevent the particles from re-agglomerating after the sonicating procedure.  The metal nanoparticles were colloidal gold nanoparticles.  The gold nanoparticles irreversibly agglomerated and underwent bridging and sintering as a result of the heat generated from the collisions between the particles.\nCopper nanoparticles were prepared as a material in a metallic ink for use in a three-dimensional printer.  Well-dispersed copper nanoparticles were necessary to pack into the final printed copper device with few voids, otherwise the printed device would be brittle.  Passivated copper nanoparticles were needed to prevent corrosion of the nanoparticles during the printing procedure.  Templated copper nanoparticles were synthesized using a previously established method.  The copper nanoparticles were dispersed using electrosteric dispersion with citric acid and steric dispersion with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).  The size distribution of the copper particles was observed using dynamic light scattering.  The surface charge of the copper particles as a function of dispersant was measured with zeta potential.  The morphology and the dispersion of the copper particles was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy.  When the dispersant solution contained 10-3 M citric acid adjusted to solution pH 8.5, the particles were well-dispersed but degraded in air within an hour.  When the dispersant solution contained 10-3 M PVP, the copper particles were stable in solution for more than two months and stable in air for more than 24 hours.  Steric dispersion with PVP provided more disperse particles and less corrosion of particles. \n\nA well-known deficiency of currently produced laminated carbon fiber tow reinforced polymer composites is low strength in the material when compressive force is applied to the material.  Carbon fiber tows weakly bond with the polymer, so the fiber tows delaminate from the polymer upon impact and the overall strength of the composite decreases as a result of compressive failure in the composite.  One solution for reducing delamination in carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites utilizes the addition of nano-sized reinforcement  to the surface of the fibers through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), but CVD is a high temperature process that damages carbon fibers.  The current study utilized a low temperature bioconjugation process to covalently attach nanofillers (silicon carbide whiskers, carbon nanofibers) to the surface of carbon fibers.  The surface chemistry of the carbon fibers and the nanofillers was altered by oxidizing the surface of the fibers and nanofillers with nitric acid or water.  The carbon nanofibers were de-agglomerated using an ultrasonic horn, and the surface chemistry of the oxidized nanofillers was altered by condensation of (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) to the surface of the nanofillers.  A modified conjugation method was utilized with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and the stabilizing agent Sulfo-NHS to covalently bond nanofillers to the carbon fibers at room temperature.  The change in the surface chemistry of the carbon fibers and the CNF was confirmed using zeta potential determinations.  The coupling of the CNF to the carbon fibers was confirmed using optical microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy.  Mechanical testing of the tow tension and failure strength of the carbon fibers did not show an increased strength observed for the carbon fibers with covalently-bound nanofillers.

This makes the search for any statistical relationships ambiguous because it is subsequently confounded by incorrect theoretical expectations, which anticipate that these relationships remain consistent across different forms of violent conflict. I address this issue by building a series of new environmental scarcity datasets, which are measured in country-months, and then systematically test for evidence of the ecoviolence theory across various forms of violent conflict. My findings show that the risks of violent conflict, as they relate to these disaggregated measures environmental scarcity, differ substantially and are contingent on both the environmental indicator used and the relationship tested.

With an emphasis on validating and utilizing lattice Boltzmann models in conjunction with x-ray computed microtomography.\n\nThe objective of the first study is to investigate fracture flow characteristics at the pore-scale, and evaluate the influence of the adjacent permeable matrix on the fracture\u2019s permeability. We use X-ray computed microtomography to produce three-dimensional images of a fracture in a permeable medium. These images are processed and directly translated into lattices for single-phase lattice Boltzmann simulations. Three flow simulations are presented for the imaged volume, a simulation of the pore space, the fracture alone and the matrix alone. We show that the fracture permeability increases by a factor of 15.1 due to bypassing of fracture choke points through the matrix pore space. In addition, pore-scale matrix velocities were found to follow a logarithmic function of the distance from the fracture. Finally, our results are compared against previously proposed methods of estimating fracture permeability from fracture roughness, tortuosity, aperture distribution and matrix permeability.\n\nIn the second study we present a pore-scale study of relative permeability dependence on the strength of wettability of homogenous-wet porous media, as well as the dependence of relative permeability on the distribution and severity of wettability alteration of porous media to a mixed-wet state.  A Shan-Chen type multicomponent multiphase lattice Boltzmann model is employed to determine pore-scale fluid distributions and relative permeability.  Mixed-wet states are created \u2013 after pre-simulation of homogeneous-wet porous medium \u2013 by altering the wettability of solid surfaces in contact with the non-wetting phase.  To ensure accurate representation of fluid-solid interfacial areas we compare LB simulation results to experimental measurements of interfacial fluid-fluid and fluid-solid areas determined by x-ray computed microtomography imaging of water and oil distributions in bead packs (Landry et al. 2011).  The LB simulations are found to match experimental trends observed for fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfacial area-saturation relationships.  The relative permeability of both fluids in the homogenous-wet porous media is found to decrease with a decreasing contact angle.  This is attributed to the increasing disconnection of the non-wetting phase and increased fluid-solid interfacial area of the wetting phase.  The relative permeability of both fluids in the altered mixed-wet porous media is found to decrease.  However the significance of the decrease is dependent on the connectivity of the unaltered solid surfaces, with less dependence on the severity of alteration.   \n\nIn the third study we present sequential x-ray computed microtomography (CMT) images of matrix drainage in a fractured sintered glass granule pack.  Sequential imaging captured the capillary-dominated migration of the non-wetting phase front from the fracture to the matrix in a brine-surfactant-Decane system.  The sintered glass granule pack was designed to have minimal pore space beyond the resolution of CMT imaging, so that the pore space of the matrix connected to the fracture could be captured in its entirety.  The segmented image of the pore space was then directly translated to a lattice to simulate the transfer of fluids between the fracture and the matrix using lattice Boltzmann (LB) modeling.  This provided us an opportunity to validate the modeling technique against experimental images at the pore-scale.  Although the surfactant was found to alter the wettability of the originally weakly oil-wet glass to water-wet, the fracture-matrix fluid transfer is found to be a drainage process, showing little to no counter-current migration of the oil-phase.  The LB simulations were found to closely match experimental rates of fracture-matrix fluid transfer, equilibrium saturation, irreducible wetting phase saturation and fluid distributions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8429], "author_name_tesi": "Landry, Christopher James", "last_name_ssi": "Landry", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Dr Li Li", "Russell Taylor Johns", "Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Dissertation Advisor", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Chair", "Dr Li Li, Committee Member", "Russell Taylor Johns, Committee Member", "Dr Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pore-scale", "lattice Boltzmann", "fluid flow", "porous media", "fractured porous media", "permeability", "fracture-matrix fluid transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "IDENTIFYING \u201cPOLLINATOR-FRIENDLY\u201d CULTIVARS FOR GARDENS \nAND GREENROOFS \n", "id": "9646", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2786", "abstract_tesi": "Home gardens and greenroofs have the potential to provide foraging resources for native \nand managed pollinators.

Such analyses require an accurate prediction of the phenomena associated with this regime, including the pressure gradient as well as the distribution of liquid and the interfield rate of exchange between the film and dispersed droplet fields.  In general, the nuclear industry uses transient safety analysis codes, such as COBRA-TF, to predict phenomena of interest for various reactor accident scenarios and ensure the safe design of the system.  COBRA-TF is a best-estimate thermal-hydraulic analysis tool developed for Light Water Reactors (LWR) and the primary feature of COBRA-TF is that it provides a three-field representation of two-phase flow (vapor/non-condensable gases, continuous liquid or films, and dispersed liquid or droplets).  This representation is regarded as the most physically accurate approach for analyzing situations where liquid can coexist in both continuous and discrete forms, as is the case for annular-mist and counter-current flow situations, since substantial differences can exist in the velocity and flow direction for these two fields.  \n\nThe prediction of annular flow situations requires a variety of constitutive relationships to describe the mass, momentum, and energy exchange that occurs between the flow fields and provide closure to the set of momentum equations.  An initial assessment of the predictive capability of COBRA-TF indicated that the modeling package that was used in the baseline version of the code did not provide adequate predictions when a variety of annular flow experiments were simulated.  As a result, the goal of the current study was to assemble a physically-based and self-consistent annular flow modeling package that is amenable to implementation in three-field analysis environments and accurately captures the variation in entrainment and interfacial drag within co-current and counter-current regimes over the pressure range of interest (atmospheric to 2000-psia).  The constitutive relations available in the open-literature were assessed relative to the models employed in the modeling package that was applied in the baseline version of COBRA-TF.  Where necessary, model upgrades were made in an effort to utilize the most appropriate models that are based on either the physics of the flow or developed from experimental data collected over the desired range of conditions.  The models that were incorporated into the newly proposed modeling package were either based on those developed in previous studies or developed uniquely within the current study.  It is important to note that the current study used COBRA-TF to provide the baseline modeling package as a means for comparison and as a vehicle for assessing the newly proposed modeling packages; however, the proposed packages are amenable to implementation into any other three-field analysis tool.\n\nThe proposed modeling packages for co-current and counter-current annular flow are outlined in Chapters 4 and 5, respectively.  The co-current modeling package: 1) applies an interfacial shear model that explicitly accounts for the presence of interfacial waves, 2) idealizes the structure of the interface in a manner that is consistent with both the interfacial shear model and other visual observations, 3) includes three mechanistic-based entrainment rate models (roll wave stripping, Kelvin-Helmholtz lifting, and liquid bridge breakup) that calculate a theoretical entrainment rate for a single wave based on the physical structures and controlling phenomena as they are currently understood for each mechanism, and 4) provides a functional relationship between the actual and theoretical entrainment rates based on comparisons to experimental data to account for any deficiencies that exist in the theoretical model.  This methodology improves the physical basis of the modeling package while simultaneously leveraging the available experimental data to ensure the modeling package is able to accurately reflect the experimental data.  \n\nMeanwhile, the three-field Counter-Current Flow Limitation (CCFL) model developed in the current study is based on an empirical model that has been shown to suitably correlate specific sets of data over a wide range of flow path dimensions and geometries.  The resulting correlation provides a quantitative description of the experimentally determined flooding curve.  The proposed model compares the flow conditions predicted by the code to the results of the user-specified CCFL correlation to determine if the standard set of momentum equations should be replaced with a newly developed set of CCFL momentum equations.  The proposed model also provides appropriate entrainment rate models (pool and excess film) and necessary criterion to exit the model in a stable manner.  In general, this approach provides flexibility to the code user and again leverages the available experimental data to improve the predictive capability of the code since a universal model has yet to be determined for this phenomenon.  While not entirely mechanistic, this approach ensures the proper amount of liquid flow can penetrate these regions, which is preeminent to achieving accurate predictions of coolant and temperature distributions for Loss-of-Coolant Accident (LOCA) scenarios.  Overall the development of this model is a unique aspect of the current study because of the explicit treatment of the entrained field, which previously suggested models did not consider because they were aimed at two-field analysis environments.\n\nThe results of the current study indicate that the inclusion of these newly proposed modeling packages for both co-current and counter-current annular flow has provided increased accuracy in the predictions of phenomena that are of interest to reactor safety analyses.  In particular, the mean relative error in entrained fraction was reduced from 20.2% (underprediction) to 4.5% (overprediction) and the mean relative error in axial pressure gradient was reduced from 108.2% to 7.6% (both overprediction) for co-current upward annular flow situations following the implementation of these packages into COBRA-TF and the code-to-data agreement of several different parameters within the counter-current flow regime was improved significantly.  It was also shown that the proposed co-current annular modeling package: 1) provided reasonable estimates of a variety of more fundamental annular flow parameters such as wave spacing, velocity, and intermittency, and 2) was able to capture the general behavior within the developing flow region.  Both these results provide confidence that the proposed modeling package reasonably reflects the underlying physics of the annular regime.  Moreover, the current study is one of the few works that has examined the predictive capabilities of transient analysis codes within the developing, or non-equilibrium, annular flow region.\n\nThe methodology employed in the current study is not meant to provide a final solution to this complex problem; however, given the importance of these phenomena to the safety analysis of various reactor accident scenarios and the abundance of available experimental data, it would be inopportune not to employ this modeling methodology and improve the predictive capabilities of three-field transient analysis codes until a more viable approach is ascertained.  Regardless, the current study has both provided a functional modeling package that has presently improved the predictive capabilities of three-field analysis tools and established a new baseline for future research and model development activities in this area.  \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3125], "author_name_tesi": "Lane, Jeffrey William", "last_name_ssi": "Lane", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Lawrence E Hochreiter", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Gita Talmage", "Ali Borhan", "\"David L Aumiller, Jr\"", "Jack Brenizer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Dissertation Advisor", "Lawrence E Hochreiter, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Gita Talmage, Committee Member", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "\"David L Aumiller, Jr\", Committee Member", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["safety analysis", "annular flow", "interfacial drag", "entrainment", "ccfl"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Teaching and Learning Innovations in Higher Education: Faculty Perceptions of Sustainability", "id": "5889", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2787", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to describe the perceptions of faculty regarding the factors influencing the sustainability of teaching and learning innovations. Departments and colleges have implemented many new and innovative programs over the years. Some of these have been successful and others have failed (Levine, 1980; Simsek & Louis, 1994; Zaltman, Duncan, & Holbek, 1973). What appears to be neglected from the field of research are studies involving teaching and learning innovations that are adopted by individual faculty members. This lack of attention can have implications for universities, innovation support units, and faculty members who are trying to support, develop, and adopt sustainable teaching and learning innovations. This research is needed in order to better understand the crucial elements that are needed in order for an innovation to have a chance of sustaining once it is implemented. This qualitative multiple case study explores the perceptions of faculty innovators at The Pennsylvania State University regarding the sustainability of their teaching and learning innovations. The study uses a phenomenological framework in order to allow for an in-depth description of the perceptions and experiences of the faculty participants (Morse, 1994). The cases in the study are faculty-initiated course innovation projects sponsored by the Schreyer Institute for Innovation in Learning (an innovation support unit at Penn State) from the fall of 1997 until the spring of 1999. The study uses multiple sources of evidence including archival records, documents, surveys, interviews, physical artifacts, and direct observation to enable triangulation of the data (Yin, 1994).

The topic of early child misbehavior is an important one as empirical research has found early misbehavior to be a good predictor of later delinquency and criminal behavior in adolescence and adulthood. Parents\u2019 use of harsh discipline has been cited as one source of children\u2019s problem behaviors. The relationship between misbehavior and discipline suggests that early childhood experiences play an important role in the development of aggressive and antisocial behaviors. Research has also demonstrated that children often precipitate harsh discipline through their unwanted behaviors. \n\nThis study will examine the relationships between child misbehavior and harsh parental disciplinary responses, specifically psychological aggression, corporal punishment, and physical abuse. The sample comes from the longitudinal cohort study portion of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Children aged 3-15 and their primary caregivers were evaluated at three waves spaced three years apart. Analyses were conducted using cross-lagged and simultaneous structural equation models in AMOS. Two models were examined; the first was the parent effects model, which analyzed the effects of the three types of harsh parental discipline on child misbehavior. The second, the child effects model, analyzed the effects of child misbehavior on parental discipline.\n\nFindings partially supported the parent effects model but were dependent upon child age and type of discipline. The most consistent predictor of child misbehavior was psychological aggression, which had a positive effect on child misbehavior. Similarly, corporal punishment generally increased the likelihood of child misbehavior while physical abuse only increased the likelihood of misbehavior in the oldest children. This suggests that harsh discipline increases the likelihood of misbehavior. In contrast, the child effects model was fully supported. At all ages misbehavior increased the likelihood of harsh discipline, suggesting that children\u2019s misbehavior precipitates discipline. Conclusions and directions for future research are also discussed.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3428], "author_name_tesi": "Lane, Kelsea Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Lane", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Kelsea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard B Felson", "Richard B Felson", "Eric Silver", "D Wayne Osgood", "Ginger A Moore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard B Felson, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard B Felson, Committee Chair", "Eric Silver, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Ginger A Moore, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["child misbehavior", "parental discipline"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Parallel Perils: The Strategic Causes and Consequences of Multiple Civil Conflicts", "id": "28719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is often noted that civil wars have superseded interstate wars as the primary form of conflict in the international system.  What is rarely discussed, however, is that states often find themselves embroiled in parallel conflicts, or multiple civil wars that overlap in time and space.  Through four empirical essays, this dissertation project explores the causes and implications of such parallel conflicts through the strategic spatiality of civil war.  The first essay questions whether the underlying causes of initial and parallel civil wars systematically differ.  I show that, in contrast with the extant literature, these separate types of conflict onsets have dissimilar structural causes, and that by lumping them together we risk conflating the structural foundations of initial and subsequent conflicts.  Furthermore, I show that by separating the onset of initial and parallel civil wars, we can leverage important conflict characteristics, such as the severity and geography of ongoing conflicts, to significantly improve predictions of parallel conflict onsets, considerations which are largely absent from the major theories of civil war.  Building on these broad insights, the second essay explores the puzzle of why some ethnic groups choose to take up arms against the state.  Applying existing theories of conflict contagion between states to the contagion of conflict between ethnic groups within the state, I argue that ongoing conflicts in ethnic groups' geographic proximity provide important resources and information necessary to fight the state, which lowers barriers to entry into conflict.  Similarly, the third essay considers why some politically excluded ethnic groups rebel against the state, arguing that the relationship between ethnopolitical exclusion and civil war is shaped by excluded groups' broader political and strategic neighborhoods.  I first show that neighborhoods of inconsistent ethnopolitical exclusion, by highlighting excluded groups' disadvantages and exacerbating feelings of resentment, lead groups to take up arms.  Paralleling the previous essay, I argue that geographic proximity and relative prevalence of ongoing conflicts in excluded groups' immediate neighborhoods provide logistical and motivational benefits.  Shifting from the study of civil war onset, the last empirical essay examines how the duration of civil war is affected by the spatial distribution of multiple conflicts within the state.  Through a theory of scarce resource division and the loss of strength gradient,  I argue that, as the distance between parallel conflicts increases, states' war-fighting capacities are stretched across multiple fronts, limiting their ability to definitively suppress rebel forces.  These spatial effects, in conjunction with the characteristics of overlapping conflicts, shape the duration of hostilities for by altering the bargaining framework between governments and rebels, leading to interdependent conflict durations.  Taken together, these essays consistently support the notion that accounting not only for the existence of multiple conflicts, but also the spatial distribution of those conflicts throughout the state, yields important insights for the ongoing study of civil war.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11703], "author_name_tesi": "Lane, Matthew Austin", "last_name_ssi": "Lane", "middle_name_ssi": "Austin", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke", "David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Glenn Hunter Palmer", "James A Piazza", "Scott Sigmund Gartner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke, Dissertation Advisor", "David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Member", "Glenn Hunter Palmer, Committee Member", "James A Piazza, Committee Member", "Scott Sigmund Gartner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Civil War", "Intrastate Conflict", "Ethnic Conflict", "Conflict Contagion"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Encountering and Accounts of \"the other:\" Teachers' perceptions and curricular planning following an immersion abroad", "id": "25077", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10996", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While intercultural immersions can have a significant impact on the personal and professional lives of teachers, it is important for immersion providers, like the Fulbright-Hays program, as well as the research community to have a clear picture of how teachers are using these experiences to teach within their classrooms.

Central to this impairment may be the effects of elevated oxidative and nitrosative stress on key enzymes that modulate noradrenergic VC such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and rho-kinase (ROCK).  The purpose of this series of four studies was to investigate the neural and vascular mechanisms underlying the attenuated VC response in aged skin, and specifically, the role of these enzymes in contributing to this deficit.  \n\nThe first study tested the hypothesis that compromised noradrenergic VC in aged skin is due to the depletion of an essential cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), needed in the rate-limited step of norepinephrine (NE) biosynthesis.  Functional changes in forearm skin blood flow were assessed with Laser Doppler flowmetry in response to gradual whole-body cooling and tyramine infusion, which evokes NE release from storage vesicles in sympathetic nerve terminals.  Four microdialysis (MD) fibers were placed in the forearm skin of eleven young (Y) and eleven older (O) human subjects for infusion of 1) Ringers solution (control), 2) 5 mM BH4, 3) BH4 + 10mM ascorbate, and 4) BH4 + adrenoreceptor blockade (5mM yohimbine + 1mM propranolol).  The VC response was lower at the control site in O during both cooling (Y: -34 \u00b1 2, O: -17 \u00b1 2 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.001) and tyramine infusion (Y: -33 \u00b1 4, O: -15 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.001).  BH4 infusion normalized O to Y values during both cooling (Y: -34 \u00b1 4, O: -34 \u00b1 2 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.001) and tyramine infusion (Y: -38 \u00b1 4, O: -35 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.001).  The addition of adrenoreceptor blockade abolished VC in aged skin indicating that BH4 acts through noradrenergic, not cotransmitter, mechanisms.  Local BH4 supplementation augments reflex and tyramine-induced VC in aged skin, suggesting that reduced BH4 bioavailability may contribute to the attenuated VC during whole-body cooling.\n\nThe second study tested the hypothesis that attenuated reflex VC in aged skin may be partly mediated by oxidant-induced reduction in functional substrate and/or cofactor availability required by TH for NE biosynthesis; i.e., tyrosine and BH4, respectively.  Functional changes in skin blood flow were assessed with Laser Doppler flowmetry in response to gradual whole-body cooling and tyramine infusion.  Four microdialysis fibers were placed in the forearm skin of 10 Y and 10 O subjects for infusion of 1) Ringer\u2019s, 2) 0.5 mM L-tyrosine, 3) 5 mM BH4, and 4) BH4 + L-tyrosine.  VC was attenuated at the control site in O during whole-body cooling (Y: -39 \u00b1 3, O: -17 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.01) and tyramine infusion (Y: -41 \u00b1 3, O: -21 \u00b1 4 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.01).  Similar to BH4 (cold, Y: -37 \u00b1 3, O: -36 \u00b1 3; tyramine, Y: 41 \u00b1 2, O: -36 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbase), tyrosine also augmented the VC in O during cooling (Y: -37 \u00b1 4, O: -34 \u00b1 4 %&#916;CVCbase) and tyramine infusion (Y: -40 \u00b1 4, O: -45 \u00b1 4 %&#916;CVCbase), but BH4 + tyrosine did not further augment VC during cooling (Y: -38 \u00b1 4, O: -31 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbase) or tyramine infusion (Y: -36 \u00b1 3, O: -36 \u00b1 5 %&#916;CVCbase).  Individually, both tyrosine and BH4 infusion augmented VC in aged skin, suggesting that their reduced bioavailability may impair NE synthesis and contribute to the attenuated VC response. \n\nThe third study tested the hypothesis that the contribution of ROCK to reflex VC is greater in aged skin.  NOS inhibited sites would be used to control for the putative effects  Cutaneous VC was assessed with Laser Doppler flowmetry and was elicited by 1) whole-body cooling (Tsk = 30.5oC) and 2) infusion of a local physiological concentration of NE (1x10-6M).  Four microdialysis fibers were placed in the forearm skin of 8 Y and 8 O subjects for infusion of 1) Ringers solution, 2) 3 mM fasudil (ROCK inhibition), 3) 20 mM NG-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (NOS inhibition), and 4) both ROCK + NOS inhibitors.  VC was reduced at the control site in O during both cooling (Y: -34 \u00b1 3, O: -18 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbaseline; P<0.001) and NE infusion (Y: -53 \u00b1 4, O: -41 \u00b1 9 %&#916;CVCbaseline; P=0.006).  Fasudil attenuated VC in both age groups during mild cooling; however, this reduction remained only in O but not Y skin during moderate cooling (Y: -30 \u00b1 5, O: -7 \u00b1 1 %&#916;CVCbaseline; P=0.016), and was not altered by NOS inhibition.  Fasudil blunted NE-mediated VC in both age groups (Y: -23 \u00b1 4, O: -7 \u00b1 3 %&#916;CVCbaseline; P<0.01).  Cumulatively, these data suggest that although ROCK modestly contributes to the VC response in young, it is upregulated in aged skin during moderate cooling and mediates approximately half of the total reflex VC response in aged skin.\n\nThe fourth study tested the hypothesis that localized BH4 supplementation would not affect end-organ VC responsiveness to exogenous NE after localized sympathetic nerve blockade.  Two microdialysis fibers were placed in bretylium tosylate-pretreated sites (presynaptically blocks neurotransmitters release from sympathetic adrenergic nerve terminals; iontophoresis, 200 &#956;A for 20 min) on the forearm skin of 10 Y and 10 older O subjects for infusion of 1) Ringer\u2019s (control) and 2) 5 mM BH4.  While local skin temperature was clamped at 34oC, 6 concentrations of NE (10-12, 10-10, 10-8, 10-6, 10-4, 10-2 M) were randomly infused (except the supraphysiological doses) at each laser Doppler site.  Despite prejunctional adrenergic blockade, NE-mediated VC was blunted in aged skin at each NE dose (10-12:  -12 \u00b1 2 vs. -21 \u00b1 2, 10-10: -15 \u00b1 2 vs. -27 \u00b1 1, 10-8: -22 \u00b1 2 vs. -32 \u00b1 2, 10-6: -27 \u00b1 2 vs. -38 \u00b1 1, 10-4: -52 \u00b1 3 vs. -66 \u00b1 5, 10-2: -62 \u00b1 3 vs. -75 \u00b1 4 %&#916;CVCbase; P<0.01), and this response was not affected by pretreatment with BH4 (P>0.05).  Localized BH4 did not affect end-organ responsiveness to exogenous NE suggesting that the effects of BH4 on cutaneous VC are primarily limited to the NE biosynthetic pathway in prejunctional adrenergic nerve terminals.  \n\nThe collective results of this series of studies suggest that compromised noradrenergic function in aged skin has both a pre- and postjunctional component.  The ability for TH to upregulate during cold exposure is suboptimal in aged skin, which is likely due to reduced tyrosine and BH4 bioavailability.  Furthermore, ~50% of the extant reflex VC response in aged skin relies on ROCK; an enzyme that is also upregulated with various age-related vascular diseases. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2509], "author_name_tesi": "Lang, James Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Lang", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Lawrence Kenney Jr.", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr.", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Lacy Marie Alexander", "Kelly J Karpa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Lawrence Kenney Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr., Committee Chair", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Lacy Marie Alexander, Committee Member", "Kelly J Karpa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging", "adrenergic", "skin blood flow", "tetrahydrobiopterin"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Bone Quality, Muscle Mass, and Activity: Relationships and Genetic Influence\n", "id": "6122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6142", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary aim of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for skeletal measures in C57BL/6J x DBA/2 F2 and RI populations of mice.  QTL analysis is based on a genome-wide search for regions of chromosomes that contain a locus or gene that influences the phenotype.  Multiple points along the genome are analyzed to determine the likelihood of a QTL at each position influencing the trait based on finding an association between the genotype of a genetic marker and the trait.  \nMany skeletal studies have reported strong correlations between muscle, skeletal, and body size phenotypes and these correlations add to the difficulty in identifying direct genetic influence on skeletal traits.  Quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been identified for skeletal phenotypes and it is often the case that QTLs for body size (body weight, body length, and lean body mass) phenotypes also map to these same areas.  A QTL identified as influencing bone could act indirectly through body size or muscle mass.  Identifying QTLs that influence skeletal phenotypes that are mediated through body size related pathways is informative, however it is also important to identify QTLs that influence skeletal phenotypes independent of body size.  Removing size effects has been an issue for researchers and traditionally one method of removing the size effect has been through the use of ratios.  This technique and an alternate technique of multiple regression were performed on muscle and skeletal data and the differences in results from these methods of normalization are discussed.  \nThe second aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between muscle mass, skeletal integrity, physical activity/behavior, and the influence of specific genetic loci that were identified for multiple traits in the same chromosomal region.  Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the direct and indirect relationships among activity, muscle and bone factors and five QTLs. \nThis study has isolated and confirmed numerous QLTs influencing bone quality and provides evidence that many QTLs exert effects through complex pathways such as body size, muscle mass, and activity.

My research primarily focuses on pipelines due to their potential to convert large areas, lack of spatial tracking, and limited previous research on their effects to wildlife in northeastern forests. The purpose of this research is to identify and quantify the extent of shale gas related infrastructure and quantify the effects of natural gas pipelines on forest bird communities in northcentral Pennsylvania. At the landscape scale, I quantified surface disturbance resulting from shale gas infrastructure, and at the local scale, I assessed changes in the bird community associated with gas pipelines, and the effect of the best management policy (BMP) to collocate pipelines with existing roads on focal bird species.\n\tFor the landscape analysis (Chapter 2), I used a geographic information system (GIS) approach to determine early changes in forest fragmentation resulting from shale gas development (2005 \u2013 2016). I selected Lycoming County as a representative sample of the northcentral region to quantify the industry\u2019s spatial footprint, habitat fragmentation, and loss of core forest resulting from gas infrastructure. I compared development between public and private land because a number of infrastructure consolidation measures are implemented on public land that may reduce surface disturbance. I also calculated effects of pad placement (and necessary supporting infrastructure) on potential loss of core forest due to future development. I found development resulted in total land conversion of 2689 ha, where the majority of infrastructure was constructed in forest (87%). Pipelines accounted for the single largest portion of the industry\u2019s spatial footprint (51%) and were the largest contributor of the fragmentation of core forest. Loss of core forest was more than double on private land compared to public land. My predictions for future development concluded that the greatest loss of core forest will result from pipeline construction for pads located furthest from existing infrastructure. I recommend a variety of measures to reduce further fragmentation with future development.\nIn Chapter 3, I assessed changes in the bird community associated with natural gas pipelines. I quantified bird use of pipeline right-of-way (ROW) corridors and the effect pipelines have on the bird community within the ROW and adjacent forest. I surveyed recently constructed gathering pipelines (with and without a collocated road) and pre-existing transport pipelines. I measured relative abundance of individual species and 3 vegetation-association groups (forest interior, synanthropic, and early successional) within the ROW, edge forest, and core forest (0, 50, and 150 m from the pipeline edge, respectively). I also examined whether use of pipelines was related to ROW (width, vegetation height, vegetation diversity, presence of a road) and landscape (non-forest land and shale gas intensity within a 1-km site buffer) characteristics. I found synanthropic species had the highest abundance in the ROW, early successional species had the highest abundance in edge forest, while forest interior birds had the highest abundance in core forest. The five most common species in the pipeline ROW (chipping sparrow [Spizella passerine], eastern towhee [Pipilo erythrophthalmus], American robin [Turdus migratorius], dark-eyed junco [Junco hyemalis], and cedar waxwing [Bombycilla cedrorum]) comprised the majority (58%) of detections. Use of pipeline corridors by synanthropic species was not affected by ROW or landscape characteristics, while forest interior species were negatively related to width and non-forest land, and early successional species were negatively related to width yet positively associated with vegetation height, vegetation diversity, and shale gas intensity, which is related to new edge habitat. Pipelines as currently managed with regular mowing results in open herbaceous cover of limited use to forest interior and early successional species yet attracts synanthropic species tolerant of disturbance. I recommend limited mowing of pipelines in favor of spot-application of herbicide to provide early successional habitat similar to power line corridors.\nIn Chapter 4, I examined the effect of the BMP to collocate natural gas pipelines with pre-existing roads on the forest bird community. This practice reduces overall fragmentation; however, impacts to wildlife are unknown. I conducted a paired analysis between forest roads and pipelines collocated with roads. I selected four focal species with different habitat associations including: eastern towhee, chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Modified spot mapping techniques were used to survey focal species and measure several aspects of behavior within and along corridor edges. I found measureable differences in bird behavior within a few years after forest roads were expanded to collocated pipeline corridors. Eastern towhee had a mixed response, where territory density did not differ but territories were closer to the edge at pipeline sites compared to forest road sites suggesting an attraction to the pipeline. Chestnut-sided warblers exhibited a neutral response with no difference in territory density or distribution between the two corridor types; while ovenbirds responded negatively with double the territory density at forest roads compared to pipeline with road sites although proximity of territory did not differ between corridor types. All 3 territorial focal species crossed forest road sites more frequently than pipeline with road sites suggesting the expanded pipeline corridor functions more as a barrier than forest roads. Brown-headed cowbird abundance was higher at pipeline with road sites compared to forest road sites and abundance was positively related to gas development intensity. I summarized trade-offs for collocating pipelines with roads or constructing pipelines without roads on fragmentation and focal species.\nFinally, in Chapter 5, I summarized all findings, compare bird survey techniques used in my research, and made recommendations for pipeline vegetation maintenance and restoration to improve habitat within pipeline corridors. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16052], "author_name_tesi": "Langlois, Lillie Amanda", "last_name_ssi": "Langlois", "middle_name_ssi": "Amanda", "first_name_ssi": "Lillie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham-Brant", "Margaret Brittingham-Brant", "Matthew Marshall", "Douglas Miller", "Robert P Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham-Brant, Dissertation Advisor", "Margaret Brittingham-Brant, Committee Chair", "Matthew Marshall, Committee Member", "Douglas Miller, Committee Member", "Robert P Brooks, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Core forest Forest fragmentation Linear infrastructure Marcellus shale Shale gas development", "Songbirds"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Characterization of Long Chain Branched Isotactic Polypropylene via a Metallocene Catalyst and T-Reagent", "id": "8047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2525", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Long chain branched isotactic polypropylene (LCBPP) was synthesized via the combination of a metallocene catalyst, p-(3-butenyl)styrene (T-reagent), and hydrogen.

For educators, a significant site of engagement is the classroom, where learners can be invited to examine, challenge, and transform personal and societal values associated with (un)sustainability. At the core of such education is transformative learning, which involves experiencing a deep, structural shift in the basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions. Transformative environmental education prompts learners to reshape the unsustainable identities and worldviews they have inherited, with the goal of fostering more sustainable personal and societal ways of being.\n\nTo better understand the process and potential of transformative environmental education, this dissertation uses a case study approach to examine the outcomes of a college-level transformative environmental course.

Mechanical damage, particularly in the form of cracking, is a serious problem which limits MLCC lifetime and performance. The effects on electrical behavior are especially pronounced in ferroelectric dielectrics like the barium titanate used in this thesis. This damage can be a result of thermal shock during soldering, joining stresses due to contraction of cooling solder, or board bending. Previous work has been done to model the residual and applied stresses that lead to mechanical failure, the effects of applied and residuals stresses on the electrical properties of the dielectric, and the mechanisms by which stress effects the ferroelectric properties of the dielectric. Residual stresses arise in MLCCs during processing when cooling after sintering, when the metal portions contract more than the ceramic dielectric. MLCCs with larger numbers of electrodes have greater residual stresses. This thesis explores the influence of residual stresses on the mechanical and electrical response of MLCCs to damage. It also uses a combination of in-situ spatial strain maps created using digital image correlation and tracking (DICT), electrical measurements, and knowledge about the response of ferroelectric dielectric materials to stress to make inferences about both the applied and residual stress states. Ultimately, this thesis demonstrates that the residual stress state of MLCCs dominates the electromechanical damage response of MLCCs and the electromechanical response can be used to probe the residual stress state of an MLCC. The tools used in this thesis and the information gained with them may be useful in the future for designing damage-resistant MLCCs.\n\nThe MLCCs measured in this study showed typical decreasing capacitance and increasing dissipation with increasing AC frequency used in the measurement. When indented with a knoop tip to produce surface damage, the surface crack length increased with indentation force P^(3/2) which is typical behavior for a brittle ceramic. The capacitance of 1000 pf X7R MLCCs with 3 electrodes decreased approximately 1.6% with the placement of a 4 kg indent and 47000 pF MLCCs with 19 electrodes showed a 0.8% decrease even though their electrodes were closer to the indented surface. This suggests that the greater number of electrodes in the 47000 pF MLCCs protected them to some degree from the effects of surface damage, possibly by means of having a greater compressive residual surface stress which would resist formation of mode I cracks. Two sets of 24 MLCCs of each capacitance were also broken in 4-point bending and a Weibull analysis was done using a least squares fit. The 47000 pF MLCCs had a higher characteristic strength of 236 MPa vs. the 1000 pF MLCCs' 190 MPa. Micrographs of the fracture surfaces of preliminary mechanical tests of 100000 pF and 220 pF MLCCs of the same form factor showed that fracture most likely initiated on the tensile surface of the bent beam. This suggests that the MLCCs with more electrodes had a greater residual compressive surface stress which had to be overcome before mode I loaded surface cracks could propagate. Thus, the residual stress in MLCCs can act to some degree as a toughening mechanism.\n\nElectromechanical tests of MLCCs loaded to catastrophic failure in 4-point bending showed a capacitance response with respect increasing stress which had a few distinctive traits. Capacitance would increase, reach a peak, and then decline until the point of fracture. This may be due to the applied stress initially being lower than the residual stress in the tensile edge of the device while compressive stresses at the other edge helped align additional ferroelectric domains with the electric field and increased the dipole moment of the dielectric. The peak and decline could then be due to the applied stress overwhelming the residual stress and causing ferroelectric domains to align perpendicular to the applied electric field, thereby reducing the capacitance. Polished capacitors showed a similar response. DIC of the tensile edge of a polished MLCC showed an increasing tensile strain parallel to the electrodes with increasing stress and also an increasing compressive strain perpendicular to the electrodes. The true tensile strain and true compressive strain both reached approximately 2% before fracture occurred. These measurements were verified by manual calculation. The compressive strain is not predicted by beam theory, and could be a result of the release of tensile residual stresses and realignment of ferroelectric domains with the applied tensile strain. The strain fields computed using DIC also showed many perturbations. The meaning of these perturbations is not yet clear, but they show that DIC can detect small variations within the strain distribution within a MLCC and in the future may be useful in locating failure-initiating flaws or strain due to ferroelectric domain realignment. This thesis has results that demonstrate that these residual stresses can be used to explain the mechanical strength of MLCCs and their electromechanical damage response, and the findings related to the effects of the electrode array on electromechanical damage response could be used in the future to design MLCCs with electrode arrays configured to grant additional damage resistance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7338], "author_name_tesi": "Lanning, Wade Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Lanning", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Wade", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher L Muhlstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher L Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MLCC", "capacitor", "dielectric", "ferroelectric", "dissipation", "DICT", "digital image correlation and tracking"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "STRATEGIC BUNDLING OF GOOD AND BAD NEWS: THE CASE OF VOLUNTARY PATENT DISCLOSURES AND NEGATIVE EARNINGS SURPRISES\n", "id": "6729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "754", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Firms enjoy wide discretion in their disclosure of patent-related events, which investors generally view as \"good news\" announcements.

This was examined through two perspectives \u2014 one simply examining the effect of a technology implementation on safety, and the second identifying the effect of a successful adoption of a technology on safety. It was hypothesized that technologies with factors that lead to successful adoption will have a greater safety impact.\n\nNegative binomial regression models with the dependent variables of three separate measures of safety were utilized to test each technology, and the overall results were mixed. The models for on-board safety monitoring technologies (that did not rate high on average for any adoption factor) illustrated no significant effect on safety; however, the models for technologies in both the freight mobility area and the electronic clearance area illustrated a negative effect on safety. In addition, the results for two specific technologies revealed that the companies who have implemented these technologies and rated the adoption factors higher (e.g., successfully adopted the technology) are likely to have fewer accidents than companies who implemented these technologies and rated the adoption factors lower. \n\nThe main implication of this study for both commercial vehicle companies and government agencies is that simply implementing a technology, or advocating implementing a technology, may not give a desired result, and in some cases may even result in a negative impact on safety. The company needs to take the time to learn the technology and integrate it fully into the company in the right way in order for it to have a positive impact. Similarly, government agencies should examine companies that have successfully implemented certain technologies and that have a good safety record to determine the steps they took during the implementation. Providing this information to other companies examining implementing a technology could prove very useful and assist them toward a positive safety impact from the technology.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [732], "author_name_tesi": "Lantz, Brenda M.", "last_name_ssi": "Lantz", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Brenda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Management - Business Adminstration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Swan", "Alan J Stenger", "John C Spychalski", "Paul Peter Jovanis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Swan, Committee Chair", "Alan J Stenger, Committee Chair", "John C Spychalski, Committee Member", "Paul Peter Jovanis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["technology adoption", "safety", "commercial vehicle"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Co-offending in Burglary: A Network Approach", "id": "19854", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9478", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Burglars commonly offend in groups, but even when they work alone they often learn about possible targets through networks of friends and relatives.  The present analysis employs a network analysis perspective to investigate co-offending in burglary.  Three questions are considered.  First, who commits burglary offenses alone, and who chooses to offend in groups?  Second, what are the conditions associated with group offending, and what types of burglary offenses are committed by co-offending groups? And finally, how do characteristics of the co-offending group influence burglary offending and target selection?  \nThese questions are investigated using data from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing (PCS) and the Centre County Probation and Parole Department.  Information on offenders is recorded, as well as ties between offenders.  Offender and offense networks are visualized and analyzed.  Finally, several of the network measures are then incorporated into Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) predicting three offending outcomes: value of goods stolen, successful offense completion, and total time until arrest.  \nConsistent with past research, the results demonstrate that young offenders are more likely to offend with others, and with more total partners.  While the typical burglary offender is young, the typical co-offender is about 23 years old, roughly 4 years younger than offenders who commit crimes alone. \nThe instrumental perspective on co-offending, which posits that offenders choose to offend with others in order to increase offense success and reduce offense risk, was supported by the results.  Offenses involving more than one offender are more successful than offenses involving solo offenders.  Theft value is significantly increased for offenses involving multiple offenders. Co-offenses are also significantly more likely to be completed successfully (i.e., without interruption by residents or police).  \nGroup density, a measure of group cohesiveness, plays an important role in offense outcome.  Subgroups of higher density are more likely to be successful than groups of lower density.  Dense groups are more likely to complete offenses than other groups, as well as to steal goods of higher value.  These effects of density are probably due to the likelihood that subgroups with more cohesion and trust are able to function as a group more successfully.  \nFinally, the use of a two-mode network structure permits a unique examination of repeat victimization offenses.  The results demonstrate that group processes within the network are particularly important in the occurrence of multiple victimization offenses.  Three possible mechanisms of repeat victimization are tested: (1) characteristics of a location make the target attractive to all motivated offenders, (2) the same offender returns to the offense location multiple times, or (3) the primary offender notifies other offenders, to whom he is tied, about the target.  The results are consistent with the third explanation.  Group processes appear to play a significant role in multiple victimizations.  Multiple victimization offenses are significantly more likely to be committed by offenders from within a subgroup, compared to isolates.  Further, most repeat victimization offenses are committed by offenders within the same subgroup, rather than from different subgroups.  Taken together, the results suggest that group processes are a particularly important mechanism of repeat victimization.  \n\tThe results suggest two implications for theory.  First, the instrumental perspective of co-offending is supported.  Offenders who offend with others are more likely to be successful, suggesting that the offender decides whether or not to commit co-offenses based on a rational choice framework.  Second, the prevalence of subgroups across burglary offenders suggests that interaction is important.  A significant network is shown to be operating in Centre County, suggesting the prevalence of even larger networks in areas of higher population density and higher crime rates.  The network was also constructed using sentencing data, and might be much larger if additional data on non-sanctioned offending were considered.  \n\tFinally, the present study has three policy implications.  First, co-offending is important, and is conceptually different from solo offending.  Co-offenses appear to be more serious, as higher valued goods are stolen, and are more likely to be completed successfully in the short term.  Thus, from a crime control perspective, criminal justice resources need to be directed at co-offending groups.\nSecond, the prevalence of group offending makes clear the importance of examining interaction processes in offending.  Understanding how information is shared among group members and transmitted to other groups would be important for intervening in order to prevent crimes.  \nThird, in terms of apprehension, arrests are made in a shorter amount of time for multiple offender offenses compared to solo offenses.  But, in addition to the arrest, group membership must also be considered.  If group membership is not considered, arresting only one offender may lead to little to no effect on the overall crime output of the group.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9268], "author_name_tesi": "Lantz, Brendan Gregg", "last_name_ssi": "Lantz", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregg", "first_name_ssi": "Brendan", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry Ruback"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry Ruback, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Burglary", "Co-Offending", "Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Consequences of Crime in Company: An Analysis of Co-offending Group Violence and Arrest Patterns in the NIBRS Data, 2003-2012", "id": "14302bgl119", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14302", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "People commit acts as members of groups they would not commit alone.  By taking advantage of the large sample size and segmented data structure of the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data, this study assesses three aspects of the group nature of offending.  Study 1 investigates the hypothesis that companions facilitate more severe offending.  Results demonstrate that offenses committed by groups are more likely than offenses committed by a single offender to involve victim injury and to involve weapon use.  The effect of groups on offense severity is also moderated by whether members of the group know the victim: offenses committed by groups against strangers are particularly likely to involve weapon use and to result in victim injury.  \nStudy 2 argues that groups should be considered jointly with characteristics of individual group members.  Results suggest three important findings.   First, groups containing a higher proportion of male offenders, compared to female offenders, are more likely than other groups to seriously injure victims.  Second, this gender effect varies according to the size of the co-offending group, such that gender matters more in smaller groups.  Third, age is related to the likelihood of group violence, such that the presence of young adult offenders is associated with increased risk of serious injury.  \nStudy 3  examines the relationship between co-offending and the likelihood of arrest, with three important findings.  First, there is heterogeneity in the relationship between co-offending and arrest by offense type.  Co-offending reduces the risk of apprehension for those who commit assault offenses, while offending with accomplices increases the risk of arrest for those who commit robbery or homicide offenses.  Second, there is heterogeneity in the relationship between co-offending and arrest by demographic composition of the co-offender group.  Co-offending in minority groups, for example, is increasingly risky as the size of a co-offending group increases.  Finally, results from a within-incident analysis suggest that male co-offenders are more likely than their female partners to be arrested, that black co-offenders are more likely than their white partners to be arrested, and that younger co-offenders are more likely than their older partners to be arrested.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14724], "author_name_tesi": "Lantz, Brendan Gregg", "last_name_ssi": "Lantz", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregg", "first_name_ssi": "Brendan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Criminology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Richard Barry Ruback", "Jeremy Staff", "D Wayne Osgood", "Scott David Gest", "Holly Nguyen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Barry Ruback, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Scott David Gest, Outside Member", "Holly Nguyen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Co-offending", "NIBRS", "Violence", "Crime Clearance", "Group Crime"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Role of the Auxiliary Iron-sulfur Cluster of Lipoyl Synthase in the Biosynthesis of the Lipoyl Cofactor", "id": "27378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11896", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lipoic acid is an essential cofactor found in all domains of life.  It is a simple cofactor composed of an eight-carbon fatty acid chain with sulfur atoms inserted at C6 and C8.  The de novo biosynthesis of lipoic acid consists of two dedicated steps.  In the first step, an octanoyl transferase, LipB, transfers an octanoyl chain from an acyl-carrier protein to a lipoyl carrier protein (LCP).  The octanoyl-LCP serves as the substrate for the second enzyme, lipoyl synthase (LipA).  LipA belongs to a superfamily known as radical SAM (RS) enzymes that use a reduced [4Fe\u20134S] cluster to reductively cleave S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to methionine and a potent 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl-5\u2032-radical (5\u2032-dA\u2022).  LipA uses two equivalents of 5\u2032-dA\u2022 to abstract hydrogen atoms from C6 and C8 of the octanoyl chain in a stepwise manner, cleaving two unactivated C\u2013H bonds of the substrate.  In addition to the [4Fe\u20134S] cluster required for radical chemistry, LipA contains an auxiliary [4Fe\u20134S] cluster that is used as the source of sulfide for the reaction.  Radical recombination of the substrate with two of the bridging \u00b53-sulfido ions of the auxiliary cluster results in the intact lipoyl cofactor.\nIsolation and characterization of the monothiolated intermediate conclusively determined that a covalent cross-link is formed between the octanoyl group of the substrate protein or peptide and the auxiliary iron\u2013sulfur cluster of LipA.  This intermediate is shown to be catalytically and kinetically competent to form product.  A detailed spectroscopic analysis using M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy revealed that the formation of the cross-linked intermediate corresponds to the loss of an iron ion from the auxiliary cluster, leaving a 3Fe species attached to the substrate. \nWhen a conjugated substrate analogue, an LCP with a 2,4-hexadienoyl moiety attached to the appropriate lysine, is used, a substrate radical can be trapped and observed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.  This substrate was reacted with 57Fe-labeled LipA, and hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy, a pulsed EPR technique, was employed.  The substrate radical was shown to interact with the auxiliary iron\u2013sulfur cluster of LipA, and the distance of the radical was mapped to within 2 \u00c5 of the cluster, positioning the substrate to react with the sulfide ions of the cluster.\nAn analysis of the LipA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtLipA) showed that this enzyme contains the same cluster species as found in the enzyme from Escherichia coli (EcLipA).  The reaction of MtLipA proceeds through the same intermediate with similar kinetics.  MtLipA can also complement lipA auxotrophic mutants of E. coli, demonstrating the similarity of the two enzymes.  However, the oligomeric state of MtLipA differs from that of EcLipA.  EcLipA exists as a mixture of monomers and dimmers that can vary based on the buffer solution and presence or absence of SAM.  MtLipA, on the other hand, exists solely as a monomer under the conditions tested.  It was also found that the substrate specificity of LipA can be reduced to just the octanoyllysine moiety.\nFinally, recently solved X-ray crystal structures of LipA provided a hint as to the role of a conserved RSSY motif found in the C-terminal tail of LipA.  The arginine of this motif was found to be critical for binding of the substrate to LipA.  The second serine of the motif acts as a ligand to the fourth iron ion of the auxiliary cluster.    Activity of LipA is greatly diminished when this residue is substituted with an alanine or a phenylalanine.  Furthermore, when the serine ligand is substituted with a cysteine, the enzyme is capable of generating a monothiolated intermediate, but cannot form the lipoyl product.  Instead, an aberrant unsaturated fatty acyl product is formed.  A spectroscopic analysis of the intermediate formed by the Ser to Cys variant showed that the 3Fe species is not generated by this enzyme, and a high-spin [4Fe\u20134S] cluster is found in its place.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11349], "author_name_tesi": "Lanz, Nicholas David", "last_name_ssi": "Lanz", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J Booker", "Carsten Krebs", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Squire J Booker, Dissertation Advisor", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lipoyl Synthase", "Lipoic Acid", "Radical SAM", "S-Adenosylmethionine", "M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy", "Iron-sulfur cluster"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Pythium and Phytopythium species frequently found in irrigation water", "id": "25954", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11572", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Some Pythium and Phytopythium species are problematic greenhouse crop pathogens. This project aimed to determine if pathogenic Pythium species are harbored in greenhouse recycled irrigation water tanks and to determine the ecology of the Pythium species found in these tanks. In previous research, an extensive water survey was performed on the recycled irrigation water tanks of two commercial greenhouses in Pennsylvania that experience frequent poinsettia crop loss due to Pythium aphanidermatum. In that work, only a preliminary identification of the baited species was made. Here, detailed analyses of the isolates were conducted. The Pythium and Phytopythium species recovered during the survey by baiting the water were identified and assessed for pathogenicity in lab and greenhouse experiments. The Pythium species found during the tank surveys were: a species genetically very similar to P. sp. nov. OOMYA1702-08 in Clade B2, two distinct species of unknown identity in Clade E2, P. coloratum or one of the very closely related species such as P. diclinum, P. middletonii, an unknown species in Clade B2, an isolate somewhat similar to P. sp. nov. OOMYA1646-08 (E2), P. rostratifingens, and an unknown species in Clade A. In addition, three Phytopythium species were found: Phytopythium litorale, Ph. helicoides, and Ph. chamaehyphon. Many of these species are considered weak pathogens and some display resistance to the Oomycete fungicide, mefenoxam.  Of the baited isolates, seven expressed resistance (Ph. helicoides, Clade E2-2 unknown, P. middletonii, P. sp. nov. OOMYA1646-08 (E2),) with three displaying high resistance (P. coloratum, P. rostratifingens, Clade A unknown). Seven expressed sensitivity (Ph. helicoides, Clade B2 unknown, P. sp. nov. OOMYA1646-08 (E2), Ph. chamaehyphon) with three displaying high sensitivity (Clade E2-1 unknown, P. coloratum, Clade E2-2 unknown). In a lab experiment, using Pelargonium X hortorum seeds germinated on moistened filter paper, some of the baited isolates were pathogenic. However in another test using small pots containing pasteurized, peat-based soilless potting mix, none of the baited isolates were pathogenic on geranium seedlings. It was assessed whether or not these isolates that were frequently obtained by baiting interfere with known pathogenic Pythium species, P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, and P. cryptoirregulare, in disease development. Some of the isolates slowed or promoted plant disease in the lab test using geranium seedlings on moistened filter paper, but these results were unable to be reproduced in the greenhouse experiments under more natural production conditions. At the end of the greenhouse experiments, root sections were plated in order to recover isolates. It was found that in the co-inoculated plants, P. irregulare and P. cryptoirregulare were almost always the only species recovered from the roots. The baited isolates were still recovered from the roots in the control plants. Lastly, a simulation of the greenhouse ebb and flood irrigation system was set up to determine if P. aphanidermatum can coexist with representatives of the frequently baited isolates in recycled irrigation water tanks. P. aphanidermatum was not recovered from any of the tanks or on the roots of plants the tanks watered. We conclude that there is an array of Pythium and Phytopythium species that reside in greenhouse irrigation systems, and that P. aphanidermatum is not one of those species. Thus, treating irrigation water with chlorine or other chemicals to remove Pythium spp. may not be necessary in greenhouses where potted plants are irrigated with recycled water. We also conclude that the highly virulent species Pythium irregulare and Pythium cryptoirregulare have attributes that allow them to dominate the niche of plant roots over those species frequently found in the irrigation water.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11076], "author_name_tesi": "Lanze, Carla Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Lanze", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Carla", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary William Moorman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary William Moorman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pythium", "phytopythium", "recycled irrigation water", "greenhouse", "plant pathogen", "mefenoxam", "new species", "pythium apanidermatum"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Vehicle Rollover Prediction for Banked Surfaces\n", "id": "11452", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rollover accidents are one of the leading causes of death on the highway due to their very high fatality rate.

This work develops a vehicle rollover prediction algorithm that is based on a kinematic analysis of vehicle motion, a method that allows explicit inclusion of terrain effects. The solution approach utilizes the concept of zero-moment point (ZMP) that is typically applied to walking robot dynamics. This concept is introduced in terms of a lower-order model of vehicle roll dynamics to measure the vehicle rollover propensity, and the resulting ZMP prediction allows a direct measure of a vehicle rollover threat index.

However, the high nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) content of the concentrate diets may contribute to poor gastrointestinal (GIT) health. Increased epithelial permeability (leaky gut) and ulceration are two possible consequences of feeding large amounts of starch (> 4g/kg BW) in a concentrated dose, such as during meal feeding. Equine Squamous Gastric Disease (ESGD) affects 50-90% of athletic horses, and can contribute to poor performance and overall health. Dietary risk factors include time without feed and low forage or high starch/grain diets. Low forage or high starch/grain diets can also increase gut leakiness in horses, leading to passage of toxins and microbes into the body. These health concerns can be mitigated with diets higher in fiber and lower in starch.  A well-studied concept in ruminant nutrition is physically effective fiber (PEF) and the effects of dietary particle size on ruminal health. Exploring benefits of including PEF in equine diets may shed light on decreasing poor GIT health associated with high starch diets. Whole oats are higher in fiber, due to the hull, and lower in density compared to most other grains such as corn. Therefore, they may be good sources of energy and PEF that will supply horses with adequate energy while simultaneously helping to mitigate poor GIT health due to feeding high starch grain. It was hypothesized that diets with increasing particle size, decreasing starch, and inclusion of whole oats would result in a decrease of gastric ulcer severity and gastrointestinal permeability. Eight geldings (528 \u00b1 54 kg BW) ranging from 3-15 yr were used in a Latin Square design. Four dietary treatments fed at 2% BW were 100% hay (HA); 40% hay and 55% whole oats (HO); 40% hay, 27.5% whole oats, and 27.5% pellets (HOP); and 40% hay and 55% pellets (HP). Differences in dietary particle size are characterized by percent feed particle length < 1.18 mm in the HA, HO, HOP, and HP diets (1, 5, 33, and 60 %; respectively). Pellets were formulated to have similar nutrient makeup to whole oats. To balance nutrient content HO, HP, and HOP diets had a balancer pellet added at 5%. Treatments were divided into four 14 d periods; each proceeded by a 14 d hay only washout period. The last period was followed by a 14 d washout and a 7 d ulcer induction as a positive control.  The dietary particle size profiles of hay and oats were obtained using the Penn State Particle Separator and particle size of pellets were provided by the feed company. Endoscopies were performed on day 13 of every period in addition to day 7 of the ulcer induction. Video endoscopies were evaluated by 4 graders blinded to treatments. An established grading scale was used to evaluate 4 separate regions: greater curvature (GC), lesser curvature (LC), body (BD), esophageal orifice (EO), and an overall squamous mucosa score. Previously validated sugar absorption tests were used to measure GIT permeability at the end of each period. Mannitol, sucrose, lactulose, and sucralose were administered orally in solution and total urine was collected for 24 hours. Pooled 24 h and 0 to 6 h urine samples were preserved with 10% thymol solution and frozen at -20\u00b0C until analyzed for sugar excretion. A previously validated alditol acetate derivatization was used and sugar was quantified using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. A mixed ANOVA was used to investigate differences due to fixed effects of diet and period. Differences were defined at p < 0.05. The only effect of diet on ulcer severity was a lower ulcer score for the LC region in the HA (1.1 \u00b1 0.2) group compared to HO, HOP, and HP (1.6 \u00b1 0.2, 2.0 \u00b1 0.2, 1.8 \u00b1 0.2; respectively) groups. Total ulcer scores for ulcer induction (2.2 \u00b1 0.2) were higher than during washout (1.5 \u00b1 0.1) and treatment (1.6 \u00b1 0.1) periods.  There was an effect of diet on sugar excretion for all sugars for total 24 h urine pools, characterized by the HP group generally having a higher permeability. Results of this study support the idea that larger dietary particle size, i.e. hay, may reduce ESGD risk. These results also indicate that diets with higher % of smaller feed particles may result in increased GIT permeability. Permeability following ulcer induction was lower than treatment or washout periods. This challenges the effective use of permeability, measured as sugar excretion, in determining clinical ulceration.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14347], "author_name_tesi": "Lapinskas, Siga Laura", "last_name_ssi": "Lapinskas", "middle_name_ssi": "Laura", "first_name_ssi": "Siga", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William B.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a large role in mediating the damage of such injuries, and promoting survival of glia is one way by which damage to the CNS can be abrogated. Activation of gp130 by one of its ligands, including IL-6 family member leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), has been shown to promote survival of CNS cells in a number of disease models. This work sought to explore the mechanisms by which LIF can promote survival of CNS cells against oxidative damage by using a cultured mouse astrocyte model of cell death. Experimental results showed that LIF promotes survival of cultured astrocytes against exposure to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t- BHP) by decreasing intracellular ROS. To elucidate the mechanism of LIF-induced survival signaling pathways downstream of gp130\u2014including the JAK/Stat3, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT pathways\u2014were examined. Blockade of the MAPK/ERK pathway with PD98059 or the PI3K/AKT pathway with LY29004 did not prevent the protective effects of LIF. A GFAP-cre \u00d7 Stat3flox/flox genetic mouse model was used to produce astrocytes lacking functional Stat3 (St3KO astrocytes). Results of these experiments showed that LIF is ineffective at protecting astrocytes from oxidative stress in the absence of proper Stat3 function, and LIF does not decrease intracellular ROS in astrocytes lacking functional Stat3. Since mitochondria are a major source of endogenous ROS,,mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) was evaluated in LIF- treated astrocytes revealing that LIF lowers \u0394\u03a8m, correlating with a decrease in mitochondrial ROS generation. To examine the cause for decreased \u0394\u03a8m further studies tested the role of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), which is known to be able decrease \u0394\u03a8m and to prevent CNS cell death. Both chemical inhibition and siRNA knockdown of UCP2 prevented the protective effect of LIF in astrocytes. Because Stat3 is also important to the capability of LIF to prevent ROS-induced death experiments with St3KO astrocytes explored whether LIF could be regulating UCP2 through Stat3. While LIF increased UCP2 mRNA in wild-type astrocytes, UCP2 mRNA was significantly decreased in astrocytes lacking functional Stat3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that LIF causes Stat3 to bind to the UCP2 promoter. Importantly, LIF pretreatment alone does not significantly increase UCP2 protein levels, however exposure to t-BHP results in a significant increase in UCP2 protein levels in LIF- pretreated astrocytes. In conclusion, LIF increases survival of astrocytes against toxic ROS by activating Stat3 allowing it to bind to the UCP2 promoter and increase the UCP2 mRNA pool. Exposure to oxidative stress causes this UCP2 mRNA pool to be translated to protein, resulting in decreased \u0394\u03a8m and decreased mitochondrial ROS generation. By selectively decreasing endogenous ROS production through this mechanism, astrocytes are able to maintain an intracellular ROS burden that remains below toxic levels, which in turn promotes their survival under the types of toxic oxidative stress seen in pathological processes such as ischemia and traumatic brain injury.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10129], "author_name_tesi": "Lapp, Daniel Wesley", "last_name_ssi": "Lapp", "middle_name_ssi": "Wesley", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Colin James Barnstable", "Colin James Barnstable", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Alistair J Barber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Colin James Barnstable, Dissertation Advisor", "Colin James Barnstable, Committee Chair", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stat3", "Uncoupling Protein 2", "oxidative stress", "astrocyte"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Rabid Dog, the Third Shooter, and Fifty Head of Cattle: Mythos and Logos in the Culture of American Criminal Justice", "id": "25751", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11359", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation holds that the operation of criminal justice in America \u2013 the day- to-day practices of adjudication and enforcement \u2013 is characterized by two faculties which occupy the larger and more inclusive realm of sovereignty: the forceful and the rational.

Such systems are typically referred to as lab-on-a-chip (LoC) systems or micro-total-analysis-systems (\u00b5TAS). These systems hope to revolutionize medical diagnostics by decreasing both the size and cost of diagnostic systems. \n\nIn order to realize such a feat, radical new designs must be implemented in these systems. Furthermore, it is difficult to remain in one scientific discipline while working in this field. These integrated systems quickly become complicated with concerns in fluid dynamics, electronics, nanophotonics, acoustics, etc. Researchers must be versatile in this field and ready to learn new technologies as we push for smaller diagnostic systems with improved performance. \n\nThe title of this dissertation is a tribute to the multi-disciplinary atmosphere in the microfluidics field. The contributions in this dissertation involve design of complex fluid systems, optical detection techniques, and acoustic manipulation. This dissertation is organized into five chapters. Chapter 1 introduces microfluidic point-of-care systems, some basics of microfluidics, the integration of optics with microfluidics (optofluidics), and the integration of acoustics with microfluidics (acoustofluidics). \n\nChapter 2 describes several of the experimental methods which are common across all of the subsequent chapters. The microfabrication method (utilizing ultraviolet (UV) photolithograph, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon, and mold replica production of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)) used to fabricate microfluidic channels is described in detail. The integration of optical fibers with microfludic channels is described, and the purpose for single-mode and multimode optical fibers is explained. The process of designing integrated microlenses in PDMS using a ray tracing simulation programed in MATLAB is described. \n\nChapter 3 introduces several systems based on optical reflection. A variable optical attenuator was developed using optofluidic integration of optical fibers with a reflection-based signal transduction method. An optical switch was designed using bulk acoustic waves to alter the reflectivity of an optical interface and tune the output of the switch. This project was an interesting combination of acoustic, optical and microfluidic systems. The final technology described in chapter 3 is the application of reflection-based sensing for monitoring diffusive mass transfer in a microfluidic channel. This system utilized simple fabrication processes and was able to detect refractive index, viscosity, and diffusion. \n\nIn chapter 4, interference based detection is utilized for three projects. The first project introduced a simple, but highly sensitive, optical interferometer that easily integrates with any typical microfluidic system. This interferometer could detect minute changes in refractive index, and to demonstrate a biosensing application, various concentrations of the protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) were detected using the interferometer. The second installment of chapter 4 describes a system which integrates droplet microfluidics with interferometry for high throughput analysis. This system was able to detect concentrations of calcium chloride, glucose and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000. In the third project, a bubble was trapped in the active region of the interferometer. The interferometer could detect acoustic oscillations of the bubble on the order of a few microns. This could have applications in characterizing acoustic oscillations of bubbles, measuring fluid parameters such as viscosity and surface tension, or possibly even detect material properties of artificial cell membranes. Extensive video processing was used to analyze videos captured with a high speed camera. Oscillations of the bubble at 135 kHz push the limit of the 500,000 frames per second camera and a program was written to use time-to-period correlation to reconstruct the oscillation at this high frequency. Interestingly, the interferometer could easily recored the oscillations of the bubble at this frequency.\n\nChapter 5 introduces a system integrating microfluidic flow focusing, optical detection and acoustic sorting to produce a highly integrated fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) system. In this system, the CD-45 receptor of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) was tagged with a antibody-fluorescent complex. This is a good model for testing the FACS system, because this is a standard method for tagging cell for flow cytometry, as opposed to using fluorescent beads to test the system. An integrated optofludic system was designed to detect both fluorescent on non-fluorescent cells. A custom electrical feedback system was created to trigger sorting of the fluorescent cells. Surface acoustic waves (SAW), generated by on-chip, interdigitated transducers (IDTs), were used to sort the cells. Such a system could have a drastic impact on the miniaturization of flow cytometry systems. \n\nThis dissertation represents a strong multi-disciplinary contribution to the microfluidic and point-of-care diagnostic fields. It has been as serious undertaking that has provided the author with a wide range of skills in theoretical modeling, data analysis, project management, communication, and team work. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8039], "author_name_tesi": "Lapsley, Michael Ian", "last_name_ssi": "Lapsley", "middle_name_ssi": "Ian", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jian Xu", "Mark William Horn", "Iam Choon Khoo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microfluidics", "optics", "optofluidics", "acoustics", "acoustofluidics", "reflection", "refractometer", "interferometer", "cell sorting", "FACS"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Coping and Relational Infidelity Across the Lifespan: The Role of Commitment During Relational Distress\n", "id": "11751", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3840", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Studies in areas such as counseling psychology, social psychology, and sociology have extensively covered infidelity, including gender differences for initiating the behavior, predictors for relational satisfaction, and the trust issues associated with infidelity (see Treas & Giesen, 2000).

In order to understand the role of communication in romantic relationships following infidelity, adults ranging in age from 18-84 (N = 288) who were presently involved in romantic relationships were surveyed regarding attitudes towards exclusivity in their relationships, commitment to the relationship, and possible strategies for coping with the transgression. A research question regarding variance in coping strategies across the lifespan yielded significant results, indicating that coping strategies do vary according to age. Another research question that examined coping strategies according to attitudes of exclusivity yielded no significant results.

Density, depth ranges, and growth rates of L. pertusa colonies were calculated from video and image analysis. L. pertusa colonies were present on all structures examined. Minimum calculated growth rates for the largest colonies ranged from 0.32 to 3.23 cm/year on the different structures.  Colony density varied with structure type, age, and depth, with of the highest density between 503-518 m on the single structure that spanned the entire depth range of occurrence of L. pertusa.  L. pertusa on thinner and deeper, hydrocarbon structure types (spar and tension leg platforms) appear to have higher colonization rates as the support higher densities in less time. However, on average, colonies have slower growth rates on these structures than colonies on more massive, shallower hydrocarbon structure types (compliant and solid platforms). In general, the calculated minimum growth rates were higher on the hydrocarbon installations than on the shipwrecks, which were substantially older.  A continuum of colony sizes was documented on all installations, suggesting multiple settlement events. L. pertusa thickets were observed on the oldest structures with most structural components covered by colonies of L. pertusa. The shallowest depth of L. pertusa observed was at 201 m and the deepest at 801 m, considerably expanding the known depth range of the species in the northern GoM.
