Asymptomatic cattle are colonized with EHEC O157:H7 at the mucosal interface of the recto-anal junction (RAJ), and coincidentally this colonization of the RAJ is critical for the ability of this organism to be shed from the cattle.  Super shedding (SS) is a phenomenon that has been reported in some cattle that shed EHEC O157:H7 at a rate greater than 104 colony forming units per gram of feces (CFU/g), 100-1000 times more or greater than normal shedders.  The critical nature of colonization of the RAJ and shedding of EHEC O157:H7 indicated that this interaction might have been changed at a cellular level.  The development of a unique cattle RAJ cell culture model revealed that O157:H7 employ a LEE-independent mechanism of attachment to the other RAJ cell type, recto-anal squamous epithelial (RSE) cells.  SS isolates show a strong aggregative and adherence phenotype on RAJ cells, as opposed to two other O157:H7 strains, 86-24 and EDL933, which is also independent of the LEE operon.  Other data show that these SS isolates have a higher affinity of binding leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, which is important because contaminated leafy greens serve as another major route of transmission of this pathogen.  Since biofilms have been implicated in colonization and bacterial survival in a variety of environments, we investigated if SS17 could form biofilms, and the data indicate that SS17 has an enhanced ability to form biofilms compared to non-pathogenic E. coli strain K12 as well as EDL933 (a strain not believed to be an SS isolate).   Recently, a representative SS isolate, SS17, was fully sequenced, and its genome was analyzed for changes in the genome (deletions and/or acquisition of novel genes) as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), focusing on virulence and adherence related genes.  These analyses revealed that SS17 contained 295 virulence related genes, of which 39 had coding non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs).  Of the 9 genes that were chosen through a rigorous selection process, none had a complete conservation of the same nsSNP in all 11 other SS isolates but were used to generate a phylogenetic analysis of the representative SS isolates.  None of the genes chosen were shown to be individually essential for the change in adherence phenotype to the RSE cells seen in SS17; however, ompA, eivA, yfaL, and wzzB gene deletions in EDL933 were able to switch the phenotype in EDL933 from moderate aggregative to strong aggregative attachment seen in SS17.  These data indicate that they may play a role in this phenotype but in an inhibitory manner and that a protein(s) they interact with may be involved directly.  In SS17 it has now been shown that yfaL is critically important for the production of biofilm in context of leafy green extract; as is cah and ompA; but it is unclear if the nsSNPs exhibited by the two former genes have to do with the enhanced biofilm formation exhibited by SS17.  All three show importance to the enhanced biofilm formation of SS17, and yfaL and ompA have for the first time been shown to be critical to biofilm formation in a strain of EHEC O157:H7; and all 3 important for SS17s ability to produce biofilms induced by factors released by damaged leaves.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8939], "author_name_tesi": "Moreau, Matthew R", "last_name_ssi": "Moreau", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vivek Kapur", "Edward G Dudley", "Subhashinie Kariyawasam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vivek Kapur, Thesis Advisor", "Edward G Dudley, Thesis Advisor", "Subhashinie Kariyawasam, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["E. coli", "Pathogen", "O157:H7", "EHEC", "Biofilms", "Reservoir", "Super Shedder", "Cow", "Leafy Greens", "Comparative Genomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Pathogenomics and Source Dynamics of Salmonella enterica Serovar Enteritidis\n", "id": "25075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11149", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) is one of the most frequent common causes of morbidity and mortality in humans due to consumption of contaminated eggs and egg products. The association between egg contamination and foodborne outbreaks of SE suggests egg derived SE might be more adept to cause human illness than SE from other sources.  Therefore, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of egg-derived SE to colonize the chicken intestinal and reproductive tracts and cause disease in the human host.  To this end, the present study was carried out in three objectives.  \nThe first objective was to sequence two egg-derived SE isolates belonging to the PFGE type JEGX01.0004 to identify the genes that might be involved in SE colonization and/or pathogenesis.  Both genomes were almost identical (99% identity) being approximately 4.67Mb in size and the GC content was 52%.  Both genomes contained about 4,600 open reading frames, of which 600 (or 12.5% of the genome) were related to virulence.  Nine genes contained single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) when these virulence-associated genes of egg isolated SE were compared with human isolated SE providing evidence of host-adapted microevolution of SE.  Among these SNPs, two resulted in non-conservative changes in a fimbrial usher and a lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene, whereas four SNPs were located in promoter regions.  \nThe second objective of the study was to identify the host-specific genes (poultry vs. human) by pan-genomic analysis of the newly sequenced genomes and the genomes of Salmonella serovars published in the NCBI database.  There were approximately 2, 800 cluster of orthologous genes (COGs) conserved among all serovars tested of which 247 were associated with Salmonella virulence.  These core virulence genes may be associated with colonization and/or subsequent infection in all host species whereas the \u2018host-specific\u2019 genes most likely determine the host-specific mechanisms.  This analysis identified 10 poultry-specific potential virulence genes, including the genes of two fimbrial operons, lpf- and sti- and four genes with hypothetical functions.  Twelve other genes (e. g. iroD, ttrB/C, and sthA) were present only in Salmonella serovars that can infect the human host. \nThe third objective of the study was to elucidate if the source attributes have an effect on SE virulence. Here, the colonization ability and virulence potential of SE grown in Luria broth (LB) medium and egg yolk in the laboratory and SE recovered from feces of mice experimentally infected with SE) were compared using a mouse colitis model of SE infection.  The results demonstrated that SE grown in the egg yolk possesses enhanced colonization, shedding, and virulence capabilities as compared to the SE grown in the LB medium or SE recovered from mouse feces as determined by clinical signs, gross pathology, histological lesion scoring, and bacterial enumeration of feces, small and large intestines, and internal organs of the infected mice.  These data suggest that egg yolk may condition SE to be better \u2018primed\u2019 for transmission to and infection of a second host by upregulating the expression of certain genes.  Future studies should be directed towards understanding the mechanisms involved in microevolution of SE virulence in egg yolk using approaches, such as microarray and RNA sequencing.\nIn conclusion, this study provides new insights into the current understanding of SE virulence and identifies potential targets for rational development of vaccines and antimicrobials to minimize human foodborne illness due to SE.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10712], "author_name_tesi": "Moreau, Matthew R", "last_name_ssi": "Moreau", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Subhashinie Kariyawasam", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Mary J Kennett", "Matam Vijay Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Subhashinie Kariyawasam, Dissertation Advisor", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "Matam Vijay Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Salmonella Enteritidis", "Pathogenomics", "Source dynamics", "Molecular mechanisms", "host-pathogen interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Understanding Exoplanet Populations with Simulation-based Methods", "id": "mc87pq25t", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Kepler candidate catalog represents an unprecedented sample of exoplanet host stars. This dataset is ideal for probing the populations of exoplanet systems and exploring their architectures. Confirming transiting exoplanets candidates through traditional follow-up methods is challenging, especially for faint host stars. Most of Kepler\u2019s validated planets relied on statistical methods to separate true planets from false-positives. Multiple transiting planet systems (MTPS) have been previously shown to have low false-positive rates and over 850 planets in MTPSs have been statistically validated so far. We show that the period-normalized transit duration ratio (\u03be) offers additional information that can be used to establish the planetary nature of these systems. We briefly discuss the observed distribution of \u03be for the Q1-Q17 Kepler Candidate Search. We also use \u03be to develop a Bayesian statistical framework combined with Monte Carlo methods to determine which pairs of planet candidates in an MTPS are consistent with the planet hypothesis for a sample of 862 MTPSs that include candidate planets, confirmed planets, and known false-positives. This analysis proves to be efficient and advantageous in that it only requires catalog-level bulk candidate properties and galactic population modeling to compute the probabilities of a myriad of feasible scenarios composed of background and companion stellar blends in the photometric aperture, without needing additional observational follow-up. Our results agree with the previous results of a low false-positive rate in the Kepler MTPSs. This implies, independently of any other estimates, that most of the MTPSs detected by Kepler are planetary in nature, but that a substantial fraction could be orbiting stars other than then the putative target star, and therefore may be subject to significant error in the inferred planet parameters resulting from unknown or mismeasured stellar host attributes.\n\nWe also apply approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) using forward simulations of the Kepler planet catalog to simultaneously constrain the distributions of mutual inclination between the planets, orbital eccentricity, the underlying number of planets per planetary system, and the fraction of stars that host planet systems in a subsample of Kepler candidate planets using SimpleABC, a Python package we developed that is a general-purpose framework for ABC analysis. For our investigation into planet architectures, we limit our investigation to candidates in orbits from 10 to 320 days, where the false-positive contamination rate is expected to be low. We test two models, the first is an independent eccentricity (e) model where mutual inclination and e are drawn from Rayleigh distributions with dispersions \u03c3im and \u03c3e, planets per planetary system is drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean \u03bb, and the fraction of stars with planetary systems is drawn from two-state categorical distribution parameterized by \u03b7p. We also test an Equipartition Model identical to the Independent e Model, except that \u03c3e is linked to \u03c3im by a scaling factor \u03b3 . Our results, especially the Equipartition Model, are in good agreement with previous studies. However, deficiencies in our single population models suggest that at least one additional subpopulation of planet systems is needed to explain the Kepler sample, providing more confirmation of the so-called \u201cKepler Dichotomy\u201d.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12523], "author_name_tesi": "Morehead, Robert C.", "last_name_ssi": "Morehead", "middle_name_ssi": "C.", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric B Ford", "Eric B Ford", "Jason Thomas Wright", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "G.

New structural and geomorphic analyses on the Burica peninsula, an outer forearc peninsula located only ~100 km inboard the Panama Triple Junction, reveal that the peninsula is dominated primarily by contractional deformation along three listric thrust faults that root in the underlying plate boundary. The geometry and spatial distribution of these thrusts indicate that this deformation occurs primarily in response to the change in crustal thickness occurring as a result of eastern migration of the flank of the Cocos Ridge coeval with migration of the Panama Triple Junction at a rate of ~55 mm/yr to the southeast. Mapping and detailed elevation surveys reveal eight marine terraces on the peninsula with a distribution of inner edge elevations indicating that uplift is spatially uniform from north to south along-strike in this area. Age control provided by 14C, OSL and soil chronosequences indicate that the terraces within the easternmost portion of the peninsula range in age from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS)-3 to Holocene, a result that indicates that this portion of the peninsula is younger than ~60 ka.  Time-averaged uplift rates calculated from marine terraces and other Quaternary marine deposits yield consistent uplift rates that range between 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 7.7 +/- 0.5 mm/yr for samples older than 1 ka and between 6.9 +/- 1.0 to 19.3 +/- 8.0 mm/yr for samples younger than 1 ka.  We interpret this temporal distribution in uplift rates to suggest that the 8 terraces preserved on the peninsula are produced co-seismically wherein the anomalously high uplift rates calculated from the youngest samples (< 1 ka) are not yet averaged over a complete seismic cycle.  These observations, combined with 1) shortening estimates from balanced cross-sections indicating that minimum shortening decreases from northwest to southeast as well as 2) the observation of growth strata within the youngest marine units, are consistent with a space-for-time model for triple junction migration. \nNew geomorphic and longitudinal profile analyses combined with revised plate reconstruction models provide a new perspective with which to view the evolution of the Central American volcanic arc.  We identify a low-relief surface in the northeastern flanks of the Cordillera de Talamanca, the late Miocene volcanic arc of southern Costa Rica, which, combined with longitudinal profile analyses, suggests the existence of a transient landscape within this region.    Rock uplift calculations based on channel reconstruction by extrapolation of the current low-relief surface estimate that the rock uplift associated with this transient is on the order of ~2 km since the inception of the transient.  Our results from a synthesis of radiometric ages combined with newly revised plate reconstruction models suggest that arc cessation between both the Cordillera de Talamanca and the Cordillera Central of western Panama occurred coeval with the initiation of oblique subduction of the Nazca plate during the late Miocene.  This revision to previous plate reconstruction models, which relies on revised magnetic plate anomalies associated with the extinction of the Sandra Rift in the east Panama basin, suggests the existence of a North Nazca microplate prior to ~8-9 Ma, as well as a 2-fold decrease in convergence rate at this time.  These results suggest that initiation of shallow subduction of the Cocos Ridge at the Middle American Trench, which has long been associated with the volcanic extinction of the Cordillera de Talamanca, occurred at ~ 1.5-2 Ma: more than ~7 million years after the extinction of the Central American volcanic arc. \nWe also use new geologic, stratigraphic and geomorphic data along with age constraints to characterize the Late Pleistocene to Holocene sequence of deposits associated with edifice failure and sector collapse of the active Volc\u00e1n Bar\u00fa (alt. 3374 m) in westernmost Panama.  This new stratigraphic control provides new constraints on the timing of thrusting associated with termination of the Fila Coste\u00f1a inner forearc thrust belt, which is migrating to the southeast coeval with the Panama Triple Junction. Radiocarbon dating of organic material, together with 40Ar/39Ar ages from clasts within the deposits, identify at least three debris avalanche events (DA1, DA2 and DA3). Preliminary volume estimates for the youngest deposit (DA3) range from a minimum of ~30 km3 to a maximum of ~60 km3. Radiocarbon analysis of wood and other organic material extracted from this debris avalanche (n=3) yield ages that range between 8, 625 +/- 75 YBP and 12, 845 +/- 55 YBP. The oldest deposit contains a soil profile that appears significantly more developed than younger deposits and yields ages > 44,000 YBP. 40Ar/39Ar dating of plagioclase feldspar crystals extracted from clasts within the DA1 deposit, however, yield dates as young as 231 +/- 32 ka, constraining the lower age boundary. We map and distinguish three lithofacies for the debris avalanche, which we establish on the basis of surface morphology, abundance of clasts, and matrix composition. Finally, we also present new results regarding the kinematics, timing and evolution of the Fila Coste\u00f1a Thrust Belt for many of the thrusts that intersect the volcanic units characterized here. These results include new shortening amounts based on balanced cross-sections within thrusts that cut surficial lahar units, as well as the recognition of new thrust structures that place constraints on thrust timing within this region.\n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3367], "author_name_tesi": "Morell, Kristin Diane", "last_name_ssi": "Morell", "middle_name_ssi": "Diane", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald F Isher", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Eric Kirby", "Derek Elsworth", "Peter Christopher Lafemina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald F Isher, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Chair", "Eric Kirby, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Panama Triple Junction", "neotectonics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Workflow to Enable Effective Uncertaimty Propagation and Decreasing Bias on Predictive Models Used For Field Development Decisions", "id": "13366jcm218", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this research is to enhance the overall reliability of subsurface models used for production forecasting with the purpose of reserves classification and field development decisions in brown fields. Given the inaccurate and sparse nature of subsurface measurements used to build subsurface models, it is deemed essential to address quantification of the impact of uncertainty on production forecasting and assessment of remaining hydrocarbon potential. To achieve these objectives, traditional workflows for deterministic and stochastic subsurface modeling with significant production history were reviewed and fundamental key steps believed to inhibit the ability to propagate uncertainty from geological modeling to production forecasting were addressed. In general three main aspects of industry-wide established workflows were revised - namely, model upscaling, history matching, and probabilistic forecasting.\nIn the context of this research, upscaling referred to the process of homogenizing reservoir properties inferred from well logs (approximately 1ft vertically) to accommodate a model grid allowing to perform numerical simulation. There is another level of homogenization related to observations and measurements done on cores and how they relate to log properties. Such upscaling was not addressed in this research mainly due to the \u2013more often than not \u2013 condition of not having enough and representative core coverage. In the past, upscaling has been governed by decision timelines, computer power limitations, and overall dynamic model runtimes. To address the upscaling process, recent advances in parallel computing, load balancing, and scalable linear solvers were successfully implemented avoiding the need for model coarsening.\nThe second aspect refers to the calibration of subsurface models with production information. The use of diagnostic plots as objective function was implemented as a way to address non-uniqueness. Diagnostic plots have proved to be a valuable tool to identify production behavior associated with particular geological characters. It also allows segregating some of the non-reservoir observed behavior. Diagnostic plots were used as a guide to pre-condition static models prior to numerical simulation, and as an objective function to optimize and reduce the difference between simulated and observed behavior stochastically.\nHaving achieved a geologically consistent dynamic calibration stochastically, probabilistic production forecasting and identification of bypassed hydrocarbon zones were performed with the aim of stochastic reserves classification and mapping of bypassed zones making the selection of production enhancement initiatives and infill prospects more effective. \nThe workflow was tested using a conceptual model of known properties where it was possible to track the propagation of uncertainty in terms of property error and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between observed data and simulated results. As a result, the workflow provided a seamless platform to integrate geological and dynamic uncertainty and allows one to perform dynamic conditioning and history match using parameters governing propagation of geological properties, thereby reducing the need for artificial modifiers. Results showed a consistent reduction of error in terms of properties after dynamic conditioning and history match, and also a significant reduction in terms of RMSE on the ensemble of models. Having a robust ensemble within reasonable ranges of RMSE, the set of models was used for reserves assessment and classification showing that the true model reserves estimate fell well within 1P and 3P estimates and very close to 2P estimates as calculated probabilistically from the ensemble. In addition, when inspecting remaining prospective areas using remaining mobile oil maps, there was a good agreement of potential areas between the true model areas, and the average of the potential zones from all realizations on the ensemble. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13626], "author_name_tesi": "Moreno, Juan Carlos", "last_name_ssi": "Moreno", "middle_name_ssi": "Carlos", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Eugene C Morgan", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Elizabeth Ann Hajek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Eugene C Morgan, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Ann Hajek, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Uncertainty", "field development", "predictive models", "risk on field development", "history match", "dynamic conditioning", "ensemble"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANNUAL VARIATIONS IN GROUND-WATER TEMPERATURE AS A TRACER OF\nRIVER-AQUIFER INTERACTIONS\n\n", "id": "8007", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2056", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, annual and diurnal variations in aquifer temperature have increasingly been used to investigate surface-water-ground-water interactions.  This thesis represents three separate but related investigations into the value of annual temperature in characterizing and quantifying infiltration from surface-water bodies.\nCurrently, there is a great deal of interest in the exchange between the Rio Grande and the underlying aquifer in Albuquerque, New Mexico so that surface stream depletion can be properly estimated.  The USGS has collected temperature time series in a series of piezometers along a profile perpendicular to the river to characterize horizontal flow.  The current method for interpreting these data is to calibrate a 2-D numerical model of the aquifer, a process that can be time-consuming.  We propose that a simple 1-D analytical solution can be used to estimate horizontal flux through an aquifer based on temperature variations.  This analytical model does not fully represent all of the factors that contribute to aquifer temperature signals, but in many cases it may represent the system sufficiently well to produce a useful estimate of ground-water flux.  \nAt the Mohawk River site near Schenectady, NY, a large number of wells drilled to characterize induced infiltration have permitted spatially extensive measurements of the annual variation in aquifer temperature.  These data show a zone of high temperature variation caused by a plume of infiltrated river water pulled towards municipal supply wells.  The aquifer at the site is highly transmissive, so we developed a method-of-characteristics, particle-tracking code to model the advection-dominated thermal transport.  Our model of the site shows that the plume of high temperature variation is caused by aquifer thickening over a known bedrock depression.  The annual temperature variation data were also sensitive to the magnitude and spatial variation of the riverbed conductance.  The results of this study suggest that numerical modeling is required to fully understand temperature data collected in aquifers with complex geometries.\nIf the spatial distribution of temperature measurements is sufficiently dense, then high transmissivity zones acting as preferential flow paths for infiltrated surface-water can be identified.  A limitation of this method is that ground-water temperature can be measured only in wells or in natural discharge points.  For some shallow aquifers, however, this temperature reversal can be seen in temperature measurements taken in shallow soil borings.  By collecting temperature data in a large number of shallow soil borings, preferential flow paths in shallow soil borings can be mapped.   In this paper we model soil temperature variations, investigate the range of conditions under which aquifer temperature variations can be detected, and demonstrate the technique with a data set from a site along the Mohawk River near Schenectady, New York.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2038], "author_name_tesi": "Moret, Geoffrey John Maxted", "last_name_ssi": "Moret", "middle_name_ssi": "John Maxted", "first_name_ssi": "Geoffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Rudolph Parizek", "Charles James Ammon", "Derek Elsworth", "Demian Saffer", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Rudolph Parizek, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogeology", "temperature"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Interaction of Frames, Culture and Resources In The Ukrainian Women's Movement:  An Analysis of Kyiv, Kharkiv and L'viv\n", "id": "7996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4609", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines the emerging Ukrainian women\u2019s movement in 2002 and 2003 in three regionally distinct Ukrainian cities; Kyiv, Kharkiv, and L\u2019viv.

Access is an important issue in terms of the digital divide, so the search for health information was used as an exemplar of social access, to understand how attributes of individual people influence the process.  In studying health information searching, the population that was chosen was individuals with diabetes.  Diabetes was chosen because it is a chronic disease which requires a high degree of self management.  As a result of this high requirement on the part of the patient to monitor his or her condition, the activity of health information seeking becomes critically important.  Therefore, this fact provides a potential source of motivation for these individuals to search for health information that is relevant. The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of human variation on people\u2019s perspectives about, and approaches to, the activity of information searching, on the topic of health.\nThis research employed an interpretive epistemological approach which consisted of a three part mixed method study.  The study was comprised of a user search task, an individual differences questionnaire, and in-depth interviews with fifteen Black and fifteen White participants in central Pennsylvania and southern Maryland.  It was found that  differences such as race, gender, age, socio economic class, and geographic location all influence searching behavior.  However, it was also found that these factors work together to influence behavior, rather than independently.  Therefore, it is suggested that researchers of health information searching behavior look at the intersection of characteristics rather than single attributes of individuals.  Also, the Internet was found to augment traditional information resources instead of acting as the central information resource.  This finding is supported by factors which were found to be mediators of health information searching such as personal social networks, trust, and frustration.  Lastly, stereotypes were challenged as participants in the study exhibited behaviors which were contradictory to research about Internet experience and searching.  \nThis research has created a contribution to theory, to the literature, to methodology, and to practice.  The contribution to theory has been developed through the support for and extension of the explanatory power of the Individual Differences Theory of Gender and IT.  The findings in this study showed evidence that users of technology have rich and unique experiences, backgrounds and beliefs, which impacted their usage of technology.  In addition, the findings in this research project enhance knowledge about health information sources and their importance in the lives of individuals with chronic illnesses.  New knowledge was developed about many factors which lessen the motivation to search, and subsequently about how life, health and technology intersect in the existence of thirty individuals all living with diabetes. This research contributed to the knowledge base on methodology as a mixed-methodology study which utilized an interpretive epistemology.  This study utilized a three part research design in which data was collected to better understand user behavior and perceptions for the purpose of integrating information to answer the research questions.  Lastly, this research contributed to practice through the development of a research process which can be used as a technique to inform personas.  The data collection process used in this research can be used as an effective aid to gather empirical information about a user.  The information gathered in this research represents an embodied view of the user, or rather a comprehensive view which provides information about individual demographics, experiences, influences, behaviors, and perceptions of technology use.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [169], "author_name_tesi": "Morgan, Allison Janeice", "last_name_ssi": "Morgan", "middle_name_ssi": "Janeice", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth", "Eileen M Trauth", "Lynette Kvasny", "Bernard James Jansen", "Dr. Ronald Jackson II"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth, Dissertation Advisor", "Eileen M Trauth, Committee Chair", "Lynette Kvasny, Committee Member", "Bernard James Jansen, Committee Member", "Dr. Ronald Jackson II, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Human information behavior", "Individual differences", "Race", "Health information", "Web searching", "Diversity", "Human variation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Micrometer-Scale Supersonic Slit Jet Nozzle Design, Simulation, and Additive Fabrication for Direct Laser Acceleration", "id": "24910", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11137", "abstract_tesi": "Millimeter- and micrometer-scale fluid and gas jets have multiple applications in research, industry, and government, such as gas duct injection, fluid flow research, materials research, and nuclear security science and technology.

Machining methods often require milling solid metal components and joining parts with welds that can result in leakage or turbulence in the flow system.   Various implementations of laser particle acceleration rely upon specially designed flow systems that can produce uniform gas density profiles of order millimeter in length and micrometer in height. The resulting gas density profiles can support  acceleration of electrons using short laser pulses, a promising and rapidly developing technology for scientific, medical, industrial, and security applications.

Here the focus is instead on intensity-based methods that directly minimize the intensity residual between viewpoints. These methods require a good initialization, which is implicitly provided by video because the transformation between frames is small allowing each frame to initialize the next frame. The goal of this thesis is to analyze the feasibility of intensity-based bundle adjustment for dense reconstructions and compare this to recent work on multi view stereo.\n\nThe proposed method optimizes the inverse depth of a reference frame rather than explicit 3D points, which leads to a significantly more efficient algorithm. Dense reconstructions are possible because the sparsity of the bundle adjustment problem can be exploited to achieve linear runtime with respect to the number of points. The greatest advantage over existing algorithms is that special initialization cases are not required. Each point is tracked through the video, and therefore the inverse depth and camera pose are always a feasible explanation for what was observed.

Existing empirical studies demonstrate that broad indicators of parent involvement are positively associated with children\u2019s academic success. However, longitudinal studies that clarify the role of preschool participation in promoting parent involvement and that link specific components of parental involvement to specific dimensions of emergent literacy skills are needed. This dissertation has two primary goals: (1) to clarify how parent involvement changes as a result of one year compared to two years of a universal preschool program; and (2) to clarify how specific domains of parent involvement predict to children\u2019s emergent literacy skills in Kindergarten. Preschool children (ages 3-4 years) and their parents were recruited from a very disadvantaged Northeastern urban community. The total analytic sample included 290 children (n=145 entered at age 3; n=145 entered at age 4). Three hypotheses were partially supported. The first hypothesis was that a longer duration of preschool programming (2 years versus 1 year) would result in increased parent involvement. By using matched propensity score analyses, findings suggest that two years of preschool programming, compared to one year, improved parent-child talking activities and parent emergent literacy practices at home. Also, two years of preschool programming was marginally related to parents \u201cshowing up\u201d at school (e.g., volunteering in class, field trips, and attending school wide events). The second hypothesis was that the quality of teacher-parent interactions would help explain the increased parent involvement. Teacher\u2019s ratings of the quality of the relationship with the parent were positively related to parents making more visits to the library. The third hypothesis was that greater parent involvement would improve children\u2019s school readiness skills, specifically emergent literacy skills. Parent talking activities predicted Kindergarten receptive vocabulary skills, and a composite of parents \u201cshowing up\u201d at school activities was a significant predictor of receptive vocabulary. Lastly, visits to the library significantly predicted children\u2019s Kindergarten letter word identification skills. Implications for parent involvement and future directions for preschool programs are discussed.

One important application of LIBS is the measurement of uranium enrichment (235U/238U), which requires high spectral resolution (e.g., 25 pm for the 424.4 nm U II line). Measuring uranium enrichment is important in the area of nuclear security because the uranium highly enriched in the 235U isotope can be used to construct nuclear weapons. High-resolution dispersive spectrometers necessary for such measurements are typically bulky and expensive. A hybrid interferometric/dispersive spectrometer prototype, which consists of an inexpensive, compact Fabry-Perot etalon integrated with a low to moderate resolution Czerny-Turner spectrometer, was assembled for making high-resolution measurements of nuclear materials in a laboratory setting. To more fully take advantage of this low-cost, compact hybrid spectrometer, a mathematical reconstruction technique was developed to accurately reconstruct relative line strengths from complex spectral patterns with high resolution. Measurement of the mercury 313.1555/313.1844 nm doublet from a mercury-argon lamp yielded a spectral line intensity ratio of 0.682, which agrees well with an independent measurement by an echelle spectrometer and previously reported values.\n\nThe hybrid instrument was used in LIBS measurements and achieved the resolution needed for isotopic selectivity of LIBS of uranium in ambient air. The samples used were a natural uranium foil (0.7% of 235U) and a uranium foil highly enriched in 235U to 93%. Both samples were provided by the Penn State University\u2019s Breazeale Nuclear Reactor. The enrichment of the uranium foils was verified using a high-purity germanium detector and dedicated software for multi-group spectral analysis. Uranium spectral line widths of \u223c10 pm were measured at a center wavelength 424.437 nm, clearly discriminating the natural from the highly enriched uranium at that wavelength. The 424.167 nm isotope shift (\u223c6 pm), limited by spectral broadening, was only partially resolved but still discernible.

In particular, advancement in drug delivery for the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancers is required to increase drug efficacy and improve patient quality of life. Additionally, brighter and more photostable fluorophores are needed to meet demands for improved sensitivity and experimental diversity, which may lead to improvements in early detection of solid tumors and advancement in understanding of biological processes. A literature survey on the state of the field for nanoparticle based biological fluorescence imaging and drug delivery is presented in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 focuses on the characterization techniques used in this work.\nThe development and optical characterization of 20-40 nm diameter, citrate functionalized Cy3 amidite doped calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (Cy3 CPSNPs) for in vitro fluorescence imaging is outlined in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. In particular, sodium citrate was used to functionalize the surface and provide electrosteric dispersion of these particles. CPSNPs stabilized with sodium citrate routinely exhibited highly negative zeta potentials greater than -25 mV in magnitude.  Furthermore, the fluorescence quantum yield of the encapsulated fluorophore was improved by more than 4.5-fold when compared to the unencapsulated dye. The bioimaging and drug delivery capability of CPSNPs was explored. Cy3 CPSNPs dissolved quickly in the acidic environment experienced during endocytosis, releasing the encapsulated fluorophore. This is consistent with solution phase experiments that show the particles are dissolved at pH 5. CPSNPs loaded with fluorescein and a hydrophobic growth inhibitor, ceramide C6, proved the ability to simultaneously image and delivery of the hydrophobic drug to cells in vitro. Despite a focus on only a few fluorophores, the techniques presented are considered generally adaptable for the encapsulation of small organic molecules, including chemotherapeutic drugs and other fluorescent dyes, with relatively modest additional experimental trials and minor adjustments to the synthesis scheme. \nChapter 5 examined the colloidal stability of citrate and polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalized CPSNPs in 70 volume % ethanol/30% water, both experimentally using TEM and theoretically using DLVO and polymeric steric dispersion theories. There are three basic mechanisms for colloidal stability for macroscopic suspensions (i.e., for particulate diameters down to ~100nm), metastable electrostatic in which some finite degree of agglomeration continuously takes place because a finite energy barrier against agglomeration; and electrosteric and steric mechanisms in which infinitely high potential energy barriers toward agglomeration are present leading to thermodynamically stable suspensions.  One of the fundamental issues addressed in this chapter was whether the mechanisms of electrosteric or steric dispersion, based on relatively large adsorbed polyelectrolytes for macroscopic size particulates, scales with particles in the range of ~40 nm diameter such that a small, charged organic molecule such as citrate provides the thermodynamic colloidal stability of electrosteric mechanisms as suggested by preliminary theoretical calculations.  The particle diameter-number distributions for as-prepared and after drying (at 25 \u00b0C) and redispersion were used as metrics for thermodynamic colloidal stability.  How efficiently particles redispersed after drying and reintroduction into the 70:30 ethanol:water solvent was used as the primary metric for whether the metastable electrostatic mechanism or thermodynamically stable electrosteric or steric approaches were responsible for the robust dispersion experimentally observed in the colloids.  These experiments found that, even with the thin electrosteric layer provided by the adsorbed citrate, particles were electrosterically dispersed, and were unagglomerated when dried under argon and redispersed. Some agglomeration was apparent in samples dried under air, however the average agglomeration number, which provides an estimate of the number of primary particles in an agglomerate, was only 5. This suggests that the agglomerates remained small. It is hypothesized that carbon dioxide and the carbonate ion play a role in mediating the agglomeration observed when drying under air. Additionally, PEG functionalized CPSNPs that were dried under argon and under air were unagglomerated. The particles were sterically dispersed in this case because of measured nearly zero zeta potential, but volume restrictions and osmotic forces as well as non-DLVO forces, such as hydrogen bonding networks and solvation forces, play a role in preventing agglomeration and permitting redispersion after drying.\nPreliminary work outlining the synthesis and characterization of silver core, calcium phosphosilicate shell nanoparticles for surface plasmon coupled emission and metal enhanced fluorescence applications is discussed in Chapter 6. Thin (2-5 nm) calcium phosphosilicate shells were formed around agglomerated silver cores in the presence of 8-Methoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (MPTS). Calcium phosphosilicate shells were consistently formed after 72 hours in the presence of 5x10-5 M CaCl2, 3x10-5 M Na2HPO4, 3x10-6 M Na2SiO3, and silver core nanoparticles prepared by citrate reduction in aqueous solution. However, the particles synthesized were agglomerated, resulting in a loss of the plasmon resonance peak, and the shells prepared were not thick enough to provide sufficient separation of the fluorophore from the surface to prevent quenching and allow plasmon resonance enhanced fluorescence. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6283], "author_name_tesi": "Morgan, Thomas Theodore", "last_name_ssi": "Morgan", "middle_name_ssi": "Theodore", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "Tom Mallouk", "James Hansell Adair", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Dissertation Advisor", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Chair", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fluorescence", "Nanoparticle", "Calcium Phosphosilicate", "Bioimaging", "Dispersion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "HAUNTED REGIONS: EXHUMING MARGINALIZED NARRATIVES IN POSTWAR AMERICAN GOTHIC FICTION", "id": "13637jam898", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Haunted Regions: Exhuming Marginalized Narratives in Postwar American Gothic Fiction fills an important void in the ongoing scholarship of Gothic literature.  Traditionally, postwar American Gothic literature has been viewed through a Cold War lens.  Immediately following World War II, the two reigning superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in an ideological stalemate that threatened to result in a nuclear war.  As the story goes, the Cold War generated anxieties in Americans that included fears of Communist invasion, nuclear war, foreign espionage, and the infiltration of Communist values that would undoubtedly result in the destruction of the American way of life.  As a result, this perception has caused scholars to view postwar American Gothic cultural production primarily through a Cold War lens. This Cold War approach has limited Gothic studies to examining invasion films that can be read as allegories for Cold War infiltration and monster films wherein the creatures are the consequence of a nuclear disaster, and therefore much of the Gothic literature produced during the period has been significantly overlooked by scholarship.  Interestingly, much of postwar American Gothic literature exhibits a preoccupation not with the Cold War narrative but with enduring regional and local anxieties.  Among these anxieties include the displacement or extermination of native populations, the heritage of slavery, and the ongoing patriarchal oppression of women.  Therefore, this project aims to demonstrate the persistence of the Gothic in postwar American Literature, distinguish the primarily regional and local character of these texts, and examine how the Gothic is used to exhume regional horrors in the works of William Styron, Shirley Jackson, Ray Bradbury, Chester Himes, and Ross Macdonald.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14233], "author_name_tesi": "Morgart, James Ashley", "last_name_ssi": "Morgart", "middle_name_ssi": "Ashley", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sanford Schwartz", "Sanford Schwartz", "Michael Berube", "Mark Morrisson", "Jonathan Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sanford Schwartz, Dissertation Advisor", "Sanford Schwartz, Committee Chair", "Michael Berube, Committee Member", "Mark Morrisson, Committee Member", "Jonathan Eburne, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gothic", "Regionalism", "American Literature", "Postwar", "The Uncanny", "Abjection", "Gothic Literature", "William Styron", "Chester Himes", "Shirley Jackson", "Ray Bradbury", "Ross Macdonald", "Gothic Science Fiction", "Detective Fiction", "Southern Gothic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Supplementary Tutoring on Students' Mathematics Achievement: A Comparative Study of Japan and the United States", "id": "16256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7909", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supplementary tutoring, also known as shadow education, private tutoring, or out-of-school tutoring, refers to a range of organized tutoring practices in academic subjects that occur outside regular school hours.

In addition to semantic content, speakers imbue their messages with prosodic features comprised of acoustic variations that listeners decode to extract meaning.  Psychological science refers to these acoustic variations as affective prosody. This process of encoding and decoding emotion remains a phenomenon that has yet to be acoustically operationalized.  Studies aimed at sifting and searching for the salience in emotional speech are often limited to conducting new analyses on material generated by other researchers. This project presented an opportunity for analyzing the communication of emotion on a corpus of naturalistic emotional speech generated in collaboration with Penn State\u2019s Psychology Department. To this end, fifty-five participants were recorded speaking the same semantic content in angry, happy, and sad expressive voicings in addition to a neutral tone. Classic parameters were extracted including pitch, loudness, timing, as well as other low-level descriptors (LLDs). The LLDs were compared with published evidence and theory. In general, results were congruent with previous studies for portrayals of more highly aroused emotions like anger and happiness, but less so for sadness. It was determined that a significant portion of the deviations from the scientific consensus could be explained by baseline definitions alone, i.e. whether deviations referenced neutral or emotional LLD values.\n\nA listening study was subsequently conducted in an effort to qualify and contrast the objectively determined effects with perceptual input. Only three of the fifty-five speakers were sampled due to practical concerns for testing time. The study tested whether the sampled recordings reflected naturally recognizable emotion, and the perceived intensity of these emotions.

Such products alter cardiovascular function by their ability to adjust vascular dilation and inhibit platelet aggregation and clotting. A leading hypothesis for mechanotransduction suggests that forces alter the interaction of integrin-based adhesions to extracellular matrix molecules.  Such interactions are expected to be on the time scale of cardiac pulsatility (1-2 Hz). Thus, a greater understanding of the precise magnitude and temporal characteristics of cell adhesion would be instrumental in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of mechanotransduction. Whereas the cell interacts with its environment via the assembly of membrane proteins to form focal adhesions, studies on the early dynamics of force production by optical trapping would lead to a fundamental understanding of mechanotransduction by vascular endothelium. This thesis describes the development, testing, and optimization of protocols and instrumentation for the characterization of integrin-based adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins.  \nOptical trapping allows for application of forces to single molecules and molecular clusters of similar magnitude (~2 pN) to the external forces that these molecules experience in vivo. More importantly for this study, the optical trap is able to detect the exact time that a force is applied to the cell. In order to monitor the activity of adhesion events, a continuous focus drift mechanism with a 100 nanometer-scale sensitivity was developed. This technique measures the changes in distance between the objective and cover slip by measuring the intensity of the light from the epi pathway of the microscope that reflects off of the cover slip.\n\tThe early adhesion dynamics of the cells were studies using both a variance-based and time-to-adhesion-based assay using fibronectin-functionalized beads in contact with the membrane of human aortic endothelial cells.

This dissertation describes the development of a new class of biomimetic polyphosphazenes for use as implantable scaffolds, which were designed to better mimic the chemical and physical properties of bone. Chapter 1 outlines the development, evaluation, and current status of bioerodible polyphosphazenes specifically optimized for biomedical applications.  The polymers were developed because of their ability to sensitize the polymers to hydrolysis to benign small molecules that can be metabolized or excreted from the body.  The largest class of these polymers consists of macromolecules with amino acid ester side groups and these are the main focus of the chapter.  However, a variety of polymers with other side groups also show promise as bioerodible species, and these are mentioned later in the chapter. \nChapter 2 discusses the synthesis of polyphosphazenes containing various vitamin substituents, and their subsequent characterization and hydrolytic instability. The incorporation of biomolecules that stimulate bone growth into a biodegradable polymer scaffold would provide a long term beneficial effect upon hydrolysis. Specifically, vitamins L1, E, and B6 were used because of their biocompatibility, their importance in a variety of biological functions, and their potential to increase the mechanical properties of the resulting polymers, thus making these materials promising candidates for hard tissue engineering scaffolds. Chlorine replacement reactions were carried out initially with the small molecule, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene, as a model for high polymeric, poly(dichlorophosphazene). Due to the steric hindrance generated by vitamin E as a substituent, co-substituted polymers were synthesized with both glycine ethyl ester or sodium ethoxide as the second substituent. Similarly, vitamin B6 was co-substituted with glycine ethyl ester or phenylalanine ethyl ester to favor biodegradability. To prevent crosslinking via multifunctional reagents, the hydroxyl groups in vitamin B6 were protected and subsequently deprotected under acidic conditions after side group linkage to the polymer backbone. The glass transition temperatures of the polymers ranged from -24.0 to 44.0 \u00b0C. Hydrolysis of the polymers in de-ionized water at 37 \u00b0C was used as an initial estimate of their hydrolytic sensitivity. Different solid polymers underwent 10 % to 100 % weight loss in six weeks with the generation of a broad pH range of ~2.5 to 9. The weight loss during preliminary hydrolysis experiments was attributed to cleavage of the polymer backbone and/or the polymers becoming soluble in the aqueous media during hydrolytic reactions. These polymers were not further explored for use as hard tissue grafts because of their fast hydrolysis profiles.   \nTo address this issue, chapter 3 discusses the synthesis of polyphosphazenes containing the antioxidant, ferulic acid, and amino acid esters as co-substituents. The synthesis protocol utilized the replacement of chlorine atoms in poly(dichlorophosphazene) by ferulic acid with either glycine, alanine, valine, or phenylalanine ethyl ester. Ferulic acid protects cells from free radical damage, and its steric characteristics have the potential to generate polymeric materials with high mechanical strength for hard tissue engineering scaffolds. Incorporation of the amino acid esters allows for control over the polymer hydrolysis while releasing the antioxidant at different rates. Macromolecular substitution reactions were carried out utilizing the allyl ester of ferulic acid to prevent side reactions during halogen replacement. The allyl protecting group was then removed using mild conditions. The polymers were characterized by 1H, 31P, GPC, and DSC techniques. Static water contact angles were measured to monitor the change in hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. Before deprotection, the water contact angles were 82 \u2013 88 \u00b0 and after deprotection the water contact angles were 56 \u2013 71 \u00b0. A pH-dependent hydrolysis study revealed that the polymers are hydrolytically sensitive and decomposed ~ 5 \u2013 25 % over 8 weeks yielding a final pH between 6.0 \u2013 6.5. Polymer hydrolysis resulted in the release of ferulic acid. The polymers were photocrosslinked by a [2+2] cycloaddition of the ferulic acid moieties induced by exposure to long-wave UV light. The crosslinking was monitored by UV-spectroscopy via the apparent decrease in the 320 nm absorbance, attributed to the cyclization of the ferulic acid moieties. Increased UV exposure time led to an increase in the level of crosslinking. After 60 seconds, the polymers were crosslinked ~ 41 \u2013 62 %. Hydrolysis experiments of the crosslinked materials showed only a 0 \u2013 5 % weight loss after 8 weeks with a pH between 6.6 \u2013 7.0.\nIn order for the polymers to be used as a synthetic bone graft they should promote the natural mineralization process of hydroxyapatite (HAp). Chapter 4 describes the mineralization behavior of the antioxidant containing polyphosphazenes when exposed to a solution of simulated body fluid (SBF). All polymers contained ferulic acid (antioxidant), co \u2013 substituted with different amino acid esters linked to the polyphosphazene backbone. Differences in the side groups determined the hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of the resulting polymers. All the polymers mineralized monocalcium phosphate monohydrate (MCPM), a type of biological apatite. However, the mineralization process (amount of deposition and length of time) was dependent on the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the polymers. The polymer-apatite composites were examined by electron scanning microscopy (ESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravametric analysis (TGA). Weight gain data were also obtained. To verify that the nucleation process was due to the presence of calcium and phosphate, two standard solutions were prepared: one solution (NaCl Solution) contained only sodium chloride and the second solution (mSBF) was similar to SBF except without known crystal \u2013 growth inhibitors such as Mg2+ and HCO3-. No mineralization occurred when the polymers were exposed to the NaCl Solution, but mineralization took place when exposed to mSBF. The apatite phase produced was hydroxyapatite (HAp). The mineralization process in mSBF was much more extensive, with all samples gaining more weight than when exposed to SBF. A similar trend was also found (as in the case of SBF), with the amount of deposition and length of deposition time depending on the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the polymer. These results suggest that the nucleation process is due to calcium and phosphate, and the absence of crystal growth inhibitors allows for the rapid nucleation of HAp. In both cases, the mineralization process was favored on hydrophilic surfaces (static water contact angle of 56\u201365\u00b0) versus hydrophobic surfaces (71\u201386\u00b0). These polymers are currently being tested for their osteocompatibility.\nChapter 5 discusses the synthesis of phosphonate [PO(OEt2)] and phosphonic acid [PO(OH)2] containing polyphosphazenes because of their ability to bind hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2], which comprises 70 wt% of bone. These polymers could mimic the natural bone healing mechanism, making them excellent candidates for implantable bone grafts. Two synthetic protocols have been developed to obtain the polymers, herein referred to as prior- and post-side group assembly. Prior-assembly required the synthesis of a phosphonate-containing side group before attachment to the polyphosphazene backbone through nucleophilic substitution, whereas post-assembly required the synthesis of a polyphosphazene containing free amino groups to which the phosphonate can be coupled by Michael addition after polymer synthesis. The final step for both routes required the deprotection of the phosphoester to the corresponding phosphonic acid. The polymers were characterized by 1H and 31P NMR, GPC, and DSC techniques. A six week hydrolysis study using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) determined their hydrolytic sensitivity. All the polymers were hydrolytically sensitive, as required for this purpose, and decomposed ~ 2 \u2013 50 % by week six. The hydrolysis products were analyzed by UV-Vis techniques and their release was monitored over the course of the experiment. These results are in agreement with percent solid mass loss data. In general, all the phosphonic acid polymers hydrolyzed at a faster rate than their corresponding phosphoester derivatives. \nChapter 6 discusses the mineralization potential of phosphoester and phosphonic acid containing polyphosphazenes during exposure to a solution of simulated body fluid (SBF) for a period of four weeks.  Although all the polymers showed an initial mineralization response, the amount of deposition and the time scale, were dependent on the side group chemistry of the polymers. After exposure to SBF for one week, all the polymers mineralized HAp. After three weeks in SBF, polymers containing phosphoester substituents showed no significant change, with a weight gain of < 1 %, while polymers containing phosphonic acid substituents underwent a significant increase in the amount of mineralized HAp, with weight gains between 5 - 10 %. The morphology of mineralized features was observed with Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM). However, due to the structural complexity of the mineralized polymers, the identity of the mineralized phase could not be definitively identified using traditional characterization techniques such as energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), or X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), a technique not previously explored for this type of application, successfully reveals details of the chemistry associated with the mineralized phase.\nThe remaining chapters discuss the synthesis and fabrication of injectable scaffolds for hard tissue engineering. Specifically, chapter 7 discusses the bioerodible behavior of polyphosphazenes containing serine and threonine amino acids, which contain two different functional points of attachment to a phosphazene backbone (N- and O-terminus), were synthesized using an improved technique and their hydrolysis behavior was investigated. In the aqueous media the solid polymers yield hydrolysis products phosphate, ammonia, and the amino acid, and ethanol, and have the potential to be used in several different biomedical applications, ultimately determined by their hydrolysis behavior. A pH- dependent hydrolysis study revealed that all the polymers are hydrolytically sensitive, regardless of the type of linkage to the polyphosphazene backbone, although the hydrolysis rates are different. Polymers with amino acid esters linked through the N-terminus hydrolyzed between 16 and 60 % within a six week period. This is the fastest reported hydrolysis of any amino acid ester substituted polyphosphazene. The mechanism of hydrolysis is by bulk erosion as monitored by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). Polymers with the amino acid units linked through the O-terminus are soluble in water; thus their percent weight loss in aqueous media could not be determined. However, 31P NMR spectroscopy confirmed their hydrolytic sensitivity and the formation of phosphates and oligomeric species, which increased during the six week hydrolysis period. Complete hydrolysis did not occur within six weeks. The O-linked species are under investigation to use as injectable hydrogel scaffolds. \nChapter 8 discusses the synthesis and characterization of amino-containing polyphosphazenes and the development of novel injectable hydrogel systems based on the Schiff base reaction between the amino-polyphosphazenes and aldehyded-dextran polymers. The amino-polyphosphaznes were characterized by several methods including 1H NMR, 31P NMR, solid state 13C NMR, GPC, and DSC techniques. The aldehyded-dextran polymers were characterized by solid state 13C NMR, FTIR, and their aldehyde content was determined by titration. After physical mixing of the two components at room temperature and physiological pH, different gelation times were observed. The gelation time was found to be dependent on the percent of oxidized dextran, the higher the oxidation percentage, the faster the gelation time. The hydrogel properties were evaluated using rheology, themal characterization, and microscopy. Hydrogels with low- and high-crosslink density were observed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8582], "author_name_tesi": "Morozowich, Nicole Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Morozowich", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "James Patrick Runt", "Benjamin James Lear", "Raymond Edward Schaak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polyphosphazne", "Bioerodible", "Biomimetic", "Hard Tissue Engineering", "Vitamin", "Antioxidant", "Hydroxyapatite", "Hydrogel", "ToF-SIMS"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MITIGATING NITROGEN POLLUTION BY INTERSEEDING COVER CROPS INTO SPELT", "id": "13839ajm6718", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13839", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Agricultural intensification has increased the production capacity of agroecosystems by using soluble nitrogen (N) to fertilize crops. However, N saturation produces negative impacts for terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric ecosystems. Ecological nutrient management is an approach to agricultural production with the goal of tightening nutrient cycles by increasing the residence time of nutrients. This strategy entails maximizing the timing and diversity of plant cover, minimizing tillage, and using organic sources of nutrients. Cover crop interseeding is an old practice that could achieve nutrient reduction goals by employing cover crops and reduced tillage to improve nitrogen retention and provisioning. However, cover crops are used on only a small fraction of cropland in the United States. As a result, more research is needed to understand the impact of cover crop interseeding and to expand cover crop adoption. To assess cover crop interseeding, we established a cropping systems experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA. This experiment utilized legume-grass cover crop bicultures no-till interseeded under a spelt crop contrasted with similar cover crops planted post-harvest with tillage. Biogeochemical approaches were used to measure agroecosystem N pools and to estimate N fluxes such as N fixation, nitrate leaching, and nitrous oxide emissions.\n\tWe found that reduced tillage in the interseeded systems maintained smaller soil inorganic N pools (<5 mg N/kg soil) than the tilled systems (p < 0.001). This was associated with a significant 50% decrease in cumulative nitrous oxide emissions during the fall (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in potentially leachable nitrate over the winter despite minimal fall soil nitrate availability in the interseeded systems (p = 0.086). Significantly lower spring cover crop biomass N in the interseeded systems (p = 0.022) may indicate increased susceptibility for spring nitrate leaching. One piece of evidence for this conclusion is that the \u03b415N of the interseeded legume in the spring shifted closer to the grass \u03b415N, which suggests the legume N is being mineralized and taken up by the grass. If legume N is being released in this way, it may also be lost through leaching. Spelt yields were not significantly different between the four systems from which we conclude that the interseeded cover crops did not compete with the spelt. In addition, a forage cutting was taken from the interseeded cover crops in the fall providing an additional source of income to the farmer. Spring cover crop biomass N in all systems provides a N credit to the following cash crop, though this was significantly lower in the interseeded systems (p = 0.022). Nitrogen removed in the forage cutting may have contributed to a decreased ability for the interseeded cover crop to provide N to the following cash crop.  \n\tThese results suggest that no-till interseeded cover crops could mitigate the climate impact of agriculture by minimizing nitrous oxide emissions. However, interseeding did not improve nitrate leaching or N provisioning, which suggests that different cover crop species should be selected for these management goals. More research is necessary to optimize these cropping systems for a variety of outcomes. Overall this research illustrates that ecological nutrient management using strategies like no-till cover crop interseeding may be an effective approach to tightening nutrient cycles in agroecosystems.

All sites contained a tangent section with a steep grade (greater than 4 percent) that progressed into a sharp horizontal curve.\nMean speed prediction models were developed using an ordinary least squares (OLS) modeling approach. Separate models were developed for the approach tangent and the point of curvature (PC) of the horizontal curve.

These results imply that teacher education programs will need to turn toward a preparation that is based on a view of L2 education as complex and socially negotiated with the understanding that teachers are legitimate knowers who must grapple with the complex demands of the classroom using their own experiential knowledge in a reflexive relation with theory to determine how best to teach within their own classroom contexts.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1786], "author_name_tesi": "Morrison, Elizabeth Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Morrison", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson", "Karen E Johnson", "Jacqueline Edmondson", "Paula Golombek", "Athelstan Canagarajah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen E Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member", "Paula Golombek, Committee Member", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["discourse analysis", "critical ethnography", "ESL", "learner-centeredness", "classroom practice", "student differences"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Local-global principles and diophantine sets in rings of number-theoretic interest", "id": "15310txm950", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15310", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hilbert's tenth problem over a number field, a major open\nproblem, concerns\nthe decidability of the diophantine subsets of that number field.

In that time the technologies have changed so rapidly that sequencing has been surpassing Moore\u2019s Law in that sequencing capacity has been doubling in less than the 18 month pace at which computing power has been doubling since the late 1950s.  This prodigious increase in the ability to sequence DNA fragments coupled with the precipitous drop in price has lead to an explosion of the number and type of biological experiments possible.  In the ten years since the mouse genome was first sequenced we have gone from being able to detect sequence feature like open reading frames, to being able to compare multiple species revealing differing patterns of evolutionary constraint, to being able to determine the genomic distribution of a whole host of epigenetic features such as histone modifications and DNA bound transcription factors, to being able to sequence cDNA reflections of transcripts.\nIn this dissertation I lay out a strategy for efficiently analyzing and interpreting the mountains of data resulting from modern sequencing experiments.  I discuss the software tools used to process sequencing data, and touch on the important runtime parameters.  I provide uniform analysis workflows for transcription factor and histone modification ChIP-seq experiments which I have personally used to process data from 55 sequencing experiments.  I go on to discuss some of the potential pitfalls that should be avoided, and I provide a blacklist that can be used to filter artifacts from ChIP-seq results.\nWhen a transcription factor ChIP-seq experiment is performed, the desired product is a list of genomic locations bound by the transcription factor of interest.  To obtain this list, we turn to peak-calling software that interprets the pileup of sequencing reads to determine peak locations.  Unfortunately the resulting peaks are very dependent on the peak-calling threshold and other parameters not all of which are well understood.  I explore the inherent reproducibility of peak calling in ChIP-seq experiments, and through a combination of sub-sampling and vote counting strive to improve our understanding of peak quality and reproducibility.\nFinally, I integrate the fruits of my sequencing analysis to illuminate the epigenetics of erythroid differentiation.  The Hardison lab utilizes the G1E(Weiss, Yu, & Orkin, 1997) cell line as a model of murine erythropoeisis.  G1E cells are an erythroid committed Gata1 knockout cell line derived from mouse embryonic stem cells.  GATA1 is a master regulator for erythropoeisis, and without it the G1E cells are stuck in a self renewing erythroid progenitor stage.  G1E-ER4 is a GATA1 rescue subline of G1E in which GATA1 can be induced, and differentiation toward erythrocytes can be restored.  This is a beautiful system for studying the cascade of differential processes set in motion by the action of this master regulator.  Here I use DNase-seq to identify an unprecedentedly comprehensive set of regulatory genomic regions active during erythroid differentiation.  Through the integration of transcription factor binding locations, histone modifications, and gene expression data, I annotate the regulatory regions as being likely promoters, insulators, enhancers, or other cis-regulatory modules.  I show that there are surprisingly few changes in the chromatin landscape and DNA accessibility throughout differentiation despite dramatic changes in expression of thousands of genes.  This lack of landscape rearrangements seen during differentiation points to the extent to which the epigenome has been prepared for differentiation prior to the effects of the master regulator GATA1.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9195], "author_name_tesi": "Morrissey, Chris S", "last_name_ssi": "Morrissey", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Chris", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Webb Colby Miller", "Michael Axtell", "Qunhua Li", "David John Vandenbergh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Chair", "Michael Axtell, Committee Member", "Qunhua Li, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Epigenetic gene regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Computational Study of the Dissolution of Aluminosilicate Minerals\n\n", "id": "9077", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1187", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe reactions of aluminosilicate clusters with water are investigated using ab-initio calculations.

When combined with integrated circuits, consumers could be given direct access to these sensors. As a result,consumers could use these sensors as monitoring devices allowing people to take a more pro-active approach to their health. This fabrication method consisted of functionalizing nanowires synthesized off-chip, then positioning them to predetermined locations and integrating them with features already patterned on a chip surface. Because silicon nanowires used in FET and NEMS sensors are difficult to fabricate in high yield, the SiO<sub>2</sub> coated metal nanowires used to develop this fabrication method, were used only to mimic the native oxide that forms on Si nanowires allowing us to use the same binding chemistry on the nanowire mimics as on Si nanowires. Chapter 2 describes the positioning process and examines the selectivity of the probe DNA to fluorescently labeled target sequences following exposure to non-uniform electric fields, which were required to position the nanowires. In addition, treatments were performed on the biofunctionalized nanowires to mimic the lithographic steps the nanowires must endure when being integrated with chip electronics. These treatments included coating the nanowires with a photoresist, submerging them in a photoresist remover, and combining the two processes. Selectivity of the probe DNA for binding a fully complementary oligonucleotide as compared to a non-complementary sequence was examined following these treatments. We determined that following both the exposure to non-uniform electric fields and the lithographic treatments, the probe DNA selectively hybridized to completely complementary versus non-complementary fluorescently labeled DNA target sequences.  By positioning multiple batches of nanowires each functionalized with a different single stranded probe DNA sequence to specific locations on the chip, the sensors would be more able to simultaneously detect multiple target analytes, reducing the need for high sample volumes while decreasing the time for diagnosis of diseases. In Chapter 3 this fabrication method was expanded upon by delivering three different batches of probe-functionalized nanowires to predetermined electrode gaps using the non-uniform electric field method described in Chapter 2. In addition, microwells patterned halfway into a photoresist dielectric were used to further position the nanowires along the electrode gaps. These microwells enabled uniform spacing between the nanowires and also permitted the use of the lithographic techniques described in Chapter 2. These lithographic steps were used to fabricate contacts over one end of the positioned nanowires forming singly clamped NEMS-like structures, or over both ends of the nanowires forming FET-like devices, while also integrating them in registration with features already patterned on the chip surface. Positioning and selectivity of the biofunctionalized nanowires was verified using three different DNA targets each labeled with a different fluorescent dye. Chapter 4 describes experiments performed adapting this fabrication method to develop FET-like structures. FETs are attractive as biosensors for their label-free, realtime responses to target analyte binding; high sensitivities in desalted solutions; and their electrical readout, which make them desirable candidates for incorporation with integrated circuits. To accomplish this, a number of changes were made to the fabrication method. These included patterning dual contacts over both ends of the nanowires forming source and drain electrodes, unlike the singly clamped NEMS-like structures described in Chapter 3. In addition, electrical isolation of the nanowires is required to avoid cross-talk between multiple sensing elements. In order to accomplish this, a second lithography step was used to pattern lines around the positioned nanowires. While the biofunctionalized nanowires were protected under a photoresist layer, Cl<sub>2</sub> plasma was used to etch the Au alignment electrodes in these lines. Treatments mimicking these added steps included coating the nanowires with a new photoresist and removing it with the photoresist remover used in Chapters 2 and 3. This new photoresist, Megaposit SPR 3012, was different from that used in the experiments described in Chapters 2 and 3. This new photoresist was required for the new instrument used in the process, the GCA 8000 stepper, which aided in greater accuracy and precision during the photolithographic steps. A second round of treatment with the photoresist and the remover mimicked the second lithography step needed for line patterning. To mimic the Au etch of the alignment electrodes, following the first round of treatments with the photoresist and remover, photoresist was applied a second time, then exposed to the Cl<sub>2</sub> plasma, then submerged in the photoresist remover. After it was determined that the individual steps do not adversely affect the probe DNA, FET-like devices were fabricated using biofunctionalized/SiO<sub>2</sub> coated nanowires. Selectivity of the biofunctionalized nanowires was determined by incubating the devices with target- and fluorescently-labeled tag DNA. When Au was used as the nanowire, high fluorescence intensities were observed on the assembled devices. In addition to the FET-like devices described in Chapter 4, we were also interested in developing NEMS devices for DNA/RNA biomarker detection. Chapter 5 describes the experiments performed to direct hybridization of target DNA and DNA Au conjugates to the tip of Rh nanowires. Rh nanowires have been shown to have excellent mechanical properties when used as cantilevers. The added mass at the tip of the cantilevers would have the greatest effect on the resonating properties. Au/Rh/Au multisegmented nanowires were fabricated and functionalized with probe DNA, and Au conjugates were used to verify the selective hybridization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the Au conjugates primarily bound to the Au segments of the nanowires. Probe coverage experiments performed on separate Au and Rh nanowires suggested that the thiolated probe was binding to both metals, but that the DNA bound to the Rh segments was less available for hybridization possibly due to multiple point attachment. The fabrication methods described in Chapters 2 through 4 show that a combination of top-down and bottom-up techniques can be used to fabricate biosensing structures such as bioFETs and NEMS, which can eventually be combined with integrated circuits. Beyond the scope of solely biosensing, this method holds the promise of integrating a variety of materials such as III-V semiconductors and graphene that in turn may revolutionize the semiconducting industry. In this work, we show that nanomaterials, specifically biofunctionalized nanowires, are attractive candidates as sensing elements in chip-based biosensors because of their unique optical, electrical, and chemical properties, in addition to their high surface-to-volume ratio. More importantly, the results described in Chapters 2 through 5 show that nanowires can be manipulated to develop these sensors and that they may be combined with integrated circuits.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6187], "author_name_tesi": "Morrow, Thomas J", "last_name_ssi": "Morrow", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Philip C.

Colloidal synthesis employs solubilized chemical precursors to build materials from the bottom-up, providing an attractive method for generating nanoscale materials with extraordinary levels of control over material dimensions and morphology. In addition to the range of tunable synthetic parameters, colloidal syntheses offer solution dispersible nanoscale solids, which allows for convenient and high throughput liquid phase processing of the desired materials.\n\nUnder the appropriate synthetic conditions, colloidally dispersed nanoparticle seeds can be used as structural foundations to nucleate and grow new material domains. Through this strategy, nanoparticles consisting of chemically distinct materials connected through solid state interfaces can be accessed. Dubbed \u201chybrid nanoparticles\u201d, these materials constitute an expanding class of multi-component nanostructures that can exhibit multifunctionality as well as emergent phenomena not observed for the constituent materials independently. Moreover, these hybrids can adopt structures that expose multiple material domains to the surrounding media, allowing for additional synergies to be realized due to the distinct chemical surfaces arranged in close proximity. The unique features offered by these hierarchal nanostructures underpin, among many others, advanced applications in photovoltaics, biomedical theranostics, catalysis and chemical sensing.\n\nAlthough colloidal hybrid nanoparticles are attractive for a variety of applications, there are still significant hurdles that impair their widespread use. For example, the complex pathways that govern the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of these materials are not well understood, and accordingly, a robust synthetic framework for the modular design of hybrid structures from a diverse library of material combinations and connectivities has yet to be developed. In addition, current synthetic protocols for known colloidal hybrid architectures are nontrivial to execute, with run-to-run variability commonly observed among the product particle populations. For these reasons, studies that provide fundamental insights into colloidal reaction pathways, or offer robust strategies to access these materials in high quality, will enable key advancements in the future design and application of hybrid nanoparticle systems.\n\nIn this dissertation, I present several contributions focusing on various aspects of inorganic colloidal nanoparticle chemistry. These contributions include chapters describing rigorous synthetic details as well as insights into the mechanistic pathways that govern the outcome of colloidal hybrid nanoparticle syntheses. Specifically, these studies center on the well known heterotrimer nanoparticle systems Ag-Pt-Fe3O4 and Au-Pt-Fe3O4, using them as model systems to provide generalizable insights into hybrid nanoparticle design and synthesis. In a subsequent chapter of this work, I describe new developments in the colloidal nanoparticle purification technique differential magnetic catch and release. This chapter demonstrates an alternative strategy to accessing predictable and high quality colloidal structures, by focusing on post synthetic purification rather than judicious synthetic control. Finally, an additional chapter of this dissertation describes a study investigating the selective hydrogenation of functionalized nitroarenes. These selective transformations typically require the application of complex nanoscale catalysts, which have complementary chemical surfaces in close proximity that are capable of cooperatively activating distinct reagent functionalities. The structural commonalities between heterostructured hybrid nanoparticles and these catalytic systems motivated us to investigate these transformations further and resulted in the unexpected discovery of bulk iron pyrite (FeS2) as an effective catalyst for these transformations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14704], "author_name_tesi": "Morse, James R", "last_name_ssi": "Morse", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Siyang Zheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoparticles", "Nanoparticle purification", "Colloidal Synthesis", "pyrite", "selective hydrogenation", "heterostructure", "hybrid nanoparticles"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Ligand-directed Functional Selectivity at the Opioid Receptor Family: An Epic Approach to Understanding Opioid Receptor Signaling", "id": "12691", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4096", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Opioid receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated by opioid ligands. These ligands offer powerful medical benefits due to their analgesic properties, but activation of opioid receptors can also lead to many negative side effects, including tolerance and dependence.  Conventional theory ascribes most of the analgesic and addictive effects of opioids to the activation of the mu opioid receptor subtype (MOR). However, it has recently been suggested that the other classic opioid receptors, the delta opioid receptor (DOR) and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), may also contribute important functionality. We hypothesize that all of the classic opioid receptors play a vital role in understanding the full functionality of the opioid signaling system. Directed drug design is the future of therapeutic development, and in order to be capable of creating targeted opioid analgesics, we must be able to break down the signaling pathway. \nUsing dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assays and biosensor technology, we characterized all three classic opioid receptors using a library of known opioid ligands. We also studied the roles of cellular context in opioid receptor signaling by characterizing the endogenous population of opioid receptors found in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Utilizing 13 different assay formats, this technology allowed us to examine receptor specificity, G-protein coupling, and downstream pathway selectivity. It has been suggested in the literature that ligand-directed functional selectivity provides a sufficient basis for understanding GPCR activity and molding the future of drug design. We hypothesize that the use of biosensor high throughput technology presents a viable opportunity to fully decipher the complexities of the opioid signaling cascade. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4074], "author_name_tesi": "Morse, Megan ", "last_name_ssi": "Morse", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Patricia Grigson", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member", "Patricia Grigson, Committee Member", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GPCR", "Opioid", "Receptor SIgnaling", "DMR"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Positive Emotion, Drinking Motivation, and Problematic Drinking: A Case for Cultural Variations", "id": "23623", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10797", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emotions have frequently been established as antecedents or correlates of maladaptive substance use.

These color changes arise from the oscillations of electrons on the surface of the metal, or surface plasmons. The interactions between plasmonic nanoparticles and molecules are of great interest because they are responsible for many useful phenomena, such as plasmon-exciton hybridization and surface enhanced spectroscopy. Plasmon-molecule interactions are very detailed in nature, and often result from interference between the electric fields of both systems and from overlap between the wavefunction of the metal and of the molecule. Because of these complex interactions, it is important to develop theoretical tools to help to simulate and understand these systems. One particularly exciting area of research in plasmon-molecule interactions is surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) because it is both sensitive and selective, making it applicable for use in detection devices and biological monitoring. In SERS, the  enhancement that arises from the strong local electric field of the plasmon is called the electromagnetic mechanism, and the enhancement that arises from wavefunction overlap is called the chemical mechanism. We have developed a model that allows us to understand the origin of non-resonant chemical mechanism of SERS. We have found that the magnitude of this enhancement mechanism is governed to a large extent by the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the metal and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the molecule. This implies that molecules that readily accept pi-backbonding are likely to have a strong chemical enhancement.  This model provides a framework for designing new molecules which exhibit high chemical enhancements. We have also developed a new method that aids in simulating and understanding metal nanoparticle-molecule interactions.  This method, which we have called the discrete interaction model/quantum mechanics (DIM/QM) method, simulates the nanoparticle classically as a collection of polarizable atoms while retaining an electronic structure description of the adsorbed molecule.  This allows us to model how a plasmon interacts with a molecule, and how the electronic structure of the molecule responds to the nanoparticle.  With the DIM/QM method, we have found that the response of molecules is very dependent on the local environment on the surface of the nanoparticle.  Further, we have found that the magnitude and very nature of the response is dependent on the relative orientation of the molecule. This has important ramifications in designing surface enhanced spectroscopy substrates. We demonstrate that DIM is capable of modeling very large nanoparticles (> 1,000,000 atoms or 40 nm diameter).  It is now possible to simulate and understand complex phenomena such as plasmon-exciton hybridization and single-molecule SERS.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7492], "author_name_tesi": "Morton, Seth Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Morton", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Seth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen", "David Lawrence Allara", "John B Asbury", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["surface enhanced", "Raman", "spectroscopy", "electronic structure", "hybridization", "theory", "plasmonics", "plasmon", "nanoparticle", "electrodynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A Case Study of a Family Based Intervention for Introducing Sustainable Agriculture into Limited-Income Communities\n\n", "id": "11867", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overall intent of this study was to learn about effective ways to construct and deliver community gardening/ sustainable agriculture educational programs in limited-income communities.

A total of 27 youth and adults participated in a six-week summer program, Families Reinforcing Environmentally Sustainable Habits (FRESH). Eight youth were administered pre- and post-quizzes to determine changes in knowledge and attitude with regard to sustainable agriculture, local food systems and nutrition. Four adults were administered a retrospective design survey at the end of the program to measure changes in knowledge, attitude, and behavior. Four weeks after the end of the program, two of the adults who filled out a retrospective design survey were given a follow-up survey to measure sustained change in behavior over time. Due to the expected small sample size, the primary investigator and a research assistant took observational notes throughout the implementation of the program to complement the survey and quiz result data. Results from the survey did not indicate any program impact on adult participants\u2019 knowledge about health and nutrition, food systems and the environment, but did show an increase in attitudes and behaviors related to these general topics. There was some pre- to post- program change in the youth quiz results for questions pertaining to knowledge about food systems and the environment, but overall there was little change in knowledge and attitudes. Positive program-related changes were found in adult participants\u2019 attitudes and behaviors towards health and nutrition, food systems and the environment, and gardening, and in youth attitudes and behaviors towards gardening.

For all ligands, we discuss differences in the obtained thermodynamic parameters (K, \u0394G, \u0394H, and \u0394S) and differences in binding modes with the Pd center. For bulky ligands and poor electron donating ligands (monodentate), only one equivalent of ligand was able to bind to the Pd center.

Strong electron donating solvents such as pyridine coordinated to the Pd center and allowed only one equivalent of ligand to bind.

We characterize the resulting Rh species in each solvent using 31P NMR spectroscopy and solution calorimetry in order to determine possible changes in the active Rh structure and test each solvent system for its activity toward the hydrogenation of 1-heptene and 1-octene in a differential batch reactor at 0\u00b0C. We interpret the kinetic results (i.e. turnover frequencies) in terms of the Rh species present in each solvent as well as the electron donating and accepting properties of each solvent. Strong electron donating solvents such as pyridine inhibited the hydrogenation reactions due to coordination to the Rh centers.\n\tWe transition to studying homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic results for Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst and a series of supported analogs. First, we graft different functional groups (primary amines, secondary amines, and diphenylphosphines) onto SBA-15 silica surfaces. We then immobilize Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst on each of the three types of functionalized SBA-15 and rigorously characterize each supported Rh species using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, most notably 2D 31P{1H} HETCOR (heteronuclear correlation) NMR. Using these spectroscopic results, we propose structures for the most likely surface Rh species. When used for hydrothiolation reactions, these catalysts exhibit switches in stereoselectivity (though retaining high regioselectivity for the anti-Markovnikov product) based on the type of functional group (and, therefore, the local Rh structure). Conversely, for hydrosulfonation, all three supported Rh catalysts are regioselective in favor of the Markovnikov product. We then focus on the phosphine-functionalized SBA-15 silica as a control surface in order to examine the effect of the nature of the grafting solvent on the resulting grafted Rh species. We compare the homogeneous activity and selectivity of Wilkinson\u2019s catalyst in each grafting solvent (acting as the reaction solvent) for the hydrothiolation of phenylacetylene by thiophenol as a model reaction to the heterogeneous activity and selectivity of each supported Rh catalyst (grafted in each of the different solvents). We found solvents that were highly active for homogeneous hydrothiolation (e.g. THF) produced heterogeneous Rh catalysts that were barely active and poorly selective when used as grafting solvents. We also observed solvents that were not as active for homogeneous hydrothiolation (e.g. toluene, DCE), yet produced highly active, regio- and stereoselective catalysts when used as grafting solvents.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8339], "author_name_tesi": "Moschetta, Eric Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Moschetta", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Michael John Janik", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop, Committee Member", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heterogeneous catalysis", "homogeneous catalysis", "calorimetry", "thermodynamics", "solvent effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Iron Age Canaan: Regional Trends in Animal Economy", "id": "27481", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11200", "abstract_tesi": "The Late Bronze Age is often described as an age of internationalism characterized by well-developed political and commercial contacts facilitated by empires and regional imperialism. The end of the Late Bronze Age during the final decades of the 13th century B.C.E. witnessed crises, collapse, and the decline of this world system and imperial aspirations. This upheaval changed the political and economic landscape of the southern Levant, resulting in fragmentation and regionalism that characterizes the 12th and 11th centuries B.C.E. of the early Iron Age. The political environment became increasingly structured with the rise of territorial states during the Iron IIA and the eventual reintegration into an imperial system during the Iron IIC.

This statistic begs the question of how, in an era of a global economy, rapid advances in communication and computing technology, and increased rates of literacy and education, can such a large portion of the world\u2019s population still be plagued by the basic problem of housing? This thesis suggests that this reality is often the unintentional but inevitable outcome of traditional design thinking models that fail to acknowledge basic principles of the concept of sustainable development. Brought forth as a concept on which to base needed changes in global policy by the Brundtland Report in 1987, sustainable development is changing the way we look at the critical issues of the modern world. William McDonough, architect and advocate for sustainable development, has stated that all models and phases of design require rethinking. He suggests the traditional linear process, a cradle-to-grave paradigm of a design process resulting in an end product should be exchanged for a cyclical, or cradle-to-cradle process that considers the subsequent use and future adaptations of the products of design.\n\nIn 2004, the National Architectural Accreditation Board made sustainable design an official criteria of the conditions for accreditation, but examination of this criteria\u2019s definition indicates a manifestation of sustainable development that tries to fit within traditional design thinking models rather than creating new ones. In particular, the definition omits social and economic issues, which are critical to the understanding of sustainable development as encompassing the three interdependent areas of social and economic development and environmental protection. Humanitarian design is the essential architectural discipline that engages social and economic issues, and therefore principles of humanitarian design need to be adopted into architectural discourse in order to realize a complete model for sustainable development. Through the mechanism of a case study, this research therefore examines correlations between architectural curriculum criteria and essential factors to humanitarian design, gathering a body of knowledge on which to inform further development of curriculum models that respond to the interdependent and dynamic qualities of the world\u2019s developing environments. The suggested models embody feet-on-the-ground methods that are manifested in collaborative projects that emphasize extended interaction of designers with local communities and environments, and present a paradigm shift from a linear and individually based design process to one that recognizes the greater community, social and environmental responsibilities of the profession. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1539], "author_name_tesi": "Mosemann, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Mosemann", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darla V Lindberg", "Darla V Lindberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor", "Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["collaborative design", "design thinking", "sustainable development", "humanitarian design", "architectural education", "socially conscious design", "design build"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "RELIABILITY STUDIES OF LOW-VOLTAGE, PLANAR, POWER MOSFET DEVICES", "id": "10592", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semiconductor transistors have been utilized in digital electronics for many years now as switches in logic circuits.

It aims to disrupt hierarchies of knowledge that relegate Pacific island cities to the periphery and, instead, position Honolulu\u2019s architectural heritage within global conversations about identity, politics, and culture.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11324], "author_name_tesi": "Moses, Kelema Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Moses", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Kelema", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Robert Zabel", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Madhuri Shrikant Desai", "Deryck William Holdsworth", "Dr Stacy Kamehiro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Robert Zabel, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Committee Member", "Madhuri Shrikant Desai, Committee Member", "Deryck William Holdsworth, Committee Member", "Dr Stacy Kamehiro, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hawaii", "architecture", "urbanism", "colonialism", "nationalism", "regionalism", "internationalism", "politics", "identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Role of hydroxycinnamic acids on the generation of Maillard-type aroma compounds in whole grain wheat bread", "id": "15791", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7992", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The non-enzymatic reaction between sugars and amino acids, also known as the Maillard reaction, affects many aspects of food quality, including color, taste and aroma formation, nutritional value, and toxicity.  While many parameters such as pH, temperature, and water activity/content can affect compounds formed by the Maillard reaction, the effect of phenolic compounds is a relatively recent discovery.  Specifically, one class of phenolic compounds, hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs), the predominant type of phenolic compounds in wheat, were further studied to determine their effects on aroma production in various bread model systems using gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS), liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and sensory techniques.\n\nSimple aqueous Maillard model systems were conducted to study the reactivity of HCAs on aroma development. The addition of HCAs to carbonyl-amine Maillard reaction systems showed a suppression in the formation of several key Maillard aroma compounds, such as various pyrazines (pyrazine, methylpyrazine, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine), 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl), and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.  The mechanisms of this reaction were investigated using isotopically labeled glucose and glycine.  In these models, HCAs were found to form adducts with transient Maillard reaction flavor precursors, such as sugar fragments, as well as amino acids and amino acid reaction products.\n\nTo further study the effect of HCAs on aroma development, the influence of whole wheat flour, in comparison to refined wheat flour, on bread crust aroma was investigated.  Differences in the aroma profile between the two breads were characterized by both comparative gas chromatography-olfactometry-aroma extract dilution analysis (GC-O-AEDA) and quantitative gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-chemical ionization (GC-MS-CI) analysis utilizing stable isotope surrogate standards.  For refined bread crust (versus the whole wheat crust) five compounds were reported to be higher in concentration, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, 2-phenylethanol, 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline and 2,4-dihydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone by 4.0, 3.0, 2.1, 1.7, and 1.5-fold, respectively; whereas three compounds were at lower concentrations, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, and (E)-2-nonenal by 6.1-, 2.1-, and 1.8-fold, respectively.  Evaluation of the bread crust by a trained sensory panel reported the perceived aroma intensity of the characteristic \u2018fresh refined bread crust\u2019 aroma was significantly higher in the refined bread sample in comparison to the whole wheat sample; however when the five aroma compounds, that were higher in the refined bread crust, were added to the whole wheat crust at equivalent concentrations, no significant differences in the aroma intensity were observed.\n\nLiberation of HCAs from the predominantly insoluble conjugate (bound) form in wheat bran, and their effect on aroma development in bread was further studied through the use of 13C6-benzene ring labeled ferulic acid.  The addition of free ferulic acid to a refined wheat bread system, comparable to the amount released in whole wheat bread after fermentation and baking, resulted in an aroma profile similar to whole wheat bread crust, in that there was a reduction in the generation of five aroma compounds (2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2,4-dihydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone, 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline, 2-phenylethanol and 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone), similar to that observed in whole wheat bread.  However, the concentrations of lipid oxidation products ((E)-2-nonenal and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal) remained consistent in concentration to that found in refined bread.\n\nIn conclusion, the addition of HCAs to both simple and complex model systems affects the aroma generation in thermally-treated systems.  HCAs appear to trap transient sugar fragments and amino acid reaction products, with the largest effect observed for the key bread aroma compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline.  In addition to HCAs altering aroma development in bread, a second mechanism of aroma generation, related to lipid oxidation, was also found to lead to differences in aroma observed between the two types of bread.  This suggests a dual effect of the presence of the entire wheat seed on aroma generation in bread, which can provide new modes to control flavor development in whole wheat bread.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7939], "author_name_tesi": "Moskowitz, Marlene ", "last_name_ssi": "Moskowitz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Marlene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Devin Peterson", "Ryan John Elias", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "John Coupland", "John E Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Devin Peterson, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Chair", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "John Coupland, Committee Member", "John E Hayes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Maillard reaction", "bread", "whole wheat", "refined", "ferulic acid", "aroma generation", "2-acetyl-1-pyrroline"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Utilization of Public Assistance Among Mexican-americans in the Black Belt South: Implications of 1996 Welfare and Immigration Reform", "id": "18905", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3284", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study compares the utilization of public assistance by Mexicans in the Black Belt South before and after the implementation of The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunities Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996.

The three public assistance programs evaluated in this study are: Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) now known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Food Stamps (FS) now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The Current Population (CPS) data for years 1991 and 2001 were used in this study. For this analysis the 1991 and 2001 March CPS data have been restricted to the Black Belt South States and household heads. Public assistance or welfare and supplemental security income are measured at the family level, as is the value of Food Stamps.  For these analyses, a family-level data file was created in which the individual demographic and socio-economic data for the family householder was used and supplemented by information about his or her family (from the CPS family record) and household (from the CPS household record). In this analysis the data are weighted by population weight divided by its mean to achieve a weighted number of cases that aligns with sample size. This ensures the data are representative of the U.S. population but also yields fair tests of statistical significance.

The shortage of fossil fuels as the number one resource of energy carrier has emphasized the need for revising the current trend of energy consumption. Additionally, the public awareness of carbon footprint problems has compelled experts to take proper environmental measurements. Energy efficiency measures are widely spread nowadays, and the main issue is to determine the most effective strategies. Recent statistics show that building sector is the main contributor to the world total energy consumption, which makes it responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In particular, commercial buildings are under a special focus as they consume about 18% of total energy in the United States (U.S.).  \n\nSince over 80% of the total energy use in buildings happens during the operational phase, governments have been employing several policies to support energy consumption reduction during buildings operation phase as an instantaneous and cost-effective method to decrease GHG emissions. Several factors including design and installation of suitable technology and occupants can significantly contribute to the success of energy efficiency measures. The proper design of buildings necessitates paying specific attention to the conceptual stage since numerous possible design options are made and roughly assessed to achieve the optimum solution. The diversity of proposed measures in the literature requires the decision maker to recompense several factors including environmental, energy, cost, and social factors to achieve the optimum solution. This requires designers to have access to a unique energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly model to address the interdependency of building design parameters and occupancy behaviors considering the whole life cycle of commercial buildings. \n\nThe primary goal of the proposed research is to develop a multi-objective optimization tool to assess the impacts of building design parameters on total energy consumption, associated environmental impacts, and total cost during the life cycle of commercial buildings as well as identifying the optimum solutions, which can satisfy all other objectives. The outcomes of this research provide the industry with a tool to identify a more sustainable, affordable, and occupant satisfactory construction.\n\nThis research has been accomplished through the fulfilment of multiple pre-defined tasks. These pre-defined tasks include identifying the construction-based and occupant-based parameters influencing the energy consumption of buildings and equip a case study building with sub-metering instruments. The outcomes of these tasks were used in the next tasks to calibrate the energy models and develop the multi-objective optimization tool. The optimization tool, utilizes a Harmony Search (HS) based search engine to determine the optimum solution. The final task of this research was to prepare a proper Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate the use of the optimization tool. Although the developed optimization tool is focused on the Life Cycle Emission (LCE), Life Cycle Cost (LCC), and occupants\u2019 thermal satisfaction, it can be extended and modified to include other types of objectives. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16785], "author_name_tesi": "Mostavi, Ehsan ", "last_name_ssi": "Mostavi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ehsan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Somayeh Asadi", "Somayeh Asadi", "James Freihaut", "Lisa Domenica Iulo", "Ute Poerschke", "Chimay Anumba"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Somayeh Asadi, Dissertation Advisor", "Somayeh Asadi, Committee Chair", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Lisa Domenica Iulo, Committee Member", "Ute Poerschke, Outside Member", "Chimay Anumba, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building energy performance", "building design optimization", "occupants' behavior", "harmony search algorithm", "building envelope design tool", "multiobjective optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "FLOOR LIVING: ACTIVATING AN EVOCATIVE ARCHITECTURE BY COMPUTATION AND BODILY INTERACTION", "id": "14026nfm5140", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis proposes an architecture that fosters a connection between the virtual and the physical world for people (bodies) who are absorbed by the possibility of doing almost anything and of being almost anywhere in the virtual world.

The focus of this dissertation is to examine the physiological status over the lifespan of mice genetically modified to exhibit low levels of IGF-1 throughout their bodies with the goal of evaluating the use of these mice for testing theories of aging. These mice have been termed \"midi mice\". Midi mice attained a longer median lifespan, defined as the point in time at which 50% of the population had died. Female midi mice (n=26) achieved a median lifespan of 768 d which was longer (p < 0.01) than that attained by control female mice (725 d, n = 22). Male midi mice (n = 22) attained a median lifespan of 778 d, which was longer than the median lifespan attained by male control mice (721 d, n = 30). Male midi mice also showed an increased maximum lifespan (897 d), defined as tenth percentile survivors, compared to male controls (813 d) (p <0.05). There was no difference in maximum lifespan between female midi mice (813 d) and female controls (822 d), p = 0.11. We found increased weight in male and female controls from 100 d to 495 d of age, while male and female midi mice maintained approximately the same body weight. At 100 d of age, energy expenditure was approximately twice that of 495 d old mice. Control mice did not vary in physical activity by sex or age, in contrast all midi mice showed a significant increase in physical activity with age. Core body temperature increased with age in all groups except male midi mice, which remained lowest throughout life. Diurnal patterns of energy expenditure, physical activity, and core body temperature were similar across all groups throughout the lifespan although actual values were different. At 100 d of age, BMD was lower (p<0.0001) in midi mice compared to controls, with no effect between sexes of either genotype (p = 0.321). At 495\u00b15 d, BMD was lower in midi mice (p<0.0001) compared to controls. Sex also influenced BMD (p=0.010), with males of both genotypes exhibiting lower BMD in older animals.

All mice expressed similar non-stress levels of liver HSP70 and liver HSP90, both of which are ubiquitously expressed. Following hyperthermia, male midi and male control mice produced the highest levels of liver HSP90, followed by female midis. Female control mice produced the lowest level of liver HSP90 following the hyperthermia stressor. Following hyperthermia, midi mice expressed slightly higher levels of liver HSP70 than controls. Following hyperthermia treatment, liver CRP levels were significantly lower in female midi mice than both male and female control mice. Liver CRP levels were lower in male midi mice than all other groups. Of unique interest, oxidative damage, measured as nmols carbonyls per mg liver protein in post-hyperthermia treatment mice was higher in midi mice compared to control mice (p < 0.02, n = 36, 9 per group). Mouse common cytokines were also examined, however, no differences were found in liver between control and midi mice for IL1A, IL1B, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL12A, IL13, IL17A, G-CSF, GM-CSF (n=6 per genotype; 3 males and 3 females per genotype).

The pulmonary epithelial injury produced by pollutant exposure varies with sites in the tracheobronchial tree. Site-specific damages are believed to correlate with the local species dose delivered to the tissue. In order to predict the local dose, we present here semi-analytical Graetz-based and dynamic computational fluid dynamic (CFD)-based dosimetry models. The respiratory tract of a two-month-old rhesus monkey was selected as the platform for this study. The airway geometry model was created by reconstructing airways with diameters larger than 1 millimeter using MRI data, with the remaining airways generated using an axisymmetric single-path geometry model.\n\nThe Graetz-based model is a computationally efficient tool capable of considering both axial and radial variations in reactive species concentration within the lung airways under the quasi-steady state condition. We utilized the Graetz-based model to obtain the distribution of a moderately reactive and/or water-soluble pollutant (ozone) and a highly reactive and/or water-soluble gas (formaldehyde). The accuracy of the Graetz-based model in predicting the species uptake was tested by comparing the species concentration distributions calculated by the Graetz-based model with those computed through the numerical solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes, continuity, and convection-diffusion equations. The average ozone and formaldehyde concentrations exiting through the airways of selected lung pathways were calculated using the Graetz-based model and the numerical model. A comparison of the results showed that the concentration distribution predicted by the semi-analytical Graetz-based model was in good agreement with that resulting from more computationally demanding numerical simulation especially for moderately reactive and/or water-soluble pollutant. Therefore, although the Graetz-based model is incapable of predicting the local three-dimensional features of the species wall flux, it can be used to accurately obtain the uptake in airways of different pathways in the lung.\n\nPrevious dosimetry models were limited to quasi-steady inspiratory/expiratory flow simulations with constant flow rates, thereby overlooking the realistic time cyclical flow rates of tidal breathing. In order to take the pulsatile nature of breathing into account, we performed dynamic tidal breathing simulations of species transport in a complete anatomically correct model of the respiratory tract. The time-dependent flow field and species concentration distribution were obtained through the numerical solution of the governing equations (the Navier-Stokes, continuity, and species convection-diffusion equations), assuming a sinusoidal breathing waveform. Dynamic tidal breathing simulations were performed for a moderately reactive and/or water-soluble pollutant (ozone) and a highly reactive and/or water-soluble gas (formaldehyde). Our simulation results show that about 76 % of the inhaled ozone reacts at the walls of the respiratory tract, while the rest is exhaled back to the ambient atmosphere during expiration. Moreover, the model results show that about 36 %, 0.8 %, 0.5 %, and 63 % of the total ozone uptake occur at the nasal cavity, oral cavity, larynx, and the tracheobronchial tree, respectively. The results of dynamic formaldehyde transport simulations predict that over 99 % of inhaled formaldehyde reacts at the walls of the respiratory tracts. Instantaneous reactive species flux distributions at the airway walls were also determined, and the time-averaged uptake pattern was calculated by integrating the instantaneous uptake profiles over the full cycle of tidal breathing. The hotspots for ozone flux were observed at the nasal vestibule, the medial part of the nasopharynx, the medial part of the oropharynx, and the posterior wall of the larynx inlet. In the tracheobronchial tree, high flux regions were found to be located at the carina of the bifurcations (especially the first bifurcation below the trachea). Additional hot spots for ozone flux was identified at the walls of the respiratory bronchiole, a finding consistent with in-vivo observations. Our simulations predict high formaldehyde flux regions to locate at the nasal vestibule, dorsal and ventral parts of the middle turbinate, the ventral part of the inferior meatus, and the medial part of the inferior turbinate.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13782], "author_name_tesi": "Motevalian, Seyed Pouria", "last_name_ssi": "Motevalian", "middle_name_ssi": "Pouria", "first_name_ssi": "Seyed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Borhan", "Ali Borhan", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "James Ultman", "Rebecca Bascom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Borhan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Borhan, Committee Chair", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member", "James Ultman, Committee Member", "Rebecca Bascom, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dosimetry Modeling", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Mass Trasnport", "Respiratory Tract"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Attacking Anonymization and Constructing Improved Differentially Private Classifiers\n\n", "id": "11572", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1202", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Privacy is an important issue when publishing data that involves individuals' sensitive information.

This thesis addresses issues concerning two sanitization schemes, namely anatomy and differential privacy.\n\nA framework is developed for the purpose of attacking Anatomy sanitization scheme. This is done by trying to infer the sensitive values of individuals in data sets protected using Anatomy. A method for obtaining well calibrated probabilities of the sensitive value assignments is also proposed. Compared to the previous attacks, this attack algorithm is much simpler, quicker and also gives comparable accuracy levels.\n\nAny sanitization scheme basically destroys some information present in the data set in the process of protecting the sensitive data. This reduces the utility or usefulness of the data set. The utility of differentially private statistics is affected due to the noise added in the process of sanitization. We present a novel empirical Bayes' estimate for such statistics which improves its utility. The statistics are then used to construct a differentially private classifier. We observe that the classifiers' accuracy is enhanced using the proposed estimate. What makes this technique unique is that the method for improving utility does not use any kind of auxiliary information. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1190], "author_name_tesi": "Mothali, Chandrasekhar Venkata", "last_name_ssi": "Mothali", "middle_name_ssi": "Venkata", "first_name_ssi": "Chandrasekhar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Kifer", "Daniel Kifer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Kifer, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel Kifer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multi-variate Laplacian estimators", "data privacy", "anatomy", "sanitization", "differential privacy", "James-Stein"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Applications of Gold and Gold-copper Alloy Nanoparticles", "id": "14652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7491", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The unique physical and chemical properties of noble metal nanoparticles have enabled the materials to be utilized as invaluable tools for use in a wide range of disciplines. Many of these applications depend on the ability to intelligently modify the material shape, composition and structure. Low temperature solution methods have been shown to produce colloidally stable nanomaterials with a variety of shapes and compositions. In this dissertation I describe our recent contributions to the development and application of complex nanomaterials, specifically gold and gold-copper alloy nanoparticles.  \nWe first demonstrate the synthesis and investigation of composition-tunable gold-copper alloy nanoparticles. This investigation was undertaken to examine the relationship between the alloy nanoparticle composition and the resulting optical properties. Specifically, highly uniform particles were examined using both powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The resulting optical activity of the nanoparticles was compared with the theoretically predicted UV-Vis absorbance spectra. This study serves as a methodology template by which existing theoretical models can be tested with more complex systems.\nNext we describe the novel synthesis of Au-Cu2S hybrid nanoparticles via the phase segregation of AuCu alloy nanoparticles. Hybrid nanoparticles are characterized by discrete inorganic domains that are bound together through a solid-solid interface. These particles are often formed by nucleating the growth of a second inorganic domain on the surface of an existing particle through a seed mediated approach. As the complexity of nanomaterial synthesis and application increases, additional synthetic routes to these materials will be required. By heating AuCu alloy nanoparticles in the presence of sulfur it was possible to phase segregate the copper component to generate Au-Cu2S heterodimers with discrete Au and Cu2S components. The resulting particles were examined extensively with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy electron loss microscopy, (EELS), XRD, EDS and UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy. Additional control experiments were performed to support the phase segregation route to hybrid nanoparticles. This process demonstrates a new method of nanomaterial synthesis that can draw upon a vast library of alloy and intermetallic nanoparticles as precursor materials \nLastly, we demonstrate the use of both gold and copper nanoparticles for the fabrication of mesoscale components through modifying the existing lost mold \u2013 rapid infiltration forming (LM-RIF) process.  Several generations of components with nano- and microscale features were shown with progressivessive improvements on part fabrication. This work served as a proof of concept, demonstrating a general technique that could incorporate the vast array of metal nanoparticles available into part fabrication. In addition to the miniaturization of existing components, this process could potentially lead to such medical advances as microsurgical instruments and localized drug delivery.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7431], "author_name_tesi": "Motl, Nathan Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Motl", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Lasse Jensen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["colloidal hybrid nanoparticles", "nanoparticle heterodimers", "chemical transformations", "AuCu", "Au", "Cu2S", "plasmon", "alloy nanoparticle", "composition tunable"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Developing Sensitivity to Complex Facial Expressions in Adolescence\n", "id": "23615", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10803", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to produce and interpret facial expressions enables humans to communicate vital information in reciprocal social exchanges. In the first years of life, human infants begin to develop the ability to perceive and categorize basic emotional expressions (e.g. happy, sad, angry); however, these abilities continue to improve throughout childhood and into adolescence. Interestingly, very little is known about the developmental trajectory of sensitivity to more socially complex emotional expressions such as resentment, envy, or contempt. Importantly, the research that does exist has been conducted almost exclusively in atypical populations. In this project, we hypothesized that adolescence would be a key period for the emergence of sensitivity to socially complex expressions, largely because a subset of these expressions tend to provide signals about the status of more intimate relationships (i.e., with sexual and romantic partners and/or competitors) that adolescents are only beginning to form with their peers.  We also hypothesized that sensitivity to these complex expressions would be fundamentally related to pubertal maturation, which likely influences the motivation to form more intimate, romantic, and sexual relationships in adolescence. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted two experiments to measure developmental changes in perceptual sensitivity to detect both basic (e.g., happy) and complex emotional expressions in four groups: pre-pubescent children (ages 6-8), adolescents in early versus later stages of pubertal development (ages 11-14), and sexually mature adults (ages 20-25).

These social dimensions of face processing have direct relevance for motivating social behavior, like selecting and competing for potential mates. Therefore, men and women may be differentially sensitive to the visual information relevant to these dimensions. For example, structural characteristics of faces that convey dominance (e.g., signals of physical strength) may be especially relevant for males when considering behavior related to intrasexual mate competition. In contrast, structural characteristics of faces that convey attractiveness (e.g. signals of youth or fertility) may be especially relevant for females when considering behavior related to intrasexual mate competition. In what follows, I evaluated several hypotheses related to the own-gender bias (OGB) in face recognition (i.e. superior recognition for faces of one\u2019s own sex). First, I predicted that priming males to attend to dominance cues in other male faces would induce heightened sensitivity to male faces in a subsequent face recognition task. Second, I also tested the prediction that priming females to attend to attractiveness cues in other female faces would instigate heightened sensitivity to female faces in the same face recognition task. Finally, I predicted that the relationship between priming cues and the OGB would be influenced by relationship status and satisfaction, mate guarding, and individual differences in one\u2019s own attractiveness and dominance.\n\tAdult male and female participants were tested in a series of face processing tasks including perceptual sensitivity to detect facial attractiveness, dominance, and likeability, as well as a face recognition task. In addition, participants completed questionnaires related to their relationship status and provided physical measures of attractiveness and dominance. Participants were randomized into one of three conditions and completed either an attractiveness, dominance, or likeability perceptual trait judgment task prior to a face recognition task. I predicted that only those men in the dominance condition should experience an OGB, whereas the women in the attractiveness condition should experience an OGB. No modulation in recognition performance was expected for participants in the likeability condition.\n\tResults indicate that, across all three conditions, all participants exhibited greater recognition performance for female faces than male faces, but women in particular exhibited greater accuracy than men for female faces, regardless of condition. When evaluating inverse efficiency, however, this female superiority effect was not present. In addition, all participants exhibited lower perceptual thresholds (i.e. greater sensitivity) to detect each trait in male faces than in female faces. Finally, men\u2019s own dominance was inversely related to their sensitivity to detect dominance in male faces, and women\u2019s own attractiveness influenced their sensitivity to detect likeability, but not attractiveness, in other women\u2019s faces.

This classic green fluorophore is particularly suited for cellular analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry due to its excitation maximum at 490 nm, closely matching the 488 nm spectral line of the argon-ion laser. Under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4), fluorescein predominantly exists as a highly hydrophilic dianion exhibiting excellent quantum yield. However, protonation of fluorescein to the monoanion is observed with the relatively high pKa of 6.5, rendering this dye much less fluorescent in acidic solutions. Additionally, fluorescein is relatively susceptible to photobleaching. Oregon Green, a more acidic 2\u2019, 7\u2019-difluoro derivative of fluorescein, was developed as a less pH-sensitive fluorophore. The appended fluorine atoms reduce the pKa of this dye to 4.8, substantially improving both photostability and fluorescence at low pH.  Another more hydrophobic fluorescein analogue termed Tokyo Green was recently reported that replaces the carboxylate with a methyl group. This structural modification yields a highly fluorescent monoanion. We report a novel fluorophore termed Pennsylvania Green that combines the pH-insensitivity and photostability of Oregon Green with the hydrophobicity of Tokyo Green. To demonstrate the utility of the Pennsylvania Green fluorophore, we compared cellular membrane probes derived from 4-carboxy Tokyo Green and 4-carboxy Pennsylvania Green. Because of its lower pKa, only the Pennsylvania Green-derived probe enables facile visualization of acidic endosomes within living mammalian cells.\nWe also report an improved synthesis of the Pennsylvania Green fluorophore and its related 4-carboxy derivative.  4-Carboxy-Pennsylvania Green was prepared from 4-iodo-3-methyl-benzoic acid methyl ester in three steps and 32% overall yield. This new synthesis is a notable improvement over our original methods. Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase fusion proteins were treated with Pennsylvania Green and Oregon Green linked to O6-benzylguanine (SNAP-Tag substrates). Analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that Pennsylvania Green derivatives are substantially more cell permeable than analogous Orgeon Green Probes.\nUsing the improved synthetic methods identified for the preparation of Pennsylvania Green, four novel red fluorophores were designed and synthesized: Penn Fluor 550, Penn Fluor 555, Penn Fluor 576 and Penn Fluor 609.  The ability of biotinylated derivatives of these new fluorophores to image strepavidin fusion proteins in living mammalian cells was investigated.\nAs a non-fluorescent molecular probe of potential drug targets and the steroid chaperone cycle, we synthesized dimeric molecules design to control estrogen receptor and heat shock protein 90 in living cells.  Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an abundant ATP-dependent cellular chaperone that facilitates the folding of estrogen receptors (ERs) and other oncogenic proteins involved in cancer proliferation. This protein is under intense investigation as a target of anticancer drugs because breast cancer cells contain Hsp90 in an activated high affinity conformation that is particularly susceptible to Hsp90 inhibitors. These inhibitors include the anticancer agent geldanamycin (GDM), which is thought to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells in part by blocking agonist-induced release of steroid hormone receptors such as ERs from Hsp90. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of chimeric ligands derived from estrogens and GDM designed to heterodimerize ER and Hsp90 proteins. These compounds were found to enforce interactions between these proteins in vitro and uniquely affect the subcellular localization of ER alpha in a cancer cell line.\nWe also investigated a new class of immunosuppressant drugs called bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazoles (BTPs).  To probe the mechanism of action and molecular target of these new molecules, we designed BTP derivatives useful for affinity chromatography.  A biotinylated BTP successfully identified drebrin as a potential target of BTPs.  The binding of BTP to drebrin was further confirmed by western blot and confocal microscopy experiments. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3735], "author_name_tesi": "Mottram, Laurie Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Mottram", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Laurie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Blake R Peterson", "Philip C Bevilaqua", "Ken S Feldman", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Blake R Peterson, Committee Chair", "Philip C Bevilaqua, Committee Member", "Ken S Feldman, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluorescent probes", "molecular probes", "fluorophores"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Kinetics and mechanism of bacterial inactivation by ultrasound waves and sonoprotective effect of milk components\n\n", "id": "8168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4800", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The need for alternative food processing technologies that can be used to pasteurize foods while maintaining their fresh-like qualities is increasing due to increasing consumer demand for minimally processed foods. Ultrasound technology is one of the emerging alternate food processing technologies and uses sound waves with frequencies higher than 20 kHz to inactivate microorganisms. Microbial inactivation by ultrasound waves (USW) is attributed to cavitation which involves formation, growth and collapse of bubbles in a liquid medium. Although bacterial inactivation by USW has been studied extensively in buffers, the potential of USW to inactivate bacteria in real foods like milk still needs to be investigated. The first objective of this study was to determine the impact of sonication medium and growth phase on inactivation kinetics of E. coli and L. monocytogenes. Preliminary studies to select sonication frequency were conducted by comparing the inactivation of mid-log phase cells of E. coli upon treatment with high frequency (650, 765 and 850 kHz) and low frequency (24 kHz) USW in phosphate buffer. Ultrasound waves with high frequency were ineffective in inactivating E. coli, while low frequency ultrasound waves decreased the number of survivors by ~ 3 logs in 2.5 minutes. Therefore, 24 kHz ultrasound waves were used for this study. Mid-log or mid-stationary phase cells of E. coli and L. monocytogenes were treated with 24 kHz ultrasound waves in phosphate buffer, whole milk or skim milk. Log phase cells of E. coli and L. monocytogenes were more sensitive to ultrasound treatment than stationary phase cells in all three sonication media. Escherichia coli exhibited non-log linear inactivation kinetics with tailing while L. monocytogenes exhibited log linear inactivation kinetics throughout. Ultrasound treatment exhibited minimal injury to bacteria suggesting that inactivation of bacteria by USW was following all or nothing phenomenon. The D values for inactivation of mid stationary-phase cells of E. coli were 2.19, 2.43 and 2.41 min in phosphate buffer, whole milk and skim milk, whereas those for L. monocytogenes were 7.63, 9.31 and 8.61 min, respectively. Significantly higher (p < 0.05) D values for inactivation of E. coli and L. monocytogenes in whole and skim milk as compared to phosphate buffer suggested that milk exerts a sonoprotective effect on these bacteria. However, the D values for both the organisms were not significantly different between whole and skim milk indicating that fat in milk does not exert a sonoprotective effect on these bacteria.\n\nIn the second part of the study the sonoprotective effect of milk components, lactose, casein and &#946; lactoglobulin, on E. coli and L. monocytogenes was investigated. Lactose, casein, or &#946; lactoglobulin was added to simulated milk ultrafiltrate (SMUF) at a concentration of 5, 3 and 0.3g/100 ml, respectively. Casein was added to SMUF as a non-micellar, sodium caseinate or a micellar, phosphocasein, to investigate the differences in protection conferred due to its physical form. In another experiment, all three components were added to SMUF to determine the combined protective effect of these components on bacteria. Presence of casein in micellar and non-micellar forms did not result in a significant change in the D values compared to SMUF for inactivation of both organisms. Addition of whey protein &#946; lactoglobulin to SMUF also did not result in a significant change in D value for E. coli while that for L. monocytogenes increased significantly (p < 0.05). Presence of lactose in SMUF, however, resulted in significant increase (p < 0.05) in D values for inactivation of both the organisms. The D values for E. coli in SMUF and SMUF + lactose were 2.84 and 3.42 min; while those for L. monocytogenes were 7.3 and 8.52 min, respectively, suggesting that lactose was conferring a protective effect on these bacteria. Moreover, D values obtained in  SMUF + lactose were not significantly different from those in skim milk for either organism, suggesting that amongst the components tested lactose alone was conferring a significant protective effect to bacteria. There was no significant increase in D values when E. coli and L. monocytogenes were sonicated in SMUF containing all the three components suggesting that milk components do not exert any additive or synergistic protective effect against ultrasound treatment.\n\nScanning electron microscopy of ultrasound-treated cells of E. coli and L. monocytogenes was conducted to see the morphological changes in cell structure upon sonication. The SEM images demonstrated that ultrasound treatment resulted in physical damage to cell wall and cell membrane of E. coli and L. monocytogenes cells, leading to their death. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4777], "author_name_tesi": "Motwani, Neetu ", "last_name_ssi": "Motwani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Neetu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephanie Doores"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephanie Doores, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["L. monocytogenes", "Ultrasound waves", "Milk", "E. coli", "Sonoprotection"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "State of Water in Starch-Water Systems in the Gelatinization Temperature Range as Investigated using Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy", "id": "10195", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6292", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Starch-water interactions occurring during gelatinization are critical for developing a mechanistic understanding of the gelatinization process.

The relaxation time range of what were considered to be the high, intermediate and low frequency relaxations were 4-9 ps, 20-25 ps and 230-620 ps, respectively. The high frequency relaxation was observed at all starch concentrations, while the intermediate and low frequency relaxation were only observed at starch concentrations of 10% and above, and 30% and above, respectively. The high frequency relaxation was attributed to bulk water, while the intermediate and low frequency relaxations were attributed to rotationally restrained water molecules present in the starch-water system. To investigate the state of water in the gelatinization temperature range, the dielectric response, gelatinization enthalpy and water absorption by 10%, 30% or 50% starch slurries were measured after heating the slurries to different end temperatures between 40-90\u00b0C for 30 min. The high frequency relaxation time for 10% starch slurry dropped significantly (P<0.001) upon heating up to 60\u00b0C. For 30% and 50% starch slurries, high frequency relaxation times were not significantly influenced (P>0.159) by heating up to 80\u00b0C.  The intermediate and low frequency relaxation times were not significantly influenced (P>0.712) by heating for all starch concentrations. Also, the amount of water associated with the three relaxations was not significantly influenced by heating (P >0.187).  The water absorption results indicated that highest water uptake was achieved in the 10% starch slurry. The endothermic peak associated with gelatinization either vanished or was diminished after heating the slurries to 60\u00b0C and above, suggesting that native granular order was not necessary for the existence of the three separate states of water.  \n\nIn the second part of the project, the dielectric response of starch-water systems was investigated in the presence or absence of glucose or maltose. Dielectric response of 10% starch + 10% sugar, 10% starch + 20% sugar or 10% starch + 30% sugar slurries was measured in the frequency range of 200 MHz-20 GHz after heating the slurries to different end temperatures between 25-90\u00b0C for 30 min. The dielectric spectra of the slurries could be deconvoluted to obtain up to three Debye-type relaxations. The relaxation time range of high, intermediate and low frequency relaxations were 4-7 ps, 17-26 ps and 175-335 ps, respectively, at 25\u00b0C. The high frequency relaxation was the dominant relaxation in slurries containing 10% sugar, and the intermediate frequency relaxation was the dominant relaxation in slurries containing 30% sugar at 25\u00b0C. The high frequency relaxation time decreased upon heating up to 60\u00b0C but was not significantly influenced (P>0.102) by the concentration or the type of sugar.  Intermediate and low frequency relaxation times were not significantly influenced (P>0.419) by heating or sugar type. The relative strengths of the intermediate frequency relaxation dropped while that of high frequency relaxation increased upon heating up to 50\u00b0C. The relative strength of low frequency relaxation (P>0.561) was not influenced by heating. The static dielectric constant decreased upon heating but was not influenced by the type of sugar or solids in the slurry. This indicated that the water molecules present in the system were the major contributors to the polarization observed. At the same concentration of solids, conductivity of the sugar containing slurries was lower than that of the non-sugar-containing starch slurries, which suggested that conductivity was mostly associated with starch. Glucose or maltose did not exert any differential effect on the swelling behavior or dielectric relaxation parameters of starch-water-sugar slurries. \n\nThis project presents novel insights into the starch-water interactions occurring in the gelatinization temperature range. The results of this project can be used to develop a dielectric relaxation based technique to monitor water mobility during industrial processing of starch-based foods. Dielectric response was not unique to any of the solids used in the study suggesting that dielectric spectroscopy could be used for monitoring state of water in food systems containing different types of solids. Also, the dielectric relaxation parameters obtained in this study can be used to predict water mobility in simple food systems having water, sugar and starch as major components, and hence, can possibly be used to estimate shelf life of food products. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6292], "author_name_tesi": "Motwani, Tanuj ", "last_name_ssi": "Motwani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tanuj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Dr John Floros", "Dr Donald Thompson", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Dissertation Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Chair", "Dr John Floros, Committee Member", "Dr Donald Thompson, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["starch gelatinization", "dielectric spectroscopy", "relaxation time", "relaxation strength"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Multiple Trains Of Same-Color Surface Plasmon-Polaritons Guided by the Planar\nInterface of a Metal Film and a Sculptured Nematic Thin Film\n\n", "id": "9650", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3978", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A sculptured nematic thin film (SNTF) is an assembly of parallel nanowires that are shaped in a fixed plane orthogonal to the substrate on hich the film is deposited.

The thermistor in the material heats up upon absorbing infrared radiation.  The resistivity (\u03c1) of this material is lowered by the heat and is detected by a readout circuitry.  Improvement of device performance may arise from improving the temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR).  For several years, vanadium oxide (VOx) thin films have been used as the thermally active material in these bolometer devices due to the somewhat controllable \u03c1 and high TCR nature.\n\tPrior research has shown that often VOx thin films with more desirable electrical properties exhibit a nanocomposite structure consisting of highly defective nanocrystalline domains of face-centered cubic VOx (0.8 \u2264 x \u2264 1.3) phase embedded within an amorphous matrix of VOx with x > 2.  Attempts were made to fabricate reference materials of each of these constituents of the nanocomposite by means of reactive pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering in order to obtain a reference database of the electrical properties and the optical properties obtained via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE).  In doing so, it has been discovered that many deposition parameters such as oxygen flow rates, substrate temperature, substrate bias, and the substrate surface, itself, affect the resulting VOx thin film growth and nucleation.  The strong substrate dependence of these films dictates the crystallinity, overall phase, and structural evolution of the VOx thin films.  VOx thin films grown on single crystal Al2O3 have exhibited higher degrees of crystallinity and predominately V2O3 like in structure, which lead to undesirably low TCR magnitudes (0.09 \u2013 0.59 \uf02d%/K).  VOx thin films grown on single crystal MgO have been shown to have different results than that of the VOx on Al2O3 as the TCR is much higher, and thus more desirable (2.23- 3.59 \uf02d%/K). These films on MgO were highly disordered and had the highest values of TCR for given resistivity known to the author to date.  VOx thin films grown on LPCVD SiNx coated c-Si wafers exhibited intermediate effects of mixed V2O3 and FCC-VOx nanocrystallites with TCR magnitudes ranging from 0.59 to 1.56 \uf02d%/K.  The difference between temperature and substrate bias effects on these phenomena was also evaluated.\n\tVOx growth and evolution was monitored in situ via real time spectroscopic ellipsometry (RTSE) for unbiased films grown on unheated dielectric coated c-Si wafers .  By modeling the data obtained from RTSE, it has been shown that morphology of the as-deposited VOx thin film and post deposition conditions, such as post-sputtering and atmospheric exposure, lead to an overall phase reconstruction of nanocomposite VOx.   Amorphous VOx thin films exhibit more stability with respect to post-deposition exposure to process gases and atmosphere than the nanocomposite VOx thin films.  This behavior implies that the nanocrystallites or grain boundary components in unbiased VOx thin films are more susceptible to these types of changes.\nPost-deposition annealing in previous studies has been shown to be a potential method to improve the electrical properties of VOx thin films deposited without a substrate bias.  The post-deposition annealing in this work was conducted with a different experimental setup on VOx thin films deposited with a substrate bias.  The annealing process was monitored via RTSE in order to non-destructively observe the optical properties in the form of the dielectric function spectra, \u03b5=\u03b5_1+\"i\" \u03b5_2, vary as a function of temperature.  By annealing the as-deposited VOx thin films in different ambients, more favorable TCR values for a given resistivity were observed.\nBy obtaining \u03b5 for various phases of VOx, effective medium) theory has been applied in order to try to obtain initial models of nanocrystalline volume fractions within nanocomposite VOx thin films.  These models are preliminary in that a specific set of \u03b5 for nanocrystalline and amorphous VOx was implemented to represent the \u201cend points\u201d components.  Each of these constituents varies a great deal with oxygen incorporation and is reflected in \u03b5.  Despite this, initial representative models of nanocrystalline content have been obtained.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8019], "author_name_tesi": "Motyka, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Motyka", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark William Horn", "Nikolas Podraza", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "S Ashok", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark William Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Nikolas Podraza, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Special Member", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vanadium oxide", "thin films", "spectroscopic ellipsometry", "thin film deposition", "magnetron sputtering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Plasma-Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition ZnO For Multifunctional Thin Film Electronics", "id": "10987", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1654", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A novel, weak oxidant, plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process has been used to fabricate stable, high mobility ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) and fast circuits on glass and polyimide substrates at 200 \u00b0C.  Weak oxidant PEALD provides a simple, fast deposition process which results in uniform, conformal coatings and highly crystalline, dense ZnO thin films.  These films and resulting devices have been compared with those prepared by spatial atomic layer deposition (SALD) throughout the work.  \n\nBoth PEALD and SALD ZnO TFTs have high field-effect mobility (>20 cm2/V\u2022s) and devices with ALD Al2O3 passivation can have excellent bias stress stability.  Temperature dependent measurements of PEALD ZnO TFTs revealed a mobility activation energy < 5 meV and can be described using a simple percolation model with a Gaussian distribution of near-conduction band barriers.  Interestingly, both PEALD and SALD devices operate with mobility > 1 cm2/V\u2022s even at temperatures < 10 K.  The effects of high energy irradiation have also been investigated.  Devices exposed to 1 MGy of gamma irradiation showed small threshold voltage shifts (<2 V) which were fully recoverable with short (1 min) low-temperature (200 \u00b0C) anneals.  \n\nZnO TFTs exhibit a range of non-ideal behavior which has direct implications on how important parameters such as mobility and threshold voltage are quantified.  For example, the accumulation-dependent mobility and contact effects can lead to significant overestimations in mobility.  It is also found that self-heating plays and important role in the non-ideal behavior of oxide TFTs on low thermal conductivity substrates.  In particular, the output conductance and a high current device runaway breakdown effect can be directly ascribed to self-heating.\n\nAdditionally, a variety of simple ZnO circuits on glass and flexible substrates were demonstrated.

They have great potential for revolutionizing the automotive industries as well. Concurrently, rechargeable sodium-ion batteries are also gaining popularity for large-scale grid energy storage in the renewable energy sector. Continuous growth of these industries is creating a great demand for these rechargeable batteries in the market. As a result, there is a great drive among researchers for developing high-performance lithium and sodium ion batteries. \nThis dissertation was focused on developing high-performance anode and cathode materials for lithium and sodium ion batteries. At first, a carbon coated spherical graphite-silicon composite was developed for rechargeable lithium ion battery system. The main purpose of this work was to develop a composite that shows higher capacity than commercial graphite anode material (372 mAhg-1) and maintains long cyclic stability. The composite material exhibited a reversible capacity of ~ 675 mAhg-1 with very decent coulobmic efficiency of 83%. The material also demonstrated long cycle stability with a capacity retention of ~ 85% after 300 cycles. It also showed good compatibility with commercial lithium ion cathode when paired in a full cell setup. \nNext, a carbon coated SiO-Si-Mg2SiO4 composite anode material was developed for rechargeable lithium ion battery system. The main purpose of this work was to address the lower initial coulombic efficiency of SiO anode material. The composite material demonstrated improved initial coulombic efficiency of ~ 74.2% and higher specific capacity of ~ 2250 mAhg-1.

The main purpose of this work was to improve the capacity and rate performance of layered cathode material.

Suez Canal, Egypt, was one of the water sheds that suffered from the impact of crude oil spill especially the one dated December 14, 2004 10,000 tons of spilled crude oil. The aim of this research was to synthesize, test and develop a sorbent material capable of adsorbing crude oil spilled from water. Previous studies showed that exfoliated graphite (EG) is a promising material that can be used to adsorb hydrocarbon compounds. However, finding the proper way to utilize the EG is still a challenging problem. Also, the effect of some parameters such as temperature and type of the crude oil has not been widely investigated. The research herein had the following goals: (1) assess the effect of the exfoliation temperature on the sorption efficiency and the properties of the product; (2) assess and compare the effect of two different exfoliation time on the sorption efficiency and the properties of the product; and (3) find an applicable form of the exfoliated graphite for the oil spill remedy application.\nTo this end, the exfoliation time was found to have a great impact on the exfoliation volume and consequently on the crude oil sorption capacity, where the rate of expansion increases gradually and then decreases until the exfoliation temperature reaches 800 0C. After this temperature, there is no significant impact for the exfoliation time, however the exfoliation volume continues to increase with a very low rate. Also, the exfoliated graphite density was found to decrease gradually from 44 g/l at 400\u201eaC to 3.10 g/l at 1000\u201eaC for the samples exfoliated for 60 seconds, and from 45.44 g/l at 300\u201eaC to 3.31 g/l at 1000\u201eaC for the samples exfoliated for 120 seconds. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) for the graphite exfoliated for 60 seconds showed that the sulfur still exists in the exfoliated sample at 950\u201eaC. However, there no sulfur was detected after exfoliation at 1000\u201eaC with the XRD data did not show any sulfur content for the tested samples exfoliated for 120 seconds starting from 650\u201eaC. On the other hand, SEM/EDS detected sulfur content in all the samples exfoliated for 60 s and 120 s, which decreases as the exfoliation temperature increases, even after exfoliation for 120 s at 1000\u201eaC. The maximum sorption capacity achieved is ~ 82 (kg of oil/kg of sorbent) which is about double the capacity of any other natural sorbent material reported so far. It was expected that the sorption capacity would increase with increasing the atmospheric temperature, however an interesting finding was that there is a minimal effect of atmospheric temperature on the sorption capacity of the exfoliated graphite when tested for Pennsylvania crude oil sorption. It was found also that the applicability of the EG is greatly modified by using fiber glass as a packaging material giving a maximum adsorption capacity of ~ 68 kg of crude oil per kg of the new composite material introducing the maximum sorption capacity for the applicable form of the exfoliated graphite.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [562], "author_name_tesi": "Moustafa, Ahmed Mohamed Abdel-hakim", "last_name_ssi": "Moustafa", "middle_name_ssi": "Mohamed Abdel-hakim", "first_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Fred Scott Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Exfoliated graphite", "oil spills"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Equal Educational Opportunity for Language Minority Students from Diverse Backgrounds: An Assessment\n", "id": "7501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3966", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the number of immigrants increases, American schools face the challenge of how to meet the needs of a growing language minority student population.

One potential source for these UHECR is black hole engines in\nactive galaxies. It is known that active galaxies have jets of relativistic charged particles\nthat follow their rotational axes, however the composition of these jets is still unknown,\nand hadrons must be present in the cosmic accelerators. Neutrino detections coincident\nwith photon flaring from AGN would provide strong evidence for hadrons in blazar\njets. If no hadrons are present, gamma-ray production in AGN jets would be driven by\nelectron synchrotron-self Compton processes.\nIn an attempt to test the hadronic hypothesis for blazar jets, we developed a\ncatalog of significant hard x-ray photon excesses from blazars using the Swift BAT monitoring\ncatalog and a new wavelet approach adapted from the statistics literature.

Within the test range of this research, all fuels and their blends where driven to their critical compression ratio (the onset of HTHR); and it was observed through heat-release analysis and of CO emissions trends comparison that the saturated methyl ester (mhx) exhibited cool-flame behavior while its unsaturated counterpart did not. This observation agrees with previous studies by Zhang and Boehman that the presence of a double-bond in the aliphatic chain suppresses cool-flame behavior by inhibiting isomerization reactions of peroxy radicals that are key to low-temperature oxidation chemistry. All blends with ethanol had a roughly linear effect on the delay of the onset of HTHR. Another trend observed was that blends with increasing ethanol content had a lower magnitude of LTHR and an onset occurring further after top dead center at the same compression ratio indicating that blends with increasing ethanol content are less reactive in the low-temperature regime. Interestingly, the magnitude of LTHR increases with increasing compression ratio for mhx/hept blends while the magnitude of LTHR was noted to decrease for pure mhx. Further, it was observed that the magnitude of the LTHR at the critical compression ratio decreases with increasing ethanol content for pure mhx and its n-heptane blends as a result of the inhibiting effect of ethanol on ignition.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4788], "author_name_tesi": "Moyer, Orin D", "last_name_ssi": "Moyer", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Orin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["methyl hexenoate", "C7", "motored engine", "esters", "biodiesel", "CFR", "methyl hexanaote", "autoignition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Scalable Web Content Attestations\n\n\n", "id": "9628", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6245", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The web is a primary means of information sharing for most organizations\nand people.

In this work a spectral zone is defined as a zone made up of a number of nodes whose characteristics are collectively similar and that are assigned the same few-group diffusion constants. In other words the spectral zones are the regions over which the few-group diffusion parameters are generated. \nThe identification of spectral boundaries is treated as an optimization problem. It is solved by systematically and simultaneously repositioning all zone boundaries to achieve the global minimum error between the reference transport solution (MCNP) and the diffusion code solution (NEM). The objective function for the optimization algorithm is the total reaction rate error, which is defined as the sum of the leakage, absorption and fission reaction rates error in each zone. An iterative determination of group-dependent bucklings is incorporated into the methodology to properly account for spectral effects of neighboring zones. A preferred energy group structure has also been chosen. \nThis optimization approach with the reference transport solution has proved to be accurate and consistent, however the computational effort required to complete the optimization process is significant. Thus a more practical methodology is also developed for the determination of the spectral zones in PBRs. The reactor physics characteristics of the spectral zones have been studied to understand the nature of the spectral zone boundaries. The practical tool involves the use of spectral indices based on few-group diffusion theory whole core calculations. With this methodology, there is no need to first have a reference transport solution. It is shown that the diffusion-theory coarse group fluxes and the effective multiplication factor computed using zones based on the practical index agrees within a narrow tolerance with those of the reference approach. Therefore the \u201cpractical\u201d index provides a convenient method for the determination of spectral zones without the recourse to a reference transport solution.\nThe use of the optimum spectral boundaries together with the preferred energy group structure renders the NEM code a practical tool for analyzing the PBR core.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5443], "author_name_tesi": "Mphahlele, Ramatsemela ", "last_name_ssi": "Mphahlele", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramatsemela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Abderrafi M Ougouag", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Yousry Y Azmy", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Hans D Gougar", "Herman Knoble"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Abderrafi M Ougouag, Committee Chair", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Yousry Y Azmy, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Hans D Gougar, Committee Member", "Herman Knoble, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MICROX-2", "Spectral Zones", "High Temperature Reactor", "PBMR", "NEM", "Multi-group Diffusion Theory", "Cross Sections"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PERCEPTIONS OF 4-H EXTENSION EDUCATORS AND VOLUNTEER LEADERS TOWARD THE INCLUSION OF YOUTH WITH ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVE DISORDER(S) IN 4-H PROGRAMS\n\n", "id": "10219", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1182", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nThe purpose of this study was to determine the challenges, attitudes, training and support systems needed by 4-H Extension Educators and Volunteer Leaders in order to successfully and effectively include youth with ADHD in their programs.

A sample of 384 volunteer leaders was drawn and a census of the extension educators was invited to participate in this study. Two questionnaires (one for volunteer leaders and one for extension educators) with five sections each were developed to collect data. Data collected were primarily quantitative.

More recently, these vesicles are under study for their purported significant roles in intercellular communication in both healthy and diseased states.  Exosomes are secreted by all cancer types and have a major impact on the tumor microenvironment. Exosomes contain protected intracellular content, including DNA, RNA, and proteins that can be transferred to recipient cells. This transfer subsequently leads to enhanced tumorigenic properties including angiogenesis, cancer progression, and therapeutic resistance. Genetic components of the cell of origin can be included in the secreted exosomes. The presence of genetic material could serve as a biomarker for the presence of mutations in tumors leading to modification of treatment strategies. In the last decade, exosomes have been identified as having major implications in many aspects of medicine and tumor biology and appear to be primed to take a critical position in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.\nThe first aspect of my thesis studies the effects of changes in genotype on exosome phenotype by studying neuroblastoma cancer and hemochromatosis mutations. Neuroblastoma is the third most common childhood cancer, and timely diagnosis and sensitive therapeutic monitoring remain major challenges. Tumor progression and recurrence is common in advanced stages with little understanding of mechanisms. Although exosomes have been demonstrated to contribute to the oncogenic effect on the surrounding tumor environment and also mediate resistance to therapy, the effect of genotype on exosomal phenotype had not been explored. I interrogated exosomes from human neuroblastoma cells that express wild-type or mutant forms of the HFE gene. HFE, one of the most common autosomal recessive polymorphism in the Caucasian population, originally associated with hemochromatosis, has also been associated with increased tumor burden, therapeutic resistance boost, and negative impact on patient survival. Herein, I demonstrated that changes in genotype cause major differences in the molecular and functional properties of exosomes; specifically, HFE mutant derived exosomes have increased expression of proteins relating to invasion, angiogenesis, and cancer therapeutic resistance. HFE mutant derived exosomes were also shown to transfer this cargo to recipient cells and cause an increased oncogenic functionality in those recipient cells. This has major implications because it allows clinicians to profile and stratify cancer patients with HFE mutations and adapt therapeutic strategies to provide patients with the optimal survival outcome.\nThe second aspect of my thesis assessed the effects of radiation on exosome function and profile. Radiation therapy is essential in the arsenal of cancer treatment and is utilized in the therapeutic regimen of more than 50% of all cancer patients. Unfortunately, many aggressive malignancies may become resistant to radiation over time, rendering treatment futile. This mechanism of acquired radiation resistance is not understood. I investigated the hypothesis that acquired radiation resistance may occur through cellular communication via exosomes. Three aspects were analyzed: 1) exosome function, 2) exosome profile, and 3) exosome uptake/blockade. Radiation-derived exosomes increased cellular proliferation and radiation resistance in recipient tumor cells in vitro in cell culture. Furthermore, radiation-derived exosomes increased tumor burden and decreased survival in vivo in a murine model of glioblastoma. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that radiation-derived exosomes exhibit specific miRNA, mRNA, and protein expression changes favoring a resistant/proliferative profile. Radiation-derived exosomes upregulate oncogenic miR-889, CCND1, ANXA2, DERL1, WWC1, NPM1, SCD, ACTG1, FUT11, VAMP8, ZFR, DNM2, CISD1, RPL15, PPIC, and proteins involved in the proteasome, Notch, Jak-STAT, and cell cycle signaling pathways. Radiation-derived exosomes also downregulate tumor-suppressive miR-516, miR-365, TPM1, STAT4, LRRFIP1, TSPAN5, and CGGBP1. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed the top upregulated networks included cell growth, cell cycle, and cell survival. The top increased upstream regulator was the MYC oncogene. Upregulation of Dynamin 2 correlated with increased uptake of radiation-derived exosomes. In addition to inducing changes in recipient cells that promote a cancerous phenotype, I evaluated exosome blockade as a potential therapeutic. Heparin and simvastatin blocked uptake of radiation-derived exosomes in recipient cells and inhibited induction of cellular proliferation and radiation resistance, both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, I provide a novel exosome-based mechanism that may underlie acquired radiation resistance in patients harboring malignant cancers. Furthermore, I elucidate key factors carried by exosomes that may lead to tumor recurrence and subsequent therapeutic resistance. I also show the potential for advancement of cancer treatment, or understanding existing treatments, whose mechanism may be through exosome inhibition. By interrogating this mechanism, I ultimately aim to pave the way for the development and implementation of targeted exosome blocking agents to inhibit the acquired radiation resistance that inevitably leads to tumor recurrence and the devastating prognosis that follows.\nThe last aspect of my thesis assessed the effects of glioma cell stemness on exosome phenotype. One reason proposed for the ineffectiveness of the current therapeutic regimen of glioblastoma is glioma stem cells (GSCs). We investigated the hypothesis that the communication of GSCs to their microenvironment through exosomes is a key factor to the enhanced tumor burden and the development of resistance to therapeutics in glioblastoma. Two properties of exosomes were analyzed: 1) exosome function and 2) exosome profile. Exosomes secreted by patient derived-glioma stem cells (GSC-exosomes) increased cellular proliferation, radiation resistance, temozolomide resistance, and doxorubicin resistance. We further profiled the GSC-exosomes to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon. Profiling showed specific changes to RNA and protein favoring therapeutic resistance and cellular proliferation. GSC exosomes have increased expression of proteins involved in radiation and chemotherapeutic resistance (E.g. CDK4 and Notch), cellular proliferation (E.g. Cyclin B1 and Cyclin D2), angiogenesis (E.g. VEGF-A and EGFR), glioma cell stemness and de-differentiation (E.g. EPHA2, Cathepsin B), and cell invasion and metastasis (E.g. ITGA3, COL4A2). The results of our study provide a novel exosome-based mechanism that may underlie the aggressiveness of glioma cancer stem cells. Furthermore, we elucidate key factors carried by glioma stem cell derived exosomes that may lead to enhanced therapeutic resistance and increase in tumor burden.\nTogether, these data demonstrate the impact that exosomes have on multiple aspects of tumor biology. Exosomes are affected due to genotype, and thus genotype must be taken into consideration for cancer patient stratification. Exosomes are also are critical for radiation resistance and are reprogrammed due to radiation. Glioma stem cells secrete exosomes which have increased oncogenic contents and have an enhanced functional impact on recipient cancer cells. My studies have shown that treatment with heparin and simvastatin inhibits uptake of these cancer-derived exosomes which may lead to enhanced therapeutic efficacy in the cancer patient population.  My thesis also suggests that our current therapies to treat glioblastoma may be ineffective due to exosomes secreted by glioma stem cells in conjunction with exosomes secreted by glioma cells stressed with radiation. These secreted exosomes confer therapeutic resistance and may lead to subsequent tumor recurrence in the glioblastoma patient population. The results of my thesis offer direct recommendation for clinical studies that suggests utilizing our standard therapies in combination with exosome uptake inhibitors may lead to optimal patient outcomes.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16268], "author_name_tesi": "Mrowczynski, Oliver D", "last_name_ssi": "Mrowczynski", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Oliver", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "Brad Zacharia", "Barbara Ann Miller", "Jong Kak Yun", "Achuthamangalam B Madhankumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "Brad Zacharia, Committee Chair", "Barbara Ann Miller, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Achuthamangalam B Madhankumar, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["exosomes", "glioblastoma", "radiation", "glioma stem cell", "neuroblastoma", "HFE"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "GUIDED WAVE PROPAGATION AND FOCUSING IN VISCOELASTIC MULTILAYERED HOLLOW CYLINDERS", "id": "8569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The understanding of guided wave propagation characteristics, source influence, and mode control in hollow cylindrical structures is crucial for guided wave nondestructive evaluation of pipelines. This thesis reviews the previous guided wave theories on single elastic hollow cylinders and develops their application in pipe imaging and defect circumferential sizing. Motivated by the fact that most pipelines are coated with viscoelastic materials, the thesis establishes a systematic procedure targeting on solving the problem of guided wave propagation, source influence, as well as focusing in multilayered hollow cylindrical structures containing viscoelastic materials. \nA suitable Semi-Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) formulation is first developed to solve the dispersion curves (including axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric guided wave modes) and wave structures in viscoelastic multilayered hollow cylinders. Stress distributions across pipe thickness and the cross sectional deformations for different guided wave modes are illustrated to help interpret modal behavior. \nA general orthogonality relation applicable for both single-layered and multilayered, elastic and viscoelastic hollow cylindrical structures is then derived. This orthogonality relation is subsequently implemented to sort guided wave modes obtained from the SAFE calculation. Numerical results show that all the guided wave modes are successfully sorted. The mode sorting enables us to trace the modal behavior evolving with frequency for any guided wave mode. It also provides the basis for solving source influence in viscoelastic multilayered hollow cylinders.\nThe guided wave field generated by a specific source loading on a viscoelastic multilayered hollow cylinder is tackled by the employment of the Normal Mode Expansion (NME) technique. Different from the source influence in an elastic single-layered hollow cylinder, the displacement and stress continuity condition must be incorporated in deriving the amplitude factors of the generated normal modes. The displacement angular profiles of a certain loading are consequently obtained by the superposition of all the excited modes with appropriate amplitudes. After the angular profiles are obtained, the focusing deconvolution algorithm is incorporated to provide the amplitude factors and time delays for guided wave phased array focusing in viscoelastic multilayered hollow cylinders.\nTo visualize the focusing in a viscoelastic multilayered hollow cylinder, a viscoelastic coated pipe is taken as an example to build in ABAQUS. Finite Element Modeling (FEM) of guided wave focusing in the coated pipe is conducted. The FEM results agree well (5% difference in focal amplitudes) with the theoretical calculations.\nFinally, guided wave synthetic focusing experiments are designed to verify the theories. The guided wave synthetic focusing methodology and experiment procedure are introduced in detail. Data are taken on a steel pipe coated with 0.4-mm bitumastic 50. Four channel guided wave synthetic focusing is performed in post processing. Both the theoretical predictions and the experimental results show that the focal amplitudes under such a relatively thin coating are of less than 10% difference for the bare pipe focusing parameters and the coated pipe focusing parameters at the designed focal location. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3188], "author_name_tesi": "Mu, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Mu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Virendra Puri", "Samia A Suliman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Samia A Suliman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Guided wave", "hollow cylinder", "focusing", "viscoelastic"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Theory of Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Benzene Adsorption on Ag(111)", "id": "13319svm5300", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13319", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The adsorbed layer of benzene on Ag(111) is studied using molecular dynamics techniques.

Subsequently, the intermolecular interaction is studied and found to be dominated by substrate-mediated interactions, primarily the pairwise interaction between adsorbates produced by scattering of Shockley states. The z-dependence of these substrate-mediated interactions is derived and found to create noticeable difference to the order-disorder transition temperature of the adsorbed benzene monolayer. These substrate-mediated interactions are further validated by simulating high-coverage temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) spectra.

However, the underlying physical principles governing lipid organization remain unclear and there are very few experiemtnal tools to measure organization and structural properties on the molecular scale. In this work, the effect of molecular packing on some of the key membrane properties including bilayer thickness, acyl chain conformational flexibility, diffusive mobility, and electrostatic potential, and dynamics of DiI, was characterized using atomistic computational simulations. Lateral tension increases acyl chain interdigitation, and lateral/rotational mobility, and decreases hydrophobic thickness and electrostatic potential. DiI dynamics indicated that it is likely to be a good reporter for changes in bilayer fluidity. Combining the diffusion coefficient and fluorescence lifetime of DiI, the membrane microviscosity near the headgroup and tail regions was measured. Further, it is shown for the first time that fluorescence lifetime of DiI can report free-area in lipid bilayers to a precision of 1\u00c52. This property was used to measure thermal undulations in giant vesicles and nanoliposomes from fluctuations in lifetime of DiI. The methods developed here enable characterization of membrane mechanics, which may aid in identifying the role of membrane in endothelial mechanotransduction. Finally, a decrease in hydrophobic thickness induced by non-lipid amphiphiles was found to promote raft formation, and vice versa, emphasizing the role of hydrophobic mismatch. This finding brings a new perspective to how non-lipid amphiphiles regulate raft formation in cell membranes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2236], "author_name_tesi": "Muddana, Hari Shankar", "last_name_ssi": "Muddana", "middle_name_ssi": "Shankar", "first_name_ssi": "Hari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Butler", "Peter J Butler", "William O Hancock", "Cheng Dong", "Sulin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Butler, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Butler, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lipid bilayers", "molecular dynamics", "fluorescence spectroscopy", "membranes"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Dracula Immortalized in Sound: Discourse of Silence and Sound in the Original 1931 Film; Traversing Diegetic, Non-diegetic, and Temporal Soundscape in Philip Glass's Score (1999)", "id": "22680", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The 1931 film Dracula was part of Universal Pictures' growing portfolio of horror films. Despite a limited budget, uninspired treatment of Louis Bromfield's screenplay, as well as artistic indifference on the part of director Tod Browning, the film Dracula met great success in Hollywood in large part due to Bela Lugosi's hypnotic portrayal of the Count. Produced during the transition period between silent and sound film, Dracula contains very little music, delegated to only the opening credits and as part of the diegesis of the theater scene. Two months after Dracula premiered, Universal Studios released a Spanish version (Dr\u00e1cula) directed by George Melford. Able to view the dailies of the English version filmed earlier in the day, Melford aimed to improve upon Browning's film in both the visual and aural dimensions\u2014employing varied camera angles, lighting and more astutely-designed shots to depict a stunning visual space, while enhancing the aural realm through a greater range of sound thoughtfully put to use as part of the unfolding drama. The story continues when nearly seventy years later, the sound world of the original English-language film was enriched by the addition of a full score composed by Philip Glass. \nIn this thesis, I investigate the aesthetic and narrative implications of different approaches to sound design in the three versions of Dracula, using the original English-language film as a reference for both the Spanish-language and fully-scored versions. In Chapters 1 and 2, I provide a comparative analysis of the sonic landscape painted from two different vantage points\u2014that of the original English-language version and the Spanish-language adaption\u2014tracing conventions and techniques of sound design in early sound cinema. In Chapter 3, I provide a brief account of Philip Glass\u2019s approach to film scoring. Then, taking into consideration Glass\u2019s own views on sound-image correspondence in writing for film and visual media, I propose a model that can be used as a supplementary tool to capture the dynamic relationship between sound and image in film. In Chapter 4, I employ this model to demonstrate the dynamic relationship existent between Glass\u2019s score and the opening scenes of Dracula (1999), and alongside more traditional music theoretical and analytical techniques, explore how Philip Glass\u2019s score affects a more actively-engaged experience of the film.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9636], "author_name_tesi": "Mueller, Dorian Alexis", "last_name_ssi": "Mueller", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexis", "first_name_ssi": "Dorian", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Music Theory", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric John Mckee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric John Mckee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Philip Glass", "film music", "music theory", "diegetic", "non-diegetic", "temporality", "topic theory", "Dracula", "minimalism"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Conflict, Specialization, and Place Attachment Among North American Rock Climbers", "id": "13421jfm5607", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13421", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conflict in outdoor recreation is a topic that has been widely studied for over 50 years.

Many of these biogeochemical reactions occur in soils and are influenced by plants. Yet, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how plants shape soil biogeochemistry. The aim of my dissertation research was to improve knowledge of plant-soil interactions by studying the impacts of temperate tree species, and the characteristics that make them unique (i.e. plant traits), on soil biogeochemistry.  \n   \nMy dissertation research addresses multiple aspects of soil biogeochemistry, but from a similar starting point: evaluation of leaf-centric hypotheses and conceptual models. One such hypothesis is that evergreen and deciduous species uniquely impact soil nutrient availability. I tested this hypothesis using a meta-analysis that accounted for environmental variability by comparing only co-occuring stands of each plant type (Chapter 1). The results show that evergreen and deciduous species have equivalent effects on soil nitrogen (N) mineralization rates and dissolved inorganic N abundance. Plant types and leaf traits are also expected to influence soil carbon (C) stocks and soil acidity. In Chapter 2, I evaluate the influence of tree species and plant traits on soil C, N, and acidity at a common garden experiment. There, my research shows variability in soil acidity and soil C are tightly linked and species impacts on these properties are mediated by leaf and root stoichiometry, soil N transformations, and calcium cycling. The final chapter addresses the influence of plant traits and functional types on the composition of soil lipids (at the same common garden experiment). I show that the abundance and distribution of soil lipids is strongly linked to leaf and root lipid signatures. I also highlight novel differences in the lipid signatures of leaves, roots, and soils beneath evergreen and deciduous species. In turn, these lipid signatures serve as tracers of organic matter sources and stabilization. Collectively, the results of my dissertation research suggest a wider range of plant traits (e.g. root traits) and biogeochemical processes must be incorporated into conceptual models of plant impacts on soil biogeochemistry.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3386], "author_name_tesi": "Mueller, Kevin E", "last_name_ssi": "Mueller", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eissenstat", "David Eissenstat", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Roger Tai Koide", "Jon Chorover"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eissenstat, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Jon Chorover, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nitrogen", "carbon", "acidity", "leaf", "root", "litter", "species"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "METHODOLOGIES IN ASSESSING BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES", "id": "13548sjm5467", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13548", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Benthic macroinvertebrates have been used for over a century in biomonitoring. Biomonitoring is the use of biological measures to determine the state of or to evaluate changes in the environment. This surveillance method is commonly used as part of water quality monitoring.

The objective of this study is to compare entire collections of benthic macroinvertebrates collected by researchers in 2015 to computer-simulated data of subsamples of 100, 200, and 300 organisms. The computer simulated data represent protocols used by the National Park Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The Brillouin Index was calculated for each site and subsample permutation. An ANOVA analysis of the Brillouin Index by site showed that there is a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the use of 100 and 200 organisms with the Brillouin Index for 200 being greater. Additionally, the ANOVA analysis showed that 45.5% (5/11) of the time, that there is a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the use of 200 and 300 organisms with the Brillouin Index for 300 being greater.

These results indicate there could be valuable information missing from traditionally collected benthic macroinvertebrate samples for which DNA based technologies may improve macroinvertebrate bioassessments of aquatic ecosystems. \n\nSeveral recent studies have investigated the applicability of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI), 12S rDNA, and 16S rDNA for barcoding of various aquatic fauna including fish and aquatic invertebrates using artificial pools of individuals in the laboratory. Generally, molecular methods have shown an increase in taxonomic resolution compared to the morphological analyses. However, current limitations in barcoding primer design result in certain taxonomic groups being over or under-represented in the sequencing results. In addition, little work has been done to see how genetic based estimates of diversity based on sequencing of environmental DNA samples extracted from sediment or water samples compare to traditional morphological based analyses. This study tested 55 primer pairs targeting both mitochondrial 16S rDNA and COI genes. The COI primers, despite incorporation of numerous ambiguous nucleotides to facilitate application to wide taxonomic breadth, did not amplify several taxa tested. However testing of 16S primers amplified DNA missed by COI.  The results of this study make a large contribution to the effort of building up a robust 16S rDNA barcode database for aquatic invertebrate metabarcoding, through the generation and curation of 74 unique sequences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13614], "author_name_tesi": "Mueller, Sara Jaye", "last_name_ssi": "Mueller", "middle_name_ssi": "Jaye", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay R.

Impaired branched-chain &#945;-keto acid dehydrogenase in MSUD patients leads to the accumulation of branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine, as well as their respective keto acids. Buildup of these molecules causes neurotoxicity if left untreated. Although dietary treatments limiting amino acid intake are effective, patients are still at risk for episodic metabolic intoxication and impaired intellectual outcomes. Anecdotal reports have suggested an increased prevalence of attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety, but these symptoms have not been formally investigated or quantitatively described. Neuropathology reports, animal models, and in vitro studies suggest two potential mechanisms by which the underlying defect in MSUD may lead to acute neural sequelae: energy deprivation and neurotransmitter depletion. It is possible that these mechanisms also impact chronic sequelae. This research provides a unique neuropsychiatric and neurochemical profile of medically managed MSUD patients free of acute illness, offering insights into the mechanisms of chronic sequelae.\nLiver transplantation has recently emerged as a treatment option for MSUD patients, as the transplanted liver contains sufficient branched-chain &#945;-keto acid dehydrogenase to prevent extreme, rapid increases in plasma branched chain amino and keto acids. Liver transplantation has been shown to prevent acute neurotoxicity during acute illness; however, its effect on chronic sequelae is unknown. This research provides preliminary data on neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurochemistry in MSUD patients who have undergone liver transplant therapy. \nTwenty-six MSUD patients metabolically controlled with dietary therapy and twenty-six unaffected family member controls participated in the study. Prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions was assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Additionally, symptoms were characterized using continuous scales of attention, depression, and anxiety. Neurochemistry was quantified in three regions of interest: the medial prefrontal cortex and adjacent anterior cingulate gray matter (PFC+ACC), the left basal ganglia, and the right parietal white matter. Linear combination modeling was used to quantify metabolites, which were then compared between subject groups and correlated with continuous measures of neuropsychiatric outcomes. To begin to evaluate the effects of liver transplantation on chronic sequelae of MSUD, 11 MSUD patients who had undergone liver transplantation therapy were also evaluated with the above measures. \nConfirming anecdotal clinical observations, MSUD patients were found to have a higher prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions relative to controls. Average IQ scores were twenty-five points lower in the MSUD population (p < 0.001), although some patients exhibited normal intelligence. MSUD patients were twice as likely as controls to meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD at the time of evaluation (p = 0.04), seven times as likely to meet criteria for a current depressive disorder (p = 0.02), and more than twice as likely to meet criteria for a current anxiety disorder (p = 0.06). \nNeurochemical abnormalities were also observed in MSUD patients. Most notably, patients had lower glutamate concentrations in all three brain regions (p < 0.001), and region-specific deficits in energy molecules N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and creatine. Neurochemistry correlated with neuropsychiatric outcomes. Increased NAA in the basal ganglia corresponded with increased non-verbal IQ scores in MSUD subjects. Depression and anxiety ratings corresponded with decreases in glutamate and NAA in the ACC + PFC and attention impairments corresponded with multiple biochemical alterations in both basal ganglia and PFC + ACC. MSUD subjects who received a liver transplant varied in both the age at which they had received the transplant (range: 2.2 -22.4 years) and the length of time since liver transplantation (range: 0.2 \u2013 14.0 years). Transplanted subjects did not statistically differ from MSUD patients in terms of neuropsychiatric symptoms or neurochemical profiles. \nOur findings support the hypothesis that altered neurochemical pathways in the non-acute state of MSUD contribute to chronic impairments in neuronal mitochondrial function and neurotransmitter metabolism, which may contribute to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Altered neurochemistry in the basal ganglia appears to correspond primarily with outcomes related to psychomotor retardation, while functions of emotion regulation and attention were more related to differences in the PFC + ACC region. Our data in transplant patients suggest that liver transplantation, although highly effective for eliminating risk of acute crises, does not significantly impact chronic sequelae.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1831], "author_name_tesi": "Muelly, Emilie Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Muelly", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Emilie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott C Bunce", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Scott C Bunce", "James Robert Connor", "Qing X Yang", "Gregory Thomas Moore", "Julie A Mack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott C Bunce, Dissertation Advisor", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Chair", "Scott C Bunce, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Qing X Yang, Committee Member", "Gregory Thomas Moore, Committee Member", "Julie A Mack, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["branched chain amino acids", "leucine", "glutamate", "metabolism", "inborn errors of metabolism", "metabolic disorders", "neuroimaging", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "magnetic resonance imaging", "MRI", "MSUD maple syrup urine disease", "psychiatry", "IQ", "intelligence quotient", "mental retardation", "depression", "anxiety", "ADHD", "attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "RELATIONSHIP OF PLATELET ADHESION WITH SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY IN THE PENN STATE PEDIATRIC VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE", "id": "13787asm5360", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13787", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Between 1999 and 2006, 535 children died while waiting for a heart while 3,098 children were listed on the heart transplant list.1 In 2015, 385 hearts were transplanted in children; 321 children remain on the waiting list.2 As a result, there is a need for a pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD) as a bridge-to-transplant. The Penn State PVAD has been designed with this goal in mind; however, like all ventricular assist devices, thrombosis is a major problem that can lead to device failure, heart attack, and stroke. One possible theory for thrombus formation within the Penn State PVAD is the surface roughness of the polymer blood sac causing platelet and fibrin deposits. Penn State PVADs, explanted from ovine trials at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center, are analyzed for a relationship between surface topography of the polymer blood sac with thrombus formation. This is done by analyzing the same sac using three microscopy techniques. The samples are labeled immunofluorescently using an indirect method with anti-CD41 and Alexa Fluor 555 to label platelets and anti-fibrinogen and Alexa Fluor 488 to label fibrin and evaluated using confocal microscopy to determine if platelets and fibrin are present on the surface. The fluorescence structures are confirmed using environmental scanning electron microscopy. After all biologics are degraded, the surface topography is captured using optical profilometry with surface roughness parameters, such as root mean squared (RMS), roughness average (Ra), ten-point height (Rz), and Swedish height (H). Macroscopic clots are found only at the ports of the device, whereas microscopic deposits are observed throughout the sac. The surface under macroscopic clot locations are leading to higher surface roughness parameters than both microscopic deposit locations and control surfaces. The average RMS value for macroscopic clots are about 51% higher than microscopic deposits, and about 93% higher than the control. Similar trends are obtained for Ra, Rz, and H. To further the analysis beyond topography data, correlations between images captured with confocal, ESEM and optical profilometry are made to draw conclusions regarding the defects possibly causing deposits.

Three device layout strategies namely 1) Nested fin layout 2) Nested gate layout and 3) Double nested layout were studied and the nested gate layout was found to introduce the maximum channel stress of all three. Out of the three eS/D shape profiles namely 1) Rounded eS/D 2) Sigma eS/D and 3) Square eS/D, square shaped S/D regions are found to induce maximum channel stress due to minimum average source to drain distance making them the best candidates for nested tri-gate transistors contrary to the planar case. Strained silicon-germanium (SiGe) FETs being a potential candidate for future technology nodes, a comparison between Si and Si0.4Ge0.6 with Si0.6Ge0.4/Ge eS/D P-channel tri-gate FETs for the nested gate (5 tri-gates) based on average channel stress and corresponding mobility enhancements is discussed. Superior mobility enhancement of strained Si0.4Ge0.6 channel compared to strained Si channel offsets the disadvantage of the Si0.4Ge0.6 channel stress being slightly less than the Si channel. The evolution of the channel stress following S/D recess etch and eS/D re-growth for uniaxially strained SiGe fins obtained via global strain is also investigated to evaluate the maximum achievable stress levels for a combination of globally and locally induced uniaxial strain.

The MHCD technique thus developed was tested for the basic analytical figures of merit such as elemental detection and concentration, linearity and dynamic range and sensitivity to matrix effects. Analytical precision and accuracy, the two key factors, essential for analytical analysis were also evaluated. \n\nThe data from the MHCD are presented in two formats. The first is in the form of scaling factors that include both instrumental response and proportionality of signal to element concentration within a particular mineral.  This data is presented in the format of separate plots of scaling factors for each element, across the simulants.  By this cross-simulant comparison, variations in element sensitivity, i.e. signal per unit concentration, is viewed across the range of simulants tested.  This affords direct testing of potential matrix effects.  Such effects may arise because of different crystallography or bonding of the elements of interest within the different mineral components of the simulants.  If manifested, depending upon their magnitude, it may present limitations on accuracy of elemental concentrations or more broadly limit the ability to identify minerals based upon their elemental concentrations.\n\nThe second method of comparing the datasets from the simulants was by element concentration, as varied by simulant identity.  This comparison was aligned with standard analytical evaluation for signal linearity and dynamic range.  In this study the limits for each metric were set by the range of simulants and their corresponding mineral contents.  Apart from this fundamental analytical evaluation, a key reason for this evaluation was to illustrate the manner by which a sample of unknown mineral content would be compared to a database of known minerals for a particular experimental configuration of the MHCD-OES (Micro-Hollow Cathode Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy) technique.  Though the MHCD signal is the dependent variable, signal from an unknown sample could be inverted through the calibration curve to determine an elemental concentration, for each element.  The set of elemental concentrations so determined would\tthen permit mineral identification.\t\n\nNormalization of spectra accounts for signal variation with sample mass and change in intensity with time for any particular sample charge.  To be noted, both of such data comparisons include instrumental response factors that vary with wavelength, and hence element identity.  Therein as a mineral identification tool, the database and analyses would be specific to the instrumental configuration at this stage of development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [316], "author_name_tesi": "Mukherjee, Amrita ", "last_name_ssi": "Mukherjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amrita", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randy Lee Vander Wal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randy Lee Vander Wal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Micro-Hollow Cathode Discharge", "Plasma", "Lunar Regolith Simulants", "Optical Emission Spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Progression Towards Optimization Of Viscosity Of Highly Concentrated Carbonaceous Solid-water Slurries By Incorporating And Modifying Surface Chemistry Parameters With And Without Additives ", "id": "29572", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Carbonaceous solid-water slurries (CSWS) are concentrated suspensions of coal, petcoke bitumen, pitch etc. in water which are used as feedstock for gasifiers. The high solid loading (60\u221275 wt.%) in the slurry increases CSWS viscosity. For easier handling and pumping of these highly loaded mixtures, low viscosities are desirable. Depending on the nature of the carbonaceous solid, solids loading in the slurry and the particle size distribution, viscosity of a slurry can vary significantly. Ability to accurately predict the viscosity of a slurry will provide a better control over the design of slurry transport system and for viscosity optimization. The existing viscosity prediction models were originally developed for hard-sphere suspensions and therefore do not take into account surface chemistry. As a result, the viscosity predictions using these models for CSWS are not very accurate. Additives are commonly added to decrease viscosity of the CSWS by altering the surface chemistry. Since additives are specific to CSWS, selection of appropriate additives is crucial. The goal of this research was to aid in optimization of CSWS viscosity through improved prediction and selection of appropriate additive. \nTo incorporate effect of surface chemistry in the models predicting suspension viscosity, the effect of the different interfacial interactions caused by different surface chemistries has to be accounted for. Slurries of five carbonaceous solids with varying O/C ratio (to represent different surface chemistry parameters) were used for the study. To determine the inter-particle interactions of the carbonaceous solids in water, interfacial energies were calculated on the basis of surface chemistries, characterized by contact angles and zeta potential measurements. The carbonaceous solid particles in the slurries were assumed to be spherical. Polar interaction energy (hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction energy), which was observed to be 5-6 orders of magnitude higher  than the electrostatic interaction energy, and the van der Waals interaction energy, was clearly the dominant interaction energy for such a system. Hydrophobic interactions lead to the formation of aggregation networks of solids in the suspensions, entrapping a part of the bulk water, whereas hydrophilic interactions result in the formation of hydration layers around carbonaceous solids. Both of these phenomena cause a loss of bulk water from the slurry and increase the effective solid volume fraction, resulting in an increase in slurry viscosity. The water in the bulk of the slurry, responsible for the fluidity of the slurry is called free water. The amount of free water was determined using thermogravimetric analysis and was observed to increase with an increase in the O/C ratio of a carbonaceous solid (up to ~20%). The free water to total water ratio was observed to be constant for the slurry of a particular carbonaceous solid for various loadings of solids (44 wt.% to 67 wt.%). The increase in the effective solid volume fractions of slurries was determined using viscosity measurements. A relationship between the effective solid volume fraction and the O/C ratio of the carbonaceous solid was developed. This correlation was then incorporated into the existing equation for viscosity prediction (developed based on particle size distribution and solid volume fraction), to account for the surface chemistry of the carbonaceous solid and hence improve the predictive capabilities. This modified equation was validated using three concentrated carbonaceous slurries with different particle size distributions and was observed to significantly improve accuracy of prediction (deviation of predicted results decreased from up to 96% to 25%). The validation was performed with a lignite, bituminous coal and a petcoke-all with low ash yield.\n\tAdditives modify the surface chemistry of the carbonaceous solids, thereby affecting the interfacial interactions. Through this research, the effects of additives on the interfacial interactions and hence on slurry viscosity were determined. Since the additives used are specific to the surface chemistry of the solids in the slurry, this knowledge aids in the selection of the appropriate additive. The study was conducted using three carbonaceous solids with different O/C ratios and an anionic and a non-ionic additive. The adsorption of the additives on the carbonaceous solids, the change in the zeta potential and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the solids and the change in the free water content of the slurries were determined. The adsorption of the additives increased with an increase in the mineral matter content of the carbonaceous solids. There was also an increase in the zeta potential of the carbonaceous solids in water upon the addition of the anionic additive (up to ~30%). However, the calculated resultant electrostatic repulsion energy upon the addition of the anionic additive was 5-6 orders of magnitude lower than the polar interaction energy of the carbonaceous solids in water. Contact angle measurements indicated that both additives changed the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the solid surface (by up to 70\u00b0). This resulted in the release of bound water into the bulk slurries (up to 6%), resulting in greater fluidity. The increase in free water content of the slurries with additives was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). A correlation predicting the slurry viscosity on the basis of the weight fraction of free water in the slurries with additives was also developed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11907], "author_name_tesi": "Mukherjee, Amrita ", "last_name_ssi": "Mukherjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amrita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Mark Stephen Klima", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarma V Pisupati, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Chair", "Mark Stephen Klima, Committee Member", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["petcoke", "coal", "slurry", "viscosity", "interfacial interactions", "aggregation networks", "free water", "bound water"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SUPERVISORY DECISION AND CONTROL OF LARGE-SCALE MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS", "id": "12078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses the general problem of optimally controlling a large number of reactive autonomous agents under certain performance constraints.

On the other hand, the upper layer performs high level tasks such as planning, optimization and learning. The upper layer incorporates probabilistic supervisory decision and control on a lower dimensional manifold of the configuration space of the agents. The entire team of agents is modeled as a PFSA and control over the team of agents is exerted by varying the probabilities of state transitions in a continuous domain. For homogenous agents, complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the number of agents; hence, this decision and control algorithm is applicable to swarms of arbitrary size. Furthermore, the supervisory controller makes use of the asymmetric broadcast control paradigm, where all the agents receive identical instructions, although individual agents may act differently depending on their current states.

These videos may be processed to extract information such as the volume of traffic on the road, to track particular vehicles in surveillance videos, to measure their speed in order to get traffic flow details, etc. The videos may be obtained from webcams perched on traffic signals, at the side of the road, or even from commuters who can take these videos using the camera on their cell-phones. These videos may then be processed on the devices recording them, to extract the required information. However, real-time video is usually generated at 30 frames per second (fps). If the recording device cannot process frames at a speed of at least 30 frames per second, it will customize the video by reducing its frame rate and the quality of the extracted information may decrease (QoI). If the user has a QoI requirement that will not be met even by reducing the frame rate on the recording device, the video must be streamed to a more powerful server which will be able to deliver the desired QoI by processing the video at the required frame rate. However, streaming these video files take up a lot of bandwidth. At times, the desired QoI may be met by lowering the frame rate, which may allow the video to be processed locally, or streaming the video at the reduced frame rate to a powerful server if the recording device cannot process the video at the lowered frame rate. This saves bandwidth as the video was either processed locally, or streamed to a powerful server at a reduced frame rate.\n\tThe difference in the QoI arising due to the limitations in processing powers on various devices was analyzed. Videos obtained from various traffic cameras were processed to extract information about the number of vehicles passing by in a certain amount of time, the color of vehicles, the type of vehicle, and the speed of the vehicles passing by. The videos could be processed on a server (with higher processing power) or an android phone (with less processing power). If the QoI (accuracy, precision) requirement may be met on the phone, the video is locally processed. However, when a QoI requirement may not be met on the phone, the formulated mathematical models show that less than the original frame rate may be sent to the server to meet the same QoI requirement. This work implements a system that helps decide when the video file can be locally processed to get a desired QoI compared to when the video (maybe with a lower frame rate) has to be streamed to an alternate powerful server, thereby saving many resources such as bandwidth and the battery charge on the phone.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10078], "author_name_tesi": "Mukherjee, Manisha ", "last_name_ssi": "Mukherjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manisha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Thomas La Porta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Thomas La Porta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Real-time traffic video processing", "QoI", "Vehicle detection", "Vehicle tracking"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PORE-SCALE MODELING AND ANALYSIS OF THE POLYMER ELECTROLYTE FUEL CELL CATALYST LAYER ", "id": "8029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4939", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The catalyst layer (CL) plays a crucial role in the overall performance of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) due to the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction as well as transport limitation in the presence of liquid water and ensuing flooding. Nevertheless, it is often treated either as a thin interface or a macrohomogeneous porous layer and the influence of underlying morphology and wetting characteristics on the catalyst layer performance and water transport is ignored. The macroscopic fuel cell models, therefore, employ effective transport properties for reactant and charge transport as well as arbitrary two-phase closure relations for capillary pressure and relative permeability, the experimental measurements of which are exceedingly difficult and might be impossible in the near future. The role of the catalyst layer flooding in the overall cell performance and the mechanisms of liquid water transport/removal from the CL remain unexplored.\n\nIn order to reveal the underlying structure-performance relationship and to predict reliable closure relations, a pore-scale modeling framework comprising of a stochastic microstructure reconstruction model, an electrochemistry coupled direct numerical simulation (DNS) model and a two-phase lattice Boltzmann (LB) model is developed. The stochastic reconstruction model generates 3-D, statistically meaningful catalyst layer microstructure based on inputs from transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of an actual catalyst layer. Pore-level description of charge and species transport within the complex CL microstructure is achieved through the direct numerical simulation (DNS) model. The main purpose of the DNS model is to unravel the CL compositional influence on the performance and enable composition optimization for better performance. The mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann (LB) model simulates the liquid water transport through the CL microstructure in order to gain insight into the influence of structure on the pore-scale two-phase dynamics as well as to evaluate the two-phase constitutive relations in terms of capillary pressure and relative permeability as functions of liquid water saturation. A quantitative estimate of the detrimental effect of liquid water on the CL electrochemical performance in terms of the pore blockage and catalytic site coverage effects, which cannot be evaluated experimentally at present, is predicted from the combined LB and DNS models. These transport parameters can be used as reliable closure relations in macroscopic fuel cell models. \n\nFurthermore, a macroscopic model of CL flooding is devised based on a simplified structure-wettability representation and a physical description of water and heat balance. The role of evaporation in the CL liquid water saturation distribution and resulting flooding is elucidated. While the primary focus of the pore-scale modeling is to quantitatively estimate the transport parameters along with a detailed structure-transport-performance description, the macroscopic analysis reveals profound inter-relations of adjacent components and operating cell temperature with CL flooding.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4916], "author_name_tesi": "Mukherjee, Partha Pratim", "last_name_ssi": "Mukherjee", "middle_name_ssi": "Pratim", "first_name_ssi": "Partha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Long Qing Chen", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell", "Catalyst Layer", "Transport", "Pore-Scale Modeling", "Macroscopic Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Second Screens and Social Soundtrack", "id": "29575", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12666", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of second screen devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, etc.) integrated with social media technology facilitates social interaction about broadcast media events. I refer to such facilitation as the social soundtrack. The research presented in this dissertation deals with three research objectives surrounding the social soundtrack of Super Bowl XLIX, considered as the broadcast media event, on three social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr) on topical categories (commercials, music and game) at three phrases (Pre, During and Post). \n\tIn the first research objective, I perform statistical analysis on more than 3M, 800K and 50K posts from Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, respectively to evaluate the change of social soundtrack conversations regarding the identified categories at the three specified phases. I identify the predominant phase and category of interaction across all three social media platforms. Results show significant phase-category relationships for all three social media platforms. The During phase is identified as the predominant phase for all three categories on all social media platforms regarding absolute volume of conversations. Concerning predominant category identification, the game category is prominent in a majority of the social soundtracks for all phases, with the exception of Tumblr with dominant peaks for music and/or commercials relative to game in all three phases. \n\tThe second research objective evaluates the relationship between social media conversing and search (Google) queries, concerning commercials. The causality analysis step of relationship evaluation shows that volume and attitude of social media conversations directly cause the web search for the respective brands. The attitude of social conversation is referred to the average sentimentality aggregated over time.  Results also quantify the relationship social media conversing volume and attitude hold with searching volume for the set of brands on the social media platforms. I also find that more individual brands go viral in the Post phase, highlighting the potential impact of cross channel advertising effects.\n\tThe third research objective deals with 1) phase based significance on two content aspects of the social soundtrack (attitude and formality) among the three categories and 2) finding the relationship that these two content aspects independently have with different attributes of second screen interaction (volume of conversations, patterns used in social media texts, number of sentences, and number of unique words). From the perspective of significance, the results show that attitude score (i.e., average sentimentality) of Super Bowl commercials dominates that of other categories throughout all social media platforms in all three phases. However, when broadening the scope to the social soundtrack formality, it is music that becomes the emergent category in all three phases. Regarding investigation of the relationship that attributes have with attitude and formality, it is found that URL based recommendation and undirected broadcast pattern in social media posts has positive correlation with viewers\u2019 attitude in Pre and Post phases respectively, while undirected broadcast has positive correlation for Twitter and Tumblr with formality with the exception of Instagram where URL based recommendation has positive influence on formality in Pre and Post phases. The analysis shows that commercials dominate other categories in attribute-attitude relationship, but it is the music category that dominates in attribute-formality relationship compared to the other two categories in Pre and Post phases.\n\tEvaluation of the research objectives is achieved by quantitative analysis of the identified communication platforms during Super Bowl XLIX. The outcome of this research has potential to help retailers identify the temporal shift of conversations on topical categories related to In-Real-Life (IRL) events broadcast.

Australia, New Zealand and Colombia in 1980s and 90s, attempted a gradual phase out of quantitative restrictions by converting quotas to equivalent tariffs followed by a reduction in these tariffs. This was undertaken by auctioning import quota licenses and using the auction prices as a source of information for setting equivalent tariffs. In Australia, bidders (who participated in a series of uniform price auctions) offered to pay, not a price for the license, but an ad-valorem tariff in excess of the base rate, or the premium for short. These licenses were transferable and a few brokers coordinated transactions in the secondary market. When auctioning quota licenses, the authorities wanted to discourage frivolous bidders as well as ensure that allocated licenses were claimed and utilized. To prevent frivolous bidding, only registered bidders could bid in the auction. To ensure utilization and discourage hoarding, security deposits were collected upon acceptance of allocation.  These deposits were refunded when the licenses were used. The collection of security deposits may be seen as a harmless policy with the only discernable cost being the opportunity cost of the funds while they are on deposit. I (with Susumu Imai and Kala Krishna) argue in chapter 1 that, at least in the Australian context, this is not so.\n\n\tIn Chapter 2, I (with Susumu Imai, Kala Krishna and Ling Hui Tan) examine the role of middlemen (brokers) in an imperfect secondary market for quota licenses. Middlemen facilitate trade when markets are thin, as potential buyers and sellers find it difficult to meet and transact directly. However, in thin markets, middlemen also have the ability to influence the terms on which trades occur, and the wedge they create between the buying and selling price limits the extent to which they facilitate trade. We develop and simulate a model of middlemen in the market for quota licenses and estimate the reduced form of the model using data from an Australian textile/clothing/footwear quota broker. Our simulations show that both prices fall over time and are inversely related to the stock held by the middlemen. When availability outside is higher or when people do not value the license very highly, both prices tend to fall. When there is greater dispersion of  valuation in the economy, the wedge is larger. Welfare analysis suggests that the greater   heterogeneity leads to greater welfare losses. Reduced form regressions bear out the predictions made by the simulated model. \n\n\tChapter 3 explains the differential impacts of trade on countries in terms of institutional differences which result in factor market distortions. I (with Kala Krishna and Cemile Yavas) modify the Ricardian, Specific Factor and Hecksher Ohlin models of trade to capture these. Trade has both terms of trade effects and output effects. Both work to raise welfare in an undistorted economy. In a distorted economy, price effects work to improve welfare, while output effects work to reduce it. Large distorted countries are more likely to lose from trade as beneficial price effects are lower. In addition the greater the substitutability between goods, the more likely it is that welfare rises through trade\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [516], "author_name_tesi": "Mukhopadhyay, Abhiroop ", "last_name_ssi": "Mukhopadhyay", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhiroop", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Bee Yan Roberts", "Abdullah Yavas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kala Krishna, Committee Chair", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Member", "Bee Yan Roberts, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Middleman", "Market Structure", "Labor Market Distortions"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Tunnel FET based Field Programmable Gate Arrays\n\n", "id": "12004", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5347", "abstract_tesi": "The proliferation of mobile computing systems has created a new segment in the semiconductor ecosystem where energy e\u000eciency is the most critical design parameter.

The impact of TFET usage at the system level is characterized by simulating a FPGA architecture that demonstrate a signi\fcant reduction (\u0019 1x) in critical path delay at reduced operating voltages, compared to traditional FinFET based FPGAs at the 22nm node.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5342], "author_name_tesi": "Mukundrajan, Ravindhiran ", "last_name_ssi": "Mukundrajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ravindhiran", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Emerging nanotech", "Tunnel FET", "FPGA", "Low Power"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES AND ATTITUDE TOWARD INDEPENDENT LEARNING IN A HIGH TRANSACTIONAL DISTANCE ENVIRONMENT", "id": "7109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1066", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nIt has previously been theorized, but not verified, that higher degrees of transactional distance, and the engagement of a variety of the multiple intelligences, are each associated with higher levels of learner autonomy and independence.  It therefore seemed likely that learners who have successfully progressed in a learning environment that had both a higher degree of transactional distance and which engaged a variety of the intelligences (as opposed to just one or two of the intelligences) would actually have higher levels of learner autonomy, and subsequently demonstrate this through positive attitudes toward independent learning.  For these learners, it was believed that there may be a positive relationship between their strengths in one or more of the intelligences, and their attitude toward independent learning.\nThe Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS) and Adult Attitudes Toward Independent Learning (AATILS) surveys were provided to a sample of adults who all had experienced similar high transactional distance learning environments which engaged a variety of the intelligences.  Results demonstrated that these learners did demonstrate positive attitudes toward independent learning, and that interpersonal intelligence was predictive of attitude toward independent learning (p<0.001).  These results were significant in that they supported previous theories regarding the relationship of autonomy and transactional distance (Moore, 1980, 1983, 1993, and Moore & Kearsley, 2005), as well as suggestions of a relationship between the engagement of a variety of the intelligences with autonomy (Chan, 2000; Diaz-Lefebvre, 1999; Walters, 1992; and Williams, 1995) and independence (Cornwell, 2001; and Mantzaris, 2001).  The ability of interpersonal intelligence to predict attitudes toward independent learning suggested a dynamic relationship may exist between interpersonal intelligence, dialogue, transactional distance, autonomy, independence, and interdependence. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1056], "author_name_tesi": "Mulhollen, Christine Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Mulhollen", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Grahame Moore", "Gary Kuhne", "Melody M Thompson", "Mindy L Kornhaber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Grahame Moore, Committee Chair", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Member", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member", "Mindy L Kornhaber, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["independent learning", "adult education", "distance education", "transactional distance", "multiple intelligences", "attitude"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE ORIGIN OF EARTHQUAKE SWARMS ALONG THE EASTERN BRANCH OF THE EAST AFRICAN RIFT SYSTEM IN TANZANIA\n\n", "id": "9075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2033", "abstract_tesi": "The role of border faulting versus dikes in accommodating extensional strain in continental rift systems is not well understood. Extension during the earliest stage of rifting is thought to occur primarily along border faults while dikes likely accommodate much of the strain during late synrift stages. However, a recent diking event and associated seismicity in an area of nascent rifting in northern Tanzania suggests that magmatic process could play a more important role during the initial stage of rifting than previously thought. In this study, the origin of two earthquake swarms in northern Tanzania, the Manyara and KwaMtoro swarms, has been evaluated through event relocation, modelling of regional depth phases and examination of focal mechanisms. The data used in this study are from the 1994-95 broadband seismic experiment in Tanzania.\n\tFor the Manyara swarm, seismicity is distributed over a region 20 km wide and extends to >30 km depth. Hypocenters correlate well with the Manyara rift, and focal mechanisms of many events show normal faulting with nodal planes having the same NNE orientation as the Manyara rift border fault. This result indicates that the events are most probably caused by slip along the border fault and related other faults beneath the Manyara rift. The depth extent of seismicity shows that the faults extend into the lower crust.\t Seismicity in the KwaMtoro swarm is distributed over a region ~10 km wide but extends only to ~12 km depth. There are no mapped faults within the swarm, but a strong correlation between the N-S orientation of the swarm, the N-S orientation of nodal planes in focal mechanisms, and N-S striking extensional structures nearby, suggest that events in this swarm are also caused by slip on a system of rift faults. Results from a crack opening model are consistent with this interpretation. Our results thus support the view that extensional strain during the earliest stages of rifting is mainly accommodated by slip along rift faults.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2015], "author_name_tesi": "Mulibo, Gabriel Daudi", "last_name_ssi": "Mulibo", "middle_name_ssi": "Daudi", "first_name_ssi": "Gabriel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["East African Rift System", "Earthquake swarm", "diking", "faulting"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Investigation of Mantle Structure beneath Eastern Africa: Implications for the Origin Of the Cenozoic tectonism and propagation of the Rift System", "id": "15701", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7986", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It has long been debated whether or not the geodynamic processes of Earth\u2019s deep interior influence surface dynamics across the African continent. In this dissertation, I investigate the seismic structure of the earth beneath a portion of the African continent that has experienced Cenozoic tectonism, eastern Africa, to address the origin of the tectonism found there and determine to what extent the source of the tectonism lies deep in Earth\u2019s mantle. The approach used in this dissertation involves combining proven seismic imaging methods with new, extensive seismic data sets from eastern Africa. \nIn Chapter 2, I use body wave tomography to image seismic wave speed variations at upper and mid-mantle depths. Model results reveal a low wave speed anomaly (LWA) that dips to the SW beneath northern Zambia, extending to a depth of at least 900 km. The anomaly appears to be continuous across the transition zone, extending into the lower mantle, and can be attributed to a temperature anomaly of ~300 K. The depth extent of the anomaly is not easily explained by models for the origin of the Cenozoic East African tectonism that invoke a plume head or small scale convection either by edge flow or passive stretching of the lithosphere. However, the depth extent of the LWA is entirely consistent with a model invoking a through-going mantle anomaly beneath eastern Africa that links to the African Superplume anomaly in the lower mantle beneath southern Africa. Nonetheless, even though the Superplume model is favored, a 200-300 km separation of upper and lower mantle anomalies across the transition zone cannot be ruled out. \nTo further investigate the depth extent of the LWA, in Chapter 3 I image the structure of the mantle transition zone discontinuities using receiver function stacks. I find that the average transition zone thickness (TZT) is 210\u00b110 km across a wide region extending from central Zambia to the NE through Tanzania and into Kenya. This finding indicates that a thermal anomaly of \u2265300 K beneath Zambia and the East African plateau extends through the transition zone. The regionally thinned TZT from Zambia, Tanzania into Kenya confirms that the upper mantle anomaly beneath eastern Africa connects to the lower mantle Superplume structure. Thus, results presented in this Chapter, when combined with the results from Chapter 2, make a very strong case for the Superplume providing the primary source of heat to drive Cenozoic rifting, volcanism and plateau uplift in eastern Africa. This conclusion suggests that geodynamic processes deep in the lower mantle are influencing surface dynamics across the Afro-Arabian rift system.\nResults from Chapter 2 don\u2019t clearly show the direction of the rift propagation at the end of the Eastern branch of the East African rift system (EARS) in Tanzania, leaving open question of how the EARS will continue to develop. Therefore, in the third part of this dissertation, I have investigated the seismicity of southeastern Tanzania to better determine the southward propagation direction of the rift system. The results show that most of the seismicity (~75%) is concentrated in a SE trend extending from the eastern margin of the Tanzania Craton at ~5.25\u00b0 latitude to Stiegler\u2019s Gorge at ~8\u00b0 latitude. A lesser amount of seismicity (~25%) is found along the SE corner of the Craton extending southward towards Lake Nyasa (Malawi). This finding can be more easily explained by a plate kinematic model invoking a new microplate (Ruvuma) than a competing model linking the Eastern and Western branches of the EARS via a zone of active rifting south of the Tanzania Craton. The seismicity pattern therefore suggests that the EARS will continue to develop in a southeasterly direction across southern Tanzania rather than in a southerly direction towards Lake Nyasa and the Western branch.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7933], "author_name_tesi": "Mulibo, Gabriel Daudi", "last_name_ssi": "Mulibo", "middle_name_ssi": "Daudi", "first_name_ssi": "Gabriel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Charles James Ammon", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tomography", "Receiver function", "Superplume", "East African Rift System", "Cenozoic Tectonism"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Under Pressure: Star Clusters in the Tidal Debris of Interacting Galaxies", "id": "18256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8810", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pairwise galaxy interactions and mergers are commonly observed phenomena. The complex gravitational potential of interacting galaxies drastically affects their morphologies, producing long tidal tails and other galactic debris. Encounters between galaxies can also be agents of photometric evolution across these tidally disturbed features, prompting bursts of star and star cluster formation over the ~Gyr interaction timescale involved. \n\nAt extragalactic distances, we rely on luminous star clusters (M_V < -8.5;  ~10^4--10^6 M_{sun}) to trace the underlying stellar populations and star formation history of the typically dispersed, faint tidal debris. But decades of individual case studies have revealed that tidal tails do not appear to consistently have star clusters, unlike in the disks of gas-rich mergers. The question is why -- what is it about tidal tails that allows star cluster formation in some debris fields but not others? Is there some interplay of merging parameters, e.g., tail age, surface brightnesses, colors, gas densities, and progenitor mass ratios, that produce conditions conducive for these bound structures? Do the answers lie in the local densities and kinematics of the tail ISM? \n\nTo address these questions, I have searched for compact stellar structures within over 20 tidal tails in different pairs of interacting galaxies using the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). My collection of homogeneously observed tidal tails spans a parameter space of interaction characteristics that could allow luminous star clusters to form and survive. I first characterized and quantified the populations of star clusters within these tails and compared them to various global properties of the interactions that produced them. I also constructed indirect methods to compare the cluster populations and their imprinted formation characteristics with those seen in other extragalactic environments.     \n\nUsing archival data from ATCA, WHISP, and the Very Large Array, I additionally analyzed the turbulent warm neutral medium, the dominant component of the tail ISM, of most of the tidal tail regions within the sample. I examined the roles of ~kpc-scale HI densities, pressures, and kinematics in establishing the conditions required for star cluster formation on smaller (~pc) scales, and how these quantities empirically vary by the global tail properties I studied. In synthesizing these results, a rudimentary paradigm is now emerging, where the formation of luminous clusters in tidal tails depends largely on the turbulent character and amount of hydrogen gas in their local environment. These conditions are determined in part by how the galaxies interact and the ingredients they bring to the cosmic table.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8657], "author_name_tesi": "Mullan, Brendan Lawrence", "last_name_ssi": "Mullan", "middle_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "first_name_ssi": "Brendan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jane Camilla Charlton", "Jane Camilla Charlton", "Yuexing Cindy Li", "Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Eric D Feigelson", "Douglas Cowen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jane Camilla Charlton, Dissertation Advisor", "Jane Camilla Charlton, Committee Chair", "Yuexing Cindy Li, Committee Chair", "Caryl Ann Gronwall, Committee Member", "Eric D Feigelson, Committee Member", "Douglas Cowen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Astronomy", "tidal tails", "radio astronomy", "star clusters", "galaxy interactions", "star formation", "ISM", "turbulence", "photometry"]}]
