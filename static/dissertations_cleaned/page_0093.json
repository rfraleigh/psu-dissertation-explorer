Average annual costs of caring for patients with AD have been estimated at $80 billion to $100 billion in the United States.  Previous literature has identified several important factors that influence costs of care including symptoms, severity, age, and the presence of comorbid conditions. However, much of the AD costs literature measures total costs of AD in cross-sectional designs, and therefore cannot examine changes in costs over time. This study evaluates total costs of AD over time, as well as specific components of total costs (inpatient costs, outpatient costs and prescription drug costs). This study also evaluates differences in costs of care for patients with AD, with and without coexisting conditions. In this study, the aim is to extend upon previous research of US healthcare expenditures for AD, and estimate the effects of coexisting conditions on the direct healthcare costs of AD (total costs, inpatient costs, outpatient costs, and prescription drug costs). \nObjectives: This study aims to develop a predictive model for healthcare expenditures in the United States for patients diagnosed with AD. It investigates the magnitude of health care expenditures among privately insured individuals with AD. It will distinguish patterns of high expenditures within each type of care (outpatient, inpatient and prescription drug) and identify characteristics of patients associated with higher expenditures. Lastly, it evaluates the differences in costs of care between patients diagnosed with AD alone, and patients that have comorbid conditions.\nMethods: This retrospective study used 2008-2010 Truven Health MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and Encounters data to examine total and component healthcare costs per patient by year.  Random effects models estimate the effects of patients\u2019 characteristics (age, gender, region, and presence of significantly associated comorbidities) as well as year (2008-2010) on direct costs of care. Direct costs included outpatient costs, inpatient costs, prescription drug costs, and total costs of care. \nResults: Total direct costs increased 19.4% from approximately $1,871 per patient in 2008 to $2,233 in 2010. This substantial increase is attributed to increases in patient age and increases in costs across time. Annual outpatient costs increased 12.6% from $662 per patient in 2008 to $746 in 2010 among AD patients who used outpatient services. Average annual inpatient costs increased 2.9% from $7,790 in 2008 to $8,016 in 2010 among AD patients who used inpatient services.  Prescription drug costs increased 28.8% from $1,735per patient per year in 2008 to $2,236 in 2010 for AD patients who used AD medications.   The number of patients using inpatient services, outpatient services and prescription drugs for AD also increased from 2008 to 2010. Regression analyses showed the following indicators to have positive significant effects on total direct costs for individuals with AD: year, age, and region of residence (p-value<0.05). The regression analyses also showed that two out of the three comorbid conditions included in the study, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and chronic liver disorder, had significant negative effects on total direct costs, p-value<0.001.  Total direct costs, outpatient, inpatient, and prescription drug costs were consistently lower for patients with AD who had comorbidities compared to patients diagnosed with AD alone.\nConclusion: Total direct costs of caring for individuals with AD increased substantially over time. Increases in costs were attributed to increases over time, age, number of years from diagnosis, and region of residence. Gender was not significantly associated with total direct costs. Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or chronic liver disease resulted in significant decreases in total direct costs, which could be attributed to increases in costs directed towards comorbid conditions instead of attributing costs to initial diagnosis of AD.  Findings from this study will help healthcare providers and policy makers to better manage future costs of patients with AD. The implications from this study will show health policy makers that within the population of AD patients, there are specific characteristics that identify higher costs expenditures. It will also demonstrate the differences in costs of care specific to the type of care, and how to better prepare financially for patients with AD according to the types of services used. Lastly, this study shows a pattern of recording healthcare costs that may in fact deemphasize total direct costs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease when comorbidities are present. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8538], "author_name_tesi": "Peterson, Emily Nancy", "last_name_ssi": "Peterson", "middle_name_ssi": "Nancy", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas L Leslie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas L Leslie, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["healthcare costs", "Alzheimer's disease", "cost of Alzheimer's", "non-normal cost data regression", "public health cost data"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "nucleation, growth, and phase transformation mechanisms of the iron (oxy)hydroxides", "id": "24811", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10912", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The precipitation of akaganeite and its transformation to hematite under hydrothermal conditions was monitored using a combination of in situ and ex situ experimental techniques. Using synchrotron time-resolved X-ray diffraction (TRXRD), in situ experiments between 100 and 200 \u00b0C revealed that akaganeite was the first phase to form, and hematite was the final phase between 150 and 200 \u00b0C.\nA transient Fe-poor, OH-rich hematite phase with a chemical formula consistent with \u201chydrohematite\u201d was identified in our in situ TRXRD experiments at 150, 175, and 200 \u00b0C. Rietveld analyses revealed that water concentrations in the first-formed crystals of hydrohematite were comparable to water contents of FeOOH phases, such as akaganeite and goethite. Distinct peak splitting was observed in the 200 \u00b0C hydrohematite diffraction patterns, indicating a violation of the 3-fold rotational symmetry of S.G. R-3c. We present a new structure refinement for hydrohematite using a monoclinic space group (I2/a). To our knowledge, this is the first lower symmetry hematite-like phase captured with XRD.\nKinetic analyses using phase abundances derived from Rietveld calculations of TRXRD data demonstrated that the rates of akaganeite crystallization and dissolution, hematite nucleation and crystallization increased with temperature. However, in experiments with target temperatures between 150 and 200 \u00b0C, akaganeite nucleated instantaneously once experimental temperatures reached ~123 \u00b0C. Thus, the activation energy for akaganeite nucleation over the temperature range of 150 to 200 \u00b0C was 0 kJ/mol. The activation energy for the crystal growth and dissolution of akaganeite was 74 \u00b1 8 kJ/mol and 125 \u00b1 7 kJ/mol, respectively. Our calculated activation energies for hematite nucleation and crystal growth was 80 \u00b1 13 kJ/mol and 110 \u00b1 21 kJ/mol, respectively.\niii\niv FESEM and TEM characterization of samples heated to 150 \u00b0C revealed that two\nakaganeite morphologies \u2013 rectangular rods and spherulites \u2013 developed simultaneously. The first hematite crystals that we detected adopted the spherulitic morphology of the precursor akaganeite. These observations suggest that hematite nucleated heterogeneously within the akaganeite spherulites in our system. We propose that the transformation from akaganeite to hematite proceeded via short-range dissolution and reprecipitation leading to pseudomorphic replacement. The akaganeite rods persisted during the first stages of pseudomorphism, and in the final stage of transformation, the growth of hematite spherulites proceeded at the expense of the akaganeite rectangular rods.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10500], "author_name_tesi": "Peterson, Kristina Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Peterson", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kristina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney", "Peter J Heaney", "James David Kubicki", "Christopher Gorski", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Chair", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Christopher Gorski, Committee Member", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["akaganeite", "hematite", "Rietveld", "synchrotron", "time-resolved X-ray diffraction"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "INCENTIVIZING POST-PICS INTEGRATION IN OVERWHELMING UNCERTAINTY", "id": "19869", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9531", "abstract_tesi": "This paper intends to analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between the Emergency School Aid Act and the Technical Assistance for Student Assignment Plans grant program.

The 5 prime untranslated region (5\u2019 UTR) of the BVDV genome from BVDV was isolated from clinical samples by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PCR products were purified and sequenced in both directions using forward and reverse primers.

Phylogenetic analysis was used to group isolates based on similarity to known BVDV subtypes.  The conclusions of this study describe 5 subtypes of BVDV identified in the study population. The majority of isolates were found to be dissimilar to BVDV strains found in common vaccines for BVDV. An unexpectedly high rate of diversity of BVDV 2b was found in the study population and a diverging phylogenetic grouping from the BVDV 2b was identified as a possible new subtype of BVDV in cattle.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5277], "author_name_tesi": "Peterson, Ryan ", "last_name_ssi": "Peterson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Bhushan M Jayarao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Thesis Advisor", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["genome", "virus", "bovine", "pestivirus", "Phylogenetic analysis", "vaccine", "subtype", "clinical signs", "diagnostic", "veterinary", "1a", "1b", "BVDV", "2a", "2b", "mutation", "disease"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Reusable Spacecraft Command and Telemetry Storage Framework\n", "id": "9696", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5551", "abstract_tesi": "The problem of successfully managing the ever increasing quantity of spacecraft commands and telemetry involved in today\u2019s typical spacecraft missions demands building a standardized spacecraft command and telemetry storage framework that can be readily reused from mission to mission and that will allow for a broad range of applications, users, and data flow processes without requiring costly customizations.

As Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re\u2019s four heroes are perpetuated by cinema, literature, theater, music, advertisement and any kind of fixed image, they are maintained in the cultural environment \u2013they are known by all.  However, the novel contains never ending passages, its dialogues are sometimes excessively stretched, and the characters\u2019 defects are such that d\u2019Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis should be perceived as anti-heroes.  What are then the elements that allowed the Musketeers to exercise so great of a fascination over the public ?\n\nTo answer to this central question, the nature of Dumas\u2019 novel first needs to be determined.  The term \u00ab literary myth \u00bb seems to define it best.  Written for entertainment, the novel seduces an always eager public and it diffuses throughout time and space.  Despite many comparative studies, the confusion persists around the literary myth.  The latter designates a mythical tale that literature rewrote and maintained in the cultural environment, or a literary tale that the public transformed into a myth.  The incompatibility between the terms \u00ab myth \u00bb and \u00ab literary \u00bb comes into play, along with the question of the primary text, its validity and the importance of the narrative.  After having questioned the comparative studies, this thesis examines, from the perspectives of semiosis and perceptive semiosis, the production of the literary myth with the mechanism of the original text and the perception of the myth. It takes interest not in the narrative, but in the hero, who carries conventional invariants which ensure not only his fascination over the receptors, but also his mobility from one medium to another. As the dionysiac convention emerges behind the Musketeers, the myth of the Greek god is defined as a theoretical tool.  It is then possible to examine how it manifests itself in the heroes, and the way it is actualized by the readers.  Eventually, the study of the occurrences of the novel validates the invariants produced by the original text, the importance of the original text itself and the existence of a model reader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5258], "author_name_tesi": "Petit-Rasselle, Roxane M", "last_name_ssi": "Petit-Rasselle", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Roxane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Marie Grossman", "Jean Claude Vuillemin", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Willa Zahava Silverman", "Adrian Johannes Wanner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Marie Grossman, Committee Chair", "Jean Claude Vuillemin, Committee Chair", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Semiosis", "Perceptive semiosis", "Umberto Eco", "Literary myth", "The Three Musketeers", "Alexandre Dumas"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Numerically Efficient Finite Element Method Simulation of Voltage Driven Solid Rotor Synchronous Machines\n\n", "id": "8343", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis applies a numerically efficient finite element method to the simulation of a two dimensional cross-section of a solid rotor synchronous machine.

To address this problem, an extensive experimental program has been carried out on high-speed model jets, including both flow-field and acoustic measurements from pure air and helium/air mixture jets over a large range of operating conditions. Of particular interest is the study of the relationships between such complex mechanisms as nonlinear propagation, Mach wave emission and jet crackling. The latter refers to an annoying component of supersonic turbulent jet mixing noise that appears to be due to random sets of sharp compressions followed by weak expansions.\n\nFrequency-domain analyses indicate that there is agglomeration of energy at the higher frequencies as the propagation distance increases for both subsonic (highly-heated) and supersonic jets. The computation of an indicator of nonlinearity confirms that energy is transferred from mid-frequency range to the higher-end of the spectra, as a consequence of long-range propagation. Evidence of a nonlinear energy transfer towards lower frequencies is also found at supersonic jet exhaust velocities. Further comparison of the current results with measurements performed in a different facility (Boeing Low Speed Aeroacoustic Facility) shows good overall agreement. A very important result is the identification of the jet convective Mach number as a critical parameter that could possibly be used to predict the onset of nonlinear effects (more so than OASPL values, for example). The need for accurate values of convective Mach number constitutes the main motivation for the implementation of nonintrusive optical instruments in this work.\n\nAn optical deflectometry system is used to provide both qualitative and quantitative analyses in the jet shear layers exhausted from circular nozzles. Jet convection velocities and convective Mach numbers are determined from two-point, space-time, cross-correlations for pure air jets and show excellent agreement with data from the literature at lower speeds. However, helium/air mixture jets display considerably lower levels of correlation and notably reduced convection velocity values, in contrast to what schlieren photographs would indicate. It is very likely that visualization of the large-scale turbulent patterns in helium/air mixture jets is inhibited by the thick visual shear layer dominated by smaller scale structures.\n\nFinally, the time-domain data collected from both acoustic and flow-field measurements are carefully examined with the aim of clarifying a number of features associated with the nonlinear distortion of acoustic waves. More specifically, it is clearly established that the jet convective Mach number is a critical parameter that may be used to predict the onset of crackle in the pressure signals (and not directly nonlinear propagation effects). Overall, nonlinear propagation effects as such are estimated to be too weak to generate the typical shock-like patterns and waveform asymmetry associated with crackling signals. Considerable experimental evidence is gathered to suggest that the phenomenon known as \u2018crackle\u2019 may in fact represent the acoustic signature of the strong Mach waves radiated from the jet shear layer. Simple mechanisms are proposed to qualitatively explain how jet crackling can in turn induce significant nonlinear effects in the course of propagation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [860], "author_name_tesi": "Petitjean, Benoit Philippe", "last_name_ssi": "Petitjean", "middle_name_ssi": "Philippe", "first_name_ssi": "Benoit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Philip John Morris", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Anthony A Atchley", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aeroacoustics", "jet noise", "nonlinear acoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR DETERMINATION OF NOVEL GENES AND PATHWAYS REQUIRED FOR VESTIBULAR MORPHOGENESIS IN ZEBRAFISH\n", "id": "8576", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2496", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The vestibular system of the vertebrate inner ear functions to detect gravity and motion in order to maintain balance.  Functionally there are two divisions of the vestibule: the semicircular canals which detect angular acceleration and the otolith organs which perceive linear movements.  Each division, although structurally distinct, detects movement and gravity though the deflection of mechanosensory hair cells. \n\nThe semicircular canals are three fluid filled tubes arranged in different orthogonal planes.  Angular rotation of the head creates uneven flow of fluid through the canals and over the sensory hair cells that lie at each terminal, which can be translated to the brain via the eighth cranial nerve.  The otolith organs, including the utricle and the saccule, are each composed of a patch of sensory hair cells associated with an ear stone composed of calcium carbonate.  During linear acceleration, the stone, known as the otoconial matrix in mammals and the otolith in fish, serves as an inertial force for deflecting and stimulating the sensory hair cells below.\n\nCombinatorial expression of many genes expressed within the hindbrain and the developing otic vesicle induce proper morphogenesis of inner ear structures involved in auditory and vestibular function.  Dysfunction in these genes has been associated with deafness, balance disorders, and various craniofacial abnormalities.  Although some genes that influence ear development have been elucidated, there are likely many more that have remained undiscovered.  The goal of my research is to use zebrafish as a tool for the identification and characterization of genes that participate in vestibular development.  I have discovered several genes that are expressed in the zebrafish otic vesicle during embryogenesis, and I have shown that these genes are essential for proper the formation of vestibular structures.\n\nThe first genes that I analyzed were the two zebrafish orthologs of Pten, a well studied tumor suppressor gene that is involved in many human cancers.  This gene is known to control cell growth and proliferation through its negative regulation of the Akt pathway.  The zebrafish orthologs, ptena and ptenb are expressed during embryonic development, and their gene products are able to regulate the levels of phorphorylated Akt in embryogenesis. The two genes show distinct expression patterns, and predictably, knockdown of the individual genes also produce distinct phenotypes.  ptena, but not ptenb, is expressed in the otic vesicle.  Knockdown of ptena produces otolith defects at 24 hpf (hours post fertilization) and semicircular canal defects at 48 and 72 hpf.  Knockdown of ptenb does not affect inner ear development.  These results suggest that the function of one ancestral Pten may have been divided between two orthologs after the genome duplication in teleost fish.  I also conclude that proper control of cell growth and survival may play a role in the formation of these vestibular structures.     \n\nI have identified and investigated a novel zebrafish ortholog of a mammalian gene involved in otolith development.  The mammalian otolith organs contains thousands of minute biomineralized particles called otoconia, whereas the inner ear of teleost fish contains three large ear stones called otoliths that serve a similar function.  Otoconia and otoliths are composed of calcium carbonate crystals condensed on a core protein lattice.  Otoconin-90 (Oc90) is the major matrix protein of mammalian and avian otoconia, while Otolith Matrix Protein-1 (Omp-1) is the most abundant matrix protein found in the otoliths of teleost fish.  This difference in major matrix protein composition has been hypothesized to account for the morphological differences observed between mammalian otoconia and zebrafish otoliths.   Therefore, it was unexpected that orthologs for these matrix proteins would be found other species. I have identified a novel gene, otoc1, which encodes the zebrafish ortholog of Oc90.   Expression of otoc1 is detected in the ear between 15 hpf and 72 hpf, and is restricted primarily to the macula.  During embryogenesis, expression of otoc1 mRNA precedes the appearance of omp-1 transcripts.  Knockdown of otoc1 mRNA translation with antisense morpholinos produces a variety of aberrant otolith phenotypes.  My results suggest that Oc90 orthologs may serve to nucleate calcium carbonate mineralization of zebrafish otoliths, and that this protein is not strictly involved in determining mammalian otoconial morphology. \n\nPrevious experiments have shown that a zebrafish ortholog of Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (Ncs-1) is required for the proper formation of semicircular canal hubs in zebrafish otogenesis (Blasiole et al. 2005).  In order to gain further insight into the pathways involved in this Ncs-1 dependent process, I studied the role of Ncs-1 interacting proteins (NIPs) in vestibular development.  A yeast-2-hybrid screen was performed to identify novel NIPs.  Several of these newly identified and other previously known interactors were analyzed as candidates for otogeneic genes.   I determined that many zebrafish NIP orthologs are expressed in the developing semicircular canal structure.  Morpholino knockdown of three of these genes, arf1, pi4k\u00e2 and dan has demonstrated that these genes are indeed important for proper vestibular morphogenesis.  Combinatorial knockdowns have also been used to show that arf1, pi4k\u00e2, and ncs-1a functionally interact.  These functional interactions and direct physical associations suggest that these genes are involved in a unified pathway during inner ear development.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2479], "author_name_tesi": "Petko, Jessica Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Petko", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Laura Carrel", "Keith C Cheng", "Victor Alan Canfield"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Member", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["semicircular canal", "balance", "ncs-1", "otoc1", "inner ear", "zebrafish", "otolith"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Ultra-Wideband and Interleaved Polyfractal Antenna Arrays", "id": "8778", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3018", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, in order to successfully combine the positive attributes of both periodic and random arrays into one design, a novel class of arrays, known as fractal-random arrays, has been introduced.  In addition, global optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms, have been applied to antenna array layouts to provide highly directive, thinned, frequency agile, and shaped-beam antenna systems.  However, these methodologies have their limitations when applied to more demanding design scenarios.  Global optimizations are not well equipped to handle the large number of parameters used to describe large-N arrays, and fractal-random arrays lack the recursive properties needed to reconstruct their geometries exactly from a small set of parameters.  To overcome these difficulties, a new class of arrays, called polyfractal arrays, is introduced in this dissertation that possess properties well suited for the optimization of large-N arrays.  These polyfractal arrays possesss underlying self-similar properties that can be exploited to exactly reconstruct the array geometries from small sets of parameters and to increase the speed of the associated array factor calculations.  In addition, an autopolyploidy-based chromosome expansion native to polyfractal arrays is introduced that can dramatically accelerate the genetic algorithm optimization process.  This process allows the genetic algorithm to first evolve simple designs very quickly and then add increasing levels of complexity when they are needed to continue the optimization.  The entire procedure has been shown to be very effective in creating optimized large-N antenna layouts.  For example a 1616-element linear array can be optimized to possess a -24.30 dB sidelobe level with a 0.0056 degree half-power beamwidth.  In addition, robust Pareto optimization techniques can be applied to reduce the peak sidelobe levels at several frequencies specified over a wide bandwidth.  This procedure can lead to ultra-wideband antenna array designs, with one example discussed in this dissertation maintaining a -19.34 dB peak sidelobe level with no grating lobes from a range covering 0.5 wavelength to 20.0 wavelength minimum interelement spacings, corresponding to a bandwidth of at least 40:1.  These powerful array designs can be utilized as building blocks in robust, multi-beam, ultra-wideband antenna array systems.   \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3009], "author_name_tesi": "Petko, Joshua Stanton", "last_name_ssi": "Petko", "middle_name_ssi": "Stanton", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claude W De Pamphilis", "John Douglas Mitchell", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claude W De Pamphilis, Committee Member", "John Douglas Mitchell, Committee Member", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultra-wideband", "autopolyploidy", "genetic algorithm", "array", "antenna", "polyfractal", "fractal", "multi-beam", "interleaved"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A higher prevalence of iron depletion in eumenorrheic exercising women than amenorrheic exercising women", "id": "29586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12536", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exercising women are endangered to the health consequences of suboptimal iron status. At the same time, exercising women are also susceptible to declines in menstrual status associated with poor energy status in a condition known as the female athlete triad. Although compromised iron status and declines in menstrual status are common in exercising women, little is known about how these conditions interact in exercising women. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the effect of menstrual status on iron status in exercising women with amenorrhea (AMEN; n=36) and exercising women with ovulatory, eumenorrheic cycles (OvEU; n=28). As such, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of iron status markers (serum ferritin (Ft), soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), total body iron (TBI), hemoglobin (Hb), and hematocrit) and the prevalence of iron depletion (Ft <15 \u03bcg/L) between AMEN and OvEU aged 18-35 years who performed at least 2 hours per week of exercise. We investigated the relationship of iron status with menstrual bleeding intensity and menstrual bleeding duration in OvEU and amenorrhea duration in AMEN.  Exercise parameters and dietary factors were also assessed between groups and as covariates of iron status markers. The main findings were that the prevalence of iron depletion was greater in OvEU at 25% when compared to AMEN at 8%.  Despite this finding, no significant differences were observed between AMEN and OvEU for Ft, sTfR, TBI, Hb, and hematocrit. In addition, menstrual status characteristics were not associated with iron status markers or the prevalence of iron depletion. Exercise parameters and dietary factors were neither significantly different between groups nor covariates of iron status markers.

In the first essay, I analyze the effects of institutional ownership on liquidity risk in the cross-section of stocks.  Using a unique, hand-collected data set of hedge fund ownership, I examine whether stocks held by hedge funds as marginal investors are more sensitive to changes in aggregate liquidity than comparable stocks held by other types of institutions or by individuals.  After controlling for institutional preferences for stock characteristics, I find a positive relationship between hedge fund ownership and liquidity risk, and a negative relationship between bank ownership and liquidity risk.  In addition, stocks held by hedge funds experience significant negative abnormal returns during liquidity crises, whereas stocks held by banks experience significant positive abnormal returns.  These findings support the theory of Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) that funding constraints of leveraged speculators lead to a greater liquidity risk, and the theory of Gatev and Strahan (2006) that banks have a unique ability to hedge against market-wide liquidity shocks.  In the second essay, I examine the liquidity of global bonds.  Global bonds are international securities designed to be traded and settled efficiently in multiple markets.  I document significant differences in liquidity and transaction costs between global and domestic bonds issued by the same firms, and find that the greater liquidity of global bonds is priced.  These findings are consistent with microstructure models that predict a positive relationship between the number of potential investors and liquidity in over-the-counter markets.

This work is one of the first MD droplet vaporization studies done on a polyatomic molecule.  Inter-molecular and intra-molecular forces are incorporated using the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential.  Due to the polyatomic nature of C7H16, a torsional potential, which is a function of an internal dihedral angle, is also included in intra-molecular force calculations.  During each integration step the structure of the molecule is maintained by constraining bond lengths and bond angles iteratively.  The RATTLE method, a variation of the Velocity Verlet algorithm is implemented to maintain the constraints and advance the system through time.  The system is initialized in a BCC lattice with each molecule in a helical structure and is allowed to evolve into a random arrangement, using velocity rescaling to ensure that the kinetic and internal temperature is maintained in this initial period.  This rescaling is continued until the simulation has reached thermal equilibrium.  Due to the high computational costs of vaporization a polyatomic molecule using MD, a parallel implementation of the system has been developed. Four simulations were done on systems of 1500 and 3000 molecules under pressures of one and two atmospheres.  In all cases the droplet was initialized at a temperature of 293 K and the vapor initialized at 471 K.  Results of the thermal relaxation and droplet vaporization of these systems are presented. Cross-sectional contour plots were created for each case, looking at the translational and internal kinetic energy as well as the average forces acting within the droplets.  The evaporation rates were analyzed based on the Amsterdam method to determine the size of the droplets.

Bioabsorbable magnesium stents have therefore been developed, but clinical trials with stents made of magnesium alloy WE43 have shown that they corrode before the healing process is complete.\n\nThis thesis therefore proposes physical vapor deposition (PVD) as a means of fabricating nonequilibrium magnesium alloys with improved corrosion resistance.

Results showed that the PVD alloys exhibited superior corrosion resistance to WE43, especially after aging for several months to one year.

In addition, transformed A549 cells were cultured on magnesium alloys to assess the alloys\u2019 in vitro cytotoxicity.  Cells grown on WE43 were observed to demonstrate indeterminate or apoptotic morphologies, but cells grown on PVD alloys with low (< 15 &#956;A/cm2) corrosion rates were observed to be viable.

Block copolymers with an ionic phase and a hydrophobic phase represent one promising approach to improved fuel cell materials.  Despite abundant research on bulk membranes composed of ion-containing block copolymers, little attention has been given to swelling and conductivity in thin films (~10-500 nm) of these materials.  \nThin ion-containing polymer films play a significant role in fuel cell operation and performance by facilitating proton conduction between the catalyst layer and proton exchange membrane (PEM).  By lowering the interfacial resistance between the catalyst and PEM in a fuel cell, these films become a critical component in accessing the maximum amount of reactive catalyst surface area.  Typically, thin ion-containing polymer films are treated as having the same properties as measured for bulk membranes.  However, in thin films, substrate and air interfaces affect material properties.  The high ratio of surface area to volume in films less than 100 nm in thickness results in a large percentage of interfacial polymer with unique morphological, swelling, and conductivity characteristics compared to what is observed for bulk films.  \nWhen a PEM is exposed to increased water activity, or more commonly, relative humidity, additional water is absorbed into the film.  The morphological structure and polymer chain dynamics of the film may vary with thickness, which affects the rate of water absorption, the total amount of water absorbed, and therefore, the conductivity of the films.  To understand thin film conduction, the following points were investigated: the morphological differences between bulk and thin (< 100 nm) film polymers; the effect of film thickness and morphology on water uptake and dynamic swelling; and the interactions between the ion-containing polymers and the substrate.  \nThe microscopic structure before swelling, the change in thickness during swelling, and ion conductivity of thin films of ion-containing block copolymers were examined.  The initial morphology of the films in ambient conditions was established by atomic force microscopy (AFM).  Spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure the change in thickness and film composition in real time to characterize the dynamic water uptake.  Ion conductivity was measured using AC impedance.  The aim of this research is to understand the swelling behavior of thin ion-containing block copolymer films and to determine the fundamental water sorption phenomena and morphological features that may influence the conductivity of these thin films.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5490], "author_name_tesi": "Petrina, Stephanie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Petrina", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["swelling", "thin film polymer", "ionic polymer", "ellipsometry"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Water Sorption, Viscoelastic, and Optical Properties of Thin Nafion\u00ae Films\n", "id": "19021", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The hydrogen fuel cell industry continues to make strides in terms of improving device efficiency and performance, yet ion transport within the catalyst layer is not well understood.  Thin ionomer films coating the catalytic particles are responsible for proton transport throughout the catalytic layer, yet the basic physical properties of these thin films, which interact with the catalyst surface, are widely unknown.  Fundamentally, the material properties of thin polymer films are known to deviate from thick, free-standing membranes composed of the same material based on their interfacial interactions.  The work in this dissertation seeks to uncover the properties of thin Nafion\u00ae films to begin to understand their role in catalyst layer performance. \n\nBy identifying the influence of processing conditions, polymer\u2013substrate interaction, and thickness on water uptake characteristics of thin Nafion\u00ae films, the proton and oxygen transport parameters that are most relevant to performance in the catalyst layer can be understood.  Since the hydration of Nafion\u00ae is relevant for its proton conduction and performance in a fuel cell, water sorption of substrate\u2013supported Nafion\u00ae thin films was characterized via the change in sample mass and thickness as the relative humidity (RH) of the sample environment was varied.  Monolithic thin Nafion\u00ae films were characterized for a variety of sample preparation conditions and substrates to identify how processing conditions and other sample parameters may affect water uptake.  \n\nSpin cast Nafion\u00ae films exhibited low density and refractive index for very thin films due to the higher relative void fraction induced by rapid film formation.  The density of hydrated films was observed to decrease beyond the volume additivity limit as RH increased, and the relationship between density and refractive index was confirmed with the Lorentz-Lorenz relationship.  The complex refractive indices (N = n + ik) of substrate\u2013supported Nafion\u00ae films were identified for spin cast films 10 to 1000 nm in thickness.  A sharp decline in n was observed as film thickness decreased below 50 nm, and n was found to be influenced more by thickness (i.e. processing conditions) than the underlying substrate (Au or SiO2).  The spin casting process caused polymer chains to preferentially align parallel to the substrate, leading to an increase in anisotropy of the refractive index as measured by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry.  The incremental change in both thickness and refractive index was observed to increase more with greater humidity, especially above 75 % RH.  Chain anisotropy decreased as birefringence was eliminated when Nafion\u00ae was solvent annealed at high RH.  Spin cast films exhibited hysteresis in mass uptake and swelling, confirming that some degree of polymer relaxation occurs as Nafion\u00ae is swollen.  \n\nThin Nafion\u00ae films on Au exhibited a lower percentage change in mass compared to thicker films and Nafion\u00ae on SiO2.  Nafion\u00ae has been shown to form a hydrated layer at the interface of native oxide coated silicon which may account for the increased water sorption on SiO2 compared to Au.  Additionally, there may be significant interaction between the sulfonate groups on Nafion and the Au surface.  Mass uptake as a function of relative humidity was evaluated for Nafion\u00ae films 80 to 1200 nm in thickness.  By using two models to estimate mass uptake, the magnitude of viscoelastic losses were evaluated as a function of thickness and relative humidity.  As film thickness increased above 600 nm, the divergence in mass predicted by the Voigt and Sauerbrey equations indicated that thick films exhibited significant viscoelastic loss.\n\nThe significance of processing conditions in determining water uptake characteristics was evaluated by comparing adsorbed and spin cast substrate supported films.  Adsorbed Nafion\u00ae films exhibited different water uptake characteristics than spin cast polymer films, likely due to the structural differences induced in the film formation process.  Confinement at an interface constrained morphological organization for very thin films, which resulted in significant swelling compared to thicker films due to the lack of hydrophobic domains that reinforce the film and limit water uptake.  In summary, the properties of ionomer thin films are determined by the interplay between surface bonding and hydration, morphological organization, and mechanical properties.  The basic properties of Nafion\u00ae thin films discussed in this dissertation provide a basis for further studies of proton and oxygen transport in the ionomer phase in a fuel cell catalyst layer.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9040], "author_name_tesi": "Petrina, Stephanie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Petrina", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Ralph H Colby", "David Lawrence Allara", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Nikolas Podraza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member", "Nikolas Podraza, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin polymer films", "Nafion", "ionomer", "water sorption", "fuel cells", "spectroscopic ellipsometry", "quartz crystal microbalance"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ROLES OF LIPID RAFTS IN BOTULINUM NEUROTOXIN SEROTYPE A ACTIVITY AND DIFFERENTIATION \nOF NEUROBLASTOMA CELLS\n\n\n\n", "id": "8197", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3334", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT/A), one of seven serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin, is taken up by neurons of the peripheral nervous system.

Lipid rafts are microdomains that can be found on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids.  To determine whether lipid rafts were needed for BoNT/A activity, those associated with the plasma membranes of murine N2a neuroblastoma cells were disrupted using either the cyclic oligomer methyl-&#946;-cyclodextrin or the polyene filipin.

From permanent linear transects, samples were analyzed from multiple locations\nwithin a colony and some were re-sampled ~1 year later. Many colonies of Pocillopora (~\n53%) were dominated by a single S. glynni genotype and tended to associate with the same\nsymbiont genotype(s) temporally, while colony ramets often possessed unrelated symbiont\ngenotypes. The lack of correlation between host and symbiont lineages and the possibility for\ntemporal turnover of symbiont genotypes suggests that these genotypic combinations are\npotentially highly flexible.\nExpanding to S. glynni populations distributed throughout the Eastern Pacific, a total\nof four hundred and two multilocus haploid genotypes were acquired, of which two hundred\nand fifteen were distinct. Clone, or strain, diversity was high at most collection sites, with a\nsingle genotype detected in most samples (> 80%). Minimal population subdivision was\ndetected throughout the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) encompassing 1000\u2019s of square\nkilometers from mainland Mexico and Clipperton Atoll to the Gulf of Panama and the\nGalapagos Islands. The general lack of population differentiation over these distances\nappears to correspond with recent findings of extensive host genetic connectivity and\nindicates Pocillopora larvae, which maternally inherit their symbionts, aid in the dispersal of\nthis symbiont. Unlike a confluent host population, high latitude populations in the\nsubtropical Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) were strongly differentiated from the ETP.\nThe tropical (ETP) and subtropical (Gulf California, GoC) Eastern Pacific\npopulations of S. glynni were compared to Palau in the west Pacific, and the Gulf of Thailand\nthe Indo-Pacific. Bayesian clustering resolved several distinct populations (&#934;RT = 0.280, p =\n0.0001) including the previously described latitudinal separation between the GoC and ETP,\nwhich were well differentiated from populations in the west Indo-Pacific region. Additional\nstructuring between Palau, the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea was statistically\nsignificant (&#934;PR = 0.179, p = 0.0001). Latitudinal environments and large oceanic expanses\nappear to have structured S. glynni into genetically differentiated populations. However,\nseveral genotypes from Palau were similar in allelic composition to genotypes found in the\nGoC, suggesting that occasional dispersal may occur between east and west Pacific regions.\nWhile S. glynni associates with Pocillopora type 1 across the GoC and ETP, it associates\nwith a different species of Pocillopora (genetically-defined as type 5) in western regions and\nthis may in part explain the longitudinal differentiation.\nContrasting the host specificity and vertical transmission of S. glynni, Symbiodinium\ntrenchi (D1a) is a host generalist and horizontally transmitted. This symbiont differs\necologically from other genetically defined types within Clade D in that it is the most\ngeographically widespread, associates with a diversity of host taxa and in the Caribbean S.\ntrenchi has increased in prevalence and abundance in coral communities under prolonged\nexposure to raised sea surface temperatures. The unique ecology and distribution of this\nsymbiont prompted an investigation into its genotypic diversity and population structuring in\nrepresentative reefs from the Indo-Pacific and throughout the Atlantic using twelve diallelic\nmicrosatellite loci. Populations of S. trenchi from the Indo-Pacific were genetically diverse\n(I > 1.14) with most genotypes the products of sexual recombination (R > 0.80). In contrast,\npopulations throughout the greater Caribbean were limited in genetic diversity (I = 0.67) and\nexcessively clonal (R = 0.28). While no multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were shared among\nreefs in the Indo-Pacific, one unusual MLG was found forty-four times in the Caribbean and\nfrom every sample location except the Flower Garden Banks. Genotypic diversity is\ntypically high among other Caribbean Symbiodinium spp. suggesting something is unusual\nabout the population dynamics and dispersal of S. trenchi in this region. Severe thermal\nanomalies including recent events in 2005 and 2009 possibly facilitated expansion of a\nparticularly aggressive clone lineage and/or populations of this symbiont, which may stem\nfrom a small number of opportunistic introductions originating from the Indo-Pacific.\nData such as these on the population structure, genetic diversity and stability of\ncoral/algal symbioses are necessary for inferring the processes by which these symbioses\nevolve and respond to changes in environmental conditions. Most symbiont populations are\ncomprised of genotypically diverse and divergent individuals, with some symbiont genotypes\nfound numerous times on a reef and as a result of asexual reproduction. The one extreme\nexception was the Caribbean S. trenchi population, which contained low allelic diversity and\nis dominated by a single MLG or symbiont clone. The stability of a population\u2019s genotypic\ndiversity appears stable and the dispersal of this diversity controlled by environmental\nconditions and oceanic currents. While both symbiont species show the propensity for longdistance\ndispersal, it is believed that co-dispersing with its Pocillopora host larvae enhances\nS. glynni\u2019s dispersal, while S. trenchi must rely on its own intrinsic dispersal ability. Lastly,\ncomparisons between the genetic identity of Pocillopora and S. glynni demonstrate flexibility\nat the individual and population level. Although these symbionts are vertically transmitted,\nthe symbiosis is not fixed and individual associations can change in response to\nenvironmental conditions and chance events, providing the mechanism for symbiosis\nevolution. These findings highlight the complex nature and the species-specific patterns of\npopulation structuring and dispersal for coral-algal symbioses.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1566], "author_name_tesi": "Pettay, Daniel Tyler", "last_name_ssi": "Pettay", "middle_name_ssi": "Tyler", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd C La Jeunesse", "Todd C Lajeunesse", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Timothy Reluga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Todd C La Jeunesse, Dissertation Advisor", "Todd C Lajeunesse, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Chair", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Member", "Timothy Reluga, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["symbiodinium", "coral", "zooxanthellae", "population genetics", "clonality", "introduced species", "evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Radiative Heating and Cooling on Marine Stratocumulus Dynamics", "id": "10199", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2800", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We investigate the impact of radiative heating on the dynamics of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL).  Radiative heating computations through one-dimensional static cloudy model atmospheres show us that both longwave and shortwave radiative heating are sensitive to droplet concentration ($N_d$) and liquid water path (LWP) when LWP is low (${\rm LWP },<,20,{\rm g,m^{-2}}$).  For higher LWPs, longwave radiative heating is not sensitive to $N_d$ or LWP while shortwave radiative heating continues is sensitive to both quantities.\n\nWe used large-eddy simulation to study the STBL dynamical response to radiative heating.  Nocturnal LESs of the STBL are sensitive to $N_d$ when LWP is low and the free tropospheric air is dry.  Entrainment and longwave radiative cooling lead to lower cloud fractions when $N_d$ is high as compared to when it is low.  These low cloud fractions are associated with less longwave radiative cooling and weaker STBL circulations, and entrainment is able to suppress cloud growth.  In contrast, when $N_d$ is low and cloud fractions are not as low, longwave radiative cooling is large enough to support stronger STBL circulations and the cloud layer grows against entrainment.  We suggest that accounting for changes in longwave radiative heating with droplet concentration is important in simulating low level liquid water clouds.  When LWP is not low, changes in drizzle strength with $N_d$ mitigate differences in nocturnal STBL dynamics owing to changes in longwave radiative heating with $N_d$.  The dependence of longwave radiative heating on $N_d$ is not as significant for these LWPs.\n\nDaytime simulations of the STBL revealed that shortwave radiative heating affects the STBL primarily through increasing thermodynamic stability and this effect increases as solar zenith angle ($Theta$) decreases.  This increase in stability is associated with decreased LWP, slower entrainment, weakened circulations and strengthen decoupling of the cloud layer from the sub-cloud layer.  When LWP is not low, this decoupling is stronger for high $N_d$ because shortwave absorption is stronger and drizzle is weak.  For low $N_d$ a stronger drizzle process may aid in partially re-coupling the cloud and sub-cloud layers together through generation of conditional instability in the sub-cloud layer.  For low LWP, increased shortwave warming also leads to reduced longwave cooling.  This reduction in longwave cooling leads to even weaker circulations and stronger decoupling of the cloud layer from the sub-cloud than for STBLs with higher LWP.   Because entrainment is more vigorous and circulations are weaker for high $N_d$, low LWP clouds in the STBL are more likely to dissipate over the diurnal cycle when $N_d$ is high as compared to when $N_d$ is low.\n\nRadiative in the simulations described above was computed using the Independent Column Approximation (ICA).  We tested the impact on STBL dynamics of using the ICA in shortwave radiative heating rate computation by coupling a three-dimensional Monte Carlo shortwave radiative transfer solver to our LES.  Preliminary results show that the use of the ICA for shortwave radiative heating computation has a minimal impact on STBL dynamics.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2797], "author_name_tesi": "Petters, Jonathan ", "last_name_ssi": "Petters", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Jerry Y Harrington", "Johannes Verlinde", "James Kasting"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Dissertation Advisor", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Chair", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Member", "James Kasting, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["radiative transfer", "cloud dynamics", "atmospheric science", "meteorology"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "STEPFAMILY WORLDS: ETHNOGRAPHIC CASE STUDIES OF STEPFATHER-STEPSON COMMUNICATION", "id": "12044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3093", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contributes a descriptive base to the study of stepfamily systems in general and stepfather-stepson interaction in particular by describing six ethnographic case studies of how stepfathers and stepsons communicate social support. Research on stepfamilies consistently demonstrates that some children in stepfamily households are at a risk for academic, psychological, and behavioral problems, and that supportive stepfather-stepchild relationships help counteract these negative outcomes for youth. Yet, little is known about how support is communicated and perceived in stepfather-stepchild relationships. Based on a relational view of communication, this dissertation details how social support is communicated and perceived by stepfathers and their stepsons within purposefully selected stepfamilies.\n\nSix rural, middle-class, Caucasian stepfamilies including a stepfather, a 10-14 year old stepson, and his biological mother were recruited from social groups in central Pennsylvania to be part of an in-depth investigation into the communication of support in stepfather-stepson pairs. Data were collected across a minimum of four weeks with each family through qualitative field work involving in-depth interviews with stepfathers, youth, and mothers; eight, two-hour observational visits of family interaction in naturalistic settings; and, online questionnaires completed by stepfathers, youth, and mothers.\n\nAnalysis involved within case and cross case analyses of interview transcripts, fieldnotes, and questionnaire responses. Using a case study approach, within case analysis provided rich detail about individual and family level factors that resulted in a description of six distinct stepfather-stepson relational cultures of support embedded within stepfamily systems. Cross case analysis identified ways emotional, informational, and instrumental support was communicated between stepfather-stepson pairs and revealed six cross case patterns of supportive communication. Distinct from other families, stepfather-stepson support is influenced by interactions with nonresident households, such as stepfathers\u2019 biological children, visitation schedules between households, and comparisons between stepfathers and biological fathers. Findings suggest a model where stepfathers\u2019 motivation, experience, and social capital are communicated to stepsons through micro support messages that are encoded and decoded in light of the relational and family culture of support. Stepsons receive messages, sum them across interactions, and compare them against nonresident households in order to define and modify their perception of the relationship.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3082], "author_name_tesi": "Pettigrew, Jonathan ", "last_name_ssi": "Pettigrew", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle E Day", "Michelle E Day", "Michael L Hecht", "Jon F Nussbaum", "J Doug Coatsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle E Day, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle E Day, Committee Chair", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "J Doug Coatsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stepfamilies", "Social Support", "Fathers", "Adolescents", "Ethnography", "Case Study"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Teacher-to-Teacher Mentoring as Professional Development: Using Authentic Science as a Medium\n", "id": "7831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Contemporary science education reform movements stress the importance of the professional development of teachers as an avenue for facilitating teacher change.  Educational research on the professional development of teachers often focuses on the effect of hierarchical approaches on teachers enacting an authoritative perspective.  Little understanding exists about the professional development of teachers that is non-hierarchical.  This thesis explores teacher-to-teacher mentoring as professional development in the context of science research experiences.\n\n     The participants in this study were teachers involved in the National Science Foundations\u2019 (NSF) Teachers Experiencing Antarctica and the Arctic (TEA) program. This study examines meaningful interactions between three mentor teachers  (i.e., TEA teachers) that participated in authentic scientific polar research and twelve prot\u00e9g\u00e9 teachers (non-TEA teachers) that resulted in teacher change.  The research questions that guided this study were:\n\n1.  How do meaningful interactions among teachers occur?\n2.  How do teachers describe professional collaborations associated with authentic science research experiences?\n3.  What elements of interactions among teachers are meaningful?\n4.  Why are these elements of interactions meaningful to teachers?\n\n     Grounded theory was the analytical approach used in this study within the context of naturalistic inquiry.  Theoretical sampling required simultaneously interviewing participants, coding, and data analysis.  Data analysis revealed three categories that described the participants mentoring experiences: (a) actions, (b) interactions, and (c) engagement results.  Each incident of mentoring is an engagement that comprises participant action and interaction.\n  \n     The findings indicate that engagements that involve synthesis actions and dialogic interactions are meaningful to participants and result in teacher change.  These types of engagements occur when participants have ownership in an engagement.  The findings also suggest a cyclical relationship between teacher change and engagements.  Teachers that experience change to their practice may participate in further professional development engagements.

Using a contextual qualitative research approach, and the results of three research studies, I identify the set of information, situations, and interactions of lower-income women around pregnancy-related interactions and management.

These commitments appeared to serve a variety of functional purposes, albeit short-lived ones. When oppositional crowd identity commitments began to be seen as unoriginal, feelings of constriction arose. Those feelings, coupled with shifts in popular culture, increased school-based extracurricular involvement, and self-esteem, prompted a reconsideration of oppositional crowd commitments.

In most countries these maps are prepared by dedicated national organizations and are therefore available for most or even entirety of a country's landmass. The information content of topographic maps is shown either in\nthe form of graphics (e.g. contour lines, roads, buildings, and bodies of water and vegetation), or text (e.g. street labels, place names, and elevation data).\n\nWhile most new maps are generated using computer programs, the majority of existing topographic maps are only available as printed copies. The printing process combines the graphical and textual features into a single 2D layer and forms a complex mixture of heavily intersecting features in which the individual information layers are no longer readily accessible. Development of automatic feature extraction algorithms for map understanding systems has therefore been of interest for a long time. Map interpretation systems can be utilized in a variety of applications. The extracted road and contour lines can be used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in order to update an existing map. Since topographic maps are accurately geo-referenced, these layers can also be used in conflation with satellite imagery to obtain a single integrated map. Additionally, the extracted text can be used to classify or search for maps that contain the name of a particular street, area, or city in a database of map images, or to add such information to satellite imagery. Furthermore, the elevation data can be used in conjunction with the extracted contour lines in order to create 3D digital elevation models.\nIn this dissertation we focus on the development of a system for automatic extraction of various graphical features and recognition of the text content of scanned topographic maps. The input to this system is the image of a scanned topographic map, and the output consists of each of the various graphical features extracted as separate layers and the recognized text. This system has been designed such that heuristics are not used, user interaction is limited only to a supervisory capacity, and the need for prior knowledge about the map images is minimal. Furthermore, we have tested our system extensively on the difficult class of United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps which contain dense and regularly overlapping features, and use the same color for linear features, text, and buildings.\n\nThe challenges encountered in the separation of the text and graphics in maps can be divided into two categories. The first group of challenges result from the scanning process, and consist of artifacts caused by blurring, aliasing, and mixing of colors of adjacent pixels. Topographic maps mainly consist of very thin linear features such as contour lines and road lines that are easily affected by the blending of colors across the pixels of intersecting features and erosion of the edges. Hence unlike other printed documents, the impact of the scanning artifacts cannot be overlooked here. The main challenge in separating the graphical and textual elements however emanates from the heavy intersection and overlapping of features as they increase the likelihood of classification errors.\n\nGraphical features are in general more tolerant to extraction errors. On the other hand, the text content of maps is far more sensitive to defects since any quality degradation has a negative impact on the recognition rate of the extracted text. Misclassification of text as graphics results in partial or complete loss of character segments, while graphics segments that are not properly detected produce hard to recognize and/or conjoined characters. In addition to the difficulties associated with the large amount of noise and defects, recognition of the text content of maps is further complicated due to the fact that many of the extracted words have arbitrary orientation and/or are curvilinear and thus need to be properly processed before being sent for recognition.\n\nOur proposed map understanding system has been designed to overcome each of the aforementioned challenges. This system consists of two main stages: text and graphics separation, followed by text recognition. The contour lines are first extracted using a novel false color technique that aims to decrease the intra-class variance of the colors of contour pixels. The main contribution of our text/graphics separation unit however is our linear feature extraction algorithm which uses a new line representation method based on directional morphological filtering to extract features with arbitrary orientation and curvature such as roads and boundary lines, even when they are intersecting with the text. Once the linear features are removed, we use a series of algorithms to remove the remaining non-character objects, group the characters into their respective strings, and reorient the text to the horizontal direction.\n\nCommercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are primarily designed for noise free office documents and their performance deteriorates significantly in the presence of less than ideal conditions. We have therefore developed a custom multi-font segmentation-free OCR that combines the outputs of two sets of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and bigram and character width probabilities to recognize the text. A specially designed defect model that closely mimics the artifacts encountered in text extracted from maps is used to artificially generate the training sets required for each character. Another novel aspect of the recognition engine is a preprocessing algorithm that uses RANSAC to automatically eliminate some of the artifacts attached to the characters, and/or properly normalize every extracted word image in order to improve the recognition rate.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [530], "author_name_tesi": "Pezeshk, Aria ", "last_name_ssi": "Pezeshk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Laurence Tutwiler", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "William Evan Higgins", "Robert Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "Robert Collins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["image processing", "document recognition", "mathematical morphology", "text recognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Computational Fluid Dynamic Analysis of AxWJ-2 Propulsor Cavitation Breakdown\n", "id": "11559", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1268", "abstract_tesi": "For waterjet systems operating in marine ships, cavitation is a phenomenon that often occurs.

Emerging research in human-computer interaction (HCI) suggests that these accidents may also be attributed to errors in system design, particularly those features which fail to account for user frustration, anxiety, stress, and boredom.\n\nOverlapping findings in the stress and emotion research literatures suggest possible interactions between mood states and stressors in terms of their joint impact on cognitive task performance. This research explored these effects further in the context of group task performance.\n\nThis research extended the NeoCITIES simulation, a simulated task environment (STE) based around the context of geo-collaborative crisis management, to run team-based human subject experiments designed to explore possible mediating or moderating effects of positive and negative moods on the complex relationship between stress and distributed decision making. These effects were assessed in terms of multiple dimensions of task performance including timeliness and accuracy of resource allocation tasks and content analysis of communications data.\n\nThese effects were investigated in two similar experiments, each applying a qualitatively different stressor to teams in happy and sad mood states across a series of within-subjects trials. Performance data, self-reported mood and stress measures, and team communications were analyzed for interactions between mood and stress. The first experiment revealed evidence that negative affect mediated the impact of a task load stressor on team task performance. In the second experiment, the negative mood manipulation diminished team perspective to the extent\nthat participants were unmotivated by a team-level performance pressure stressor. Additional findings provided insight into multiple main effects and interactions between mood and stress on specific communication behaviors and perceptions of within-team cooperation.\n\nContributions of this study include extensions to the theories relating moods, stress, and team cognition. Among these are demonstrations of both mediation and moderation of stressors by mood states and additional evidence of the orthogonality of positive and negative affect. Methodological advances were made through the development of a new chat coding scheme to analyze within-team behaviors. The study also led to the development of a robust experimental platform for reliably implementing and automating complex psychological manipulations and measures in a team-based simulated task environment. Together these aid in the development of additional studies on team cognition as well as suggest new concerns in the design of systems use in team decision making under stress.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4336], "author_name_tesi": "Pfaff, Mark Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Pfaff", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael David Mcneese", "David J Hall", "Xiaolong Zhang", "S.

The research questions examined how high school principals perceive the use of other measures, standardized tests, and high stakes tests as they relate to the academic achievement for Navajo high school students.  The research also included principals\u2019 perceptions that were different or the same for the special education high school student in their school.\nMethodology\nThis was a qualitative multi-case study of three high school principals at a Bureau of Indian Affairs school, a grant school, and a public school located on the Navajo Nation reservation in Arizona.  The researcher conducted open-ended interviews with each high school principal, carried out daily principal observations, collected data from individual schools and lead teacher focus group interviews as one means to triangulate data.\nFindings\n\tStudy resulted in the following findings: The high school principal on the Navajo reservation is influenced greatly by the federal act of No Child Left Behind. The Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards (AIMS), was identified as the high stakes test for these three schools. The AIMS is a challenge for many Navajo high school students to meet, and places many students in jeopardy of not graduating with a diploma, and schools not making Adequate Yearly Progress.   Navajo language and culture in the schools is based on the school administration, communities wants and needs and is either integrated or seen as extra-curricular in relationship to the regular high school curriculum.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6339], "author_name_tesi": "Pfeiffer, Tamarah ", "last_name_ssi": "Pfeiffer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tamarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John W Tippeconnic Iii", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John W Tippeconnic Iii, Committee Chair", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["principals", "academic achievement", "Navajo", "american indian", "special education", "high school"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Resistance to sterol-demethylation inhibiting fungicides in populations of Venturia inaequalis from Pennsylvania apple orchards\n", "id": "11025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1752", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Apple scab, caused by Venturia inaequalis, is the most economically important fungal disease of apple in the eastern United States. Over the past 25 years, apple growers have relied on sterol demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicides for scab control, but reduced efficacy has recently been noted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of V. inaequalis isolates from Pennsylvania to DMI fungicides. In 2008 and 2009, leaves and immature fruit with scab symptoms were collected from 20 commercial orchards. Growers provided management history of the sampled plots. A total of 479 single-spore cultures were isolated from the tissues and maintained individually. Each isolate was tested for sensitivity to DMI fungicides on 1/4-strength PDA plates amended with a range of concentrations of myclobutanil, fenbuconazole, or difenoconazole. Mean effective concentration for 50% inhibition (EC50) values of each fungicide were calculated for populations from 14 orchards. Relative growth (RG) values were calculated and isolates with RG > 75 on plates amended with 0.5 &#61549;g/mL, were scored as resistant to the particular fungicide. Widespread shifts toward resistance to the three DMI fungicides were noted with EC50 values of 2.139 &#61617; 0.090 (mean &#61617; standard error), 0.839 &#61617; 0.053 and 0.158 &#61617; 0.008, for myclobutanil, fenbuconazole, and difenoconazole, respectively. Based on a 0.5 &#61549;g/mL threshold, 64% of isolates were resistant to myclobutanil, and 24% were resistant to fenbuconazole. Less than 1% of the isolates were cross-resistant to all three fungicides, but 22% were cross-resistant to myclobutanil and fenbuconazole. Failure to use dormant copper sprays, older trees, larger orchards, orchards comprised of ten or more cultivars, mixed-cultivar orchards, and isolates from the \u2018York Imperial\u2019 cultivar were positively correlated (0.0001 < P < 0.05) with the incidence of resistant isolates. Isolates from orchards that were not treated with copper were twice as likely to be resistant to myclobutanil (odds ratio = 2.015; P = 0.0009). Growers can focus on using management practices, particularly dormant copper sprays, to reduce their risk of developing resistance to DMI fungicides.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1738], "author_name_tesi": "Pfeufer, Emily E.

Even with increasing acreage of onions in PA, consumer demands for the crop are not met by current production. Bacterial rots of onion are the most significant diseases reducing harvest and storage yields of the crop, in some instances diminishing marketable yields by 60%. Growers manage bacterial rots of onion through combinations of chemical and cultural practices, including copper fungicides, plastic mulch, and drip irrigation; however, yields remain variable between seasons and farms. These producers are interested in alternative practices, including plant defense-inducing treatments, carefully planned applications of fertilizer during drip irrigation (fertigation), and targeted insect management for more consistent control of bacterial diseases, however, data is lacking on the effectiveness of these practices in PA. The ultimate goal of the following research is to contribute additional integrated management tools to the existing grower knowledge base to increase the profitability of growing onions in PA. \nAs a relatively new pathosystem in PA, basic and applied research was conducted in order to better understand the impact of bacterial rots on marketable yield of onion in the state. The principal bacterial pathogens were identified as Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas marginalis pv. marginalis. Sources of bacterial inoculum, including soil, transplants, and weeds, were elucidated in addition to investigation of ecological interactions between these species, their hosts, and the cropping system. Aspects of the production system are suggested to affect plant disease in both pathogen- and disease-specific ways, such as the association of black plastic mulch with increased detection of P. agglomerans, and early-season soil nitrate resulting in decreased detections of leaf pathogens. On-farm management factors as observed in PA and New York indicate that higher incidences of bacterial rots of onion are associated with low foliar nitrogen and high soil temperatures near the physiological onset of bulbing. Replicated field trials in which plant defense-inducing and growth-promoting compounds were compared for their efficacy in managing center rot of onion (Pantoea ananatis and P. agglomerans) indicated moderate disease incidence among all treatments, including the copper-based grower standard treatment, which was only effective at low levels of inoculum pressure. Comparisons of the source and timing of nitrogen fertilizer application were completed in a replicated field study, and one year of data suggests an association between late-season fertilizer application and higher incidence of center rot. In addition, data were generated in an effort to understand the role of thrips in the epidemiology of center rot disease. Taken together, these datasets have increased the overall knowledge about the bacterial rot \u2013 onion pathosystem in Pennsylvania, elucidated management practices that hold promise for future replicated study, and improved management of bacterial rots of onion, particularly through dissemination of research results to growers during extension presentations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9951], "author_name_tesi": "Pfeufer, Emily E.

The industry has been dominated by the design of concrete members reinforced with steel bars having specified yield strength of 60 ksi (Grade 60) and exhibiting a well-defined yield point. A series of experiments was designed to investigate the cyclic response of reinforced concrete beams reinforced longitudinally with ASTM A1035 Grade-120 steel (UHSS without a sharp yield point).\nFour specimens, designed with similar flexural strengths, were subjected to displacement reversals of increasing amplitude. One specimen was reinforced with conventional Grade-60 steel bars to serve as a control specimen, two were constructed with Grade-120 bars, and one incorporated Grade-97 bars (UHSS with a sharp yield point). All transverse steel hoops were Grade-60 steel. Other variables included the volume fraction of hooked steel fibers (0 or 1.5%) and the spacing of the transverse hoops (d/4 or d/2). The nominal concrete strength was 6000 psi for all specimens.\nAll of the tested beams completed the cyclic loading protocol, which targeted a maximum drift ratio of 5%. The calculated yield moment and ultimate moment, using conventional assumptions in strength design, resulted in values within 10% of measured ones. The test data indicate that, for reinforced concrete and high performance fiber reinforced concrete beams, replacing conventional Grade-60 longitudinal reinforcement with reduced amounts of Grade-97 or Grade-120 steel bars attained the target flexural strength and deformation capacity. \nThe evidence presented suggests that the use of ASTM A1035 steel bars as longitudinal reinforcement is a viable option for seismic applications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7765], "author_name_tesi": "Pfund, Stephen Jacob", "last_name_ssi": "Pfund", "middle_name_ssi": "Jacob", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Andres Lepage", "Ali M Memari", "Richard A Behr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Andres Lepage, Thesis Advisor", "Ali M Memari, Thesis Advisor", "Richard A Behr, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["advanced high strength steel", "crack width", "deformation capacity", "high performance fiber reinforced concrete", "ultrahigh strength"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Women's Status in the Course of Reform in Vietnam\n\n", "id": "9066", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study explored women\u2019s status during the course of reform in Vietnam using data from the Census, the Vietnam Living Standard Survey and the Vietnam Demographic and Health Survey.

Employment earnings provide financial contributions to the household, enhance women\u2019s bargaining power, and contribute to their self-esteem. In transitional economies, like Vietnam, the initial stages of economic development often involve industries targeting women, namely light manufacturing like garments and textiles. However, in rural areas, where the majority of Vietnam\u2019s population resides, paid employment is not easily accessible. Even after entering the labor market, women are disadvantaged in pay, promotion, and benefits. Examining women\u2019s employment and wages in Vietnam is particularly significant because the transition from a centrally planned socialist economy to a free-market based system may mean women are losing ground as protections afforded to them under socialism are removed.\nMy dissertation is comprised of two studies. In \u201cMultilevel Correlates of Women\u2019s Salaried Employment in Rural Vietnam,\u201d I use multi-level logistic regression analyses to examine commune level and individual level variables that influence women\u2019s wage labor. Using data from the 2012 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (n_individual = 5155, N_cummune = 1645), I find support for structural explanations for women\u2019s employment. Communes that have a higher per capita number of poor households decrease women\u2019s chances of working, especially among highly educated women. Individual factors associated with women\u2019s employment include education, being married, the number of small children, and non-earned income. While better education increases employment probabilities, being married, having young children, and increased non-earned income decrease employment probabilities. Prior studies on multilevel determinants of women\u2019s employment have mainly focused on the country as the macro level and individual as the micro level, leaving middle level community characteristics unexamined. Thus, this paper fills an important research gap by including middle level factors, and the findings are directly relevant to government economic development programs and policies.\nThe second study, \u201cHow Did Women Fare in Vietnam\u2019s Labor Market during Economic Reform?\u201d uses the Mincerian earnings equations and Oaxaca decomposition methods to examine female returns to education and the gender wage gap during Vietnam\u2019s intensive economic reform process. Using interaction terms between ownership type and time, the paper tests the effects of reform timing on female labor status. For this study, I use data from three waves of the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey: 1992, 2002, and 2012. This two decade time span captures a more complete trend than previous studies in terms of returns to education and the gender wage gap during Vietnam\u2019s long reform process. Results indicate that women had higher levels of education and enjoyed higher returns to education than did men during 1992-2012. However, the gender wage gap, which decreased during 1992-2002, began to increase during 2002-2012. Additionally, more than 100 percent of the gender wage gap during the second period was attributed to differences in how males and females were treated in the labor market. These findings stress the importance of Vietnam\u2019s continual efforts in promoting reform programs that ensure gender equality and a level playing field in the labor market so that earned wages accurately reflect human capital. In particular, the increasing gender wage gap in the second economic period highlights the value of not completely abandoning socialist policies that emphasized women\u2019s equality in the newly adopted free market system. Specifically, future policies should focus on the effective banning of any kinds of discrimination against women in recruitment, pay, and promotion.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11631], "author_name_tesi": "Pham, Phuong Thi Thu", "last_name_ssi": "Pham", "middle_name_ssi": "Thi Thu", "first_name_ssi": "Phuong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody", "David Eggebeen", "D Wayne Osgood", "David Shapiro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rukmalie Thalani Jayakody, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eggebeen, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "David Shapiro, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["women's employment", "salaried employment", "returns to education", "gender wage gap", "economic reform in Vietnam", "multilevel model"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "POLYOL SYNTHESIS OF PALLADIUM HYDRIDE: BULK POWDERS VS.

Case studies involve prediction of deletion strategies for different amino acids in Escherichia coli. Next, an integrated framework, OptStrain is presented to uncover and investigate different alternative pathways in conjunction with the examination of multiple organisms and substrates for selecting the best strategy for producing a target metabolite. These alternative pathways are identified from a database of reactions compiled from publicly available biopathway databases and stoichiometric models of metabolism. Results include manipulation strategies for overproducing hydrogen in networks of vastly different microbial organisms such as E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum and Methylobacterium extorquens, and for vanillin production in E. coli. The array of in silico genetic manipulations that can be predicted by using optimization frameworks is completed by the OptReg framework which can predict inhibition, up regulation and deletion of reactions for strain redesign.

The main goal of the Spectrally Agile Frequency-Incrementing REconfigurable (SAFIRE) system was to detect buried and concealed landmines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from safe stand-off distances. The radar aims to accomplish this goal in the presence of clutter and radio frequency interference (RFI).  This dissertation discusses basic stepped-frequency radar (SFR) principles, SAFIRE system specifications and measurements, theoretical performance of forward-looking GPRs for concealed target detection, experimental  SAFIRE radar imagery, radar image formation, and applicable signal processing techniques. \n\nTraditional stepped-frequency waveforms consist of multiple pulses of narrowband signals (sinusoids). Unlike impulse-based UWB radars, SFRs have the ability to excise specific frequencies within their operating band, thus reducing interference to nearby systems. Furthermore, through spectral sensing techniques, the frequency bands where RFI is present can easily be removed. \n\nA brief synopsis of current state-of-the-art forward-looking GPRs used for concealed target detection is given. The rationale for the principal system specifications and user-controllability is given. System architecture and mixing scheme are discussed with a justification for both. Verification of the system's operational specifications was completed via laboratory measurements and theoretical analysis; the laboratory measurements included transmitted power, spectral purity, receiver gain, receiver noise figure, receiver noise floor, dynamic range, antenna measurements, and overall susceptibility to RFI. Thinned spectrum algorithms are discussed, and their performance on measured experiment data are provided.

Nowhere is complexity and information management more critical than in the design and construction of healthcare facilities.  However, the construction management literature represents limited knowledge of information flow on projects. To address this deficiency, this research uses an ethnographic study of the design and construction of two complex healthcare facilities to address the two main research aims: 1) To understand the mechanisms and moderators that affect information flow, and 2) To develop a model that can be used to explain and evaluate processes for information flow management.  \nBecause of its long-term, in-depth nature, this study enables the industry to gain a better understand of both the social and technical factors that affect the management of information. Specifically, the analyses found four significant socio-technical factors (i.e. trust, commitment, learning, and common understanding) that have a profound effect on team interactions and the resulting effectiveness of information flow.  The key contribution of this research is the development of a conceptual model that illustrates how these four factors interact to affect information flow.  The interaction model that was developed links a trust/commitment cycle to a learning/understanding cycle.  These two cycles together influence information flow on projects and can be used to explain how characteristics of a project team interaction will affect information flow.  In addition, this model is used to analyze why certain mechanisms (e.g. behaviors, techniques, or processes) resulted in effective information flow while others did not.  \nThere are two important implication of these findings is addressed in this dissertation.  The first is related to what these findings mean in terms of the implementation of lean production management principles for information flow.  The second is related to the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the \u201ccoordinator\u201d or \u201cintegrator\u201d role (often called the \u201cproject manager\u201d).  While traditionally, project managers bring together technical information on the project, there is a significant aspect of social coordination that significantly affects information flow. To this issue, the following research also creates a definition of the integrator based upon both the social and technical aspects of information and information flow.  In this capacity, an integrator is responsible for understanding both the factors affecting information flow and how the use of certain tools or techniques can create an environment that fosters the development of trust and learning among the team.  The combination of developing descriptive conceptual models and providing more comprehensive definitions of the integrator role make this research critical to furthering our industry\u2019s understanding the mechanisms behind information flow and how project teams can make better use of information to improve project outcomes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [117], "author_name_tesi": "Phelps, Andreas Floros", "last_name_ssi": "Phelps", "middle_name_ssi": "Floros", "first_name_ssi": "Andreas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Horman", "Michael Horman", "David R Riley Ii", "John Messner", "Madhu Reddy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Horman, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Horman, Committee Chair", "David R Riley Ii, Committee Chair", "John Messner, Committee Member", "Madhu Reddy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["healthcare facilities", "Construction", "integration", "lean", "information flow", "social factors", "ethnography", "sustainability"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Does Sentence Context Constrain Cross-Language Lexical Access?\n\n", "id": "8412", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6166", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research on cross-language processing at the lexical level suggests that each of the bilingual\u2019s languages is active regardless of the requirement to use one language alone.

However, some reduction in the activation of the unintended language has been found when sentence context is highly constrained semantically. In the present study, we examined the effects of language-specific syntax on the nonselectivity of lexical access for Spanish-English and English-Spanish bilinguals. Specifically, participants named critical target words (cognates or controls) presented in the context of sentences with either language-specific or  language-non-specific syntax. We theorized that if the parallel activation of the bilingual\u2019s two languages can be eliminated in the presence of syntactically specific contextual information that corresponds to one language alone, then the cognate effect in word naming, found in previous studies in out-of-context naming, should also be eliminated in context.

Specifically, recent work with human infants suggests that infant cortisol patterning is sensitive to quality of caregiving (Grant et al., 2009; Albers et al., 2008; Blair et al., 2008; Kaplan et al., 2008), as well as to environmental contextual factors related to family adversity (Saridjan et al., 2010).  This study sought to examine diurnal cortisol in early infancy, as predicted by maternal emotional availability (EA) at bedtime and quality of co-parenting, a measure of the family environment.  Furthermore, because infant temperament has also been associated with infant diurnal cortisol and cortisol response to stress (Kartes et al., 2009; Talge, Donzella, & Gunnar, 2008; Schmidt et al. 1997), this study sought to examine how individual differences in temperament at 3 months of age influence the development of the diurnal rhythm, as well as how infant temperament interacts with quality of caregiving and the co-parenting environment to influence the development of the diurnal rhythm.  Lastly, this study sought to examine whether infant sleep quality mediates the associations of maternal EA, co-parenting quality, and infant temperament with infant diurnal cortisol.  The results indicated that maternal EA, co-parenting quality, and temperament are associated with diurnal cortisol in very young infants.  At 1 month, infant diurnal cortisol patterning was related to negative co-parenting in the family environment, and at 3 months it was linked to maternal EA and infant negative affectivity.  In addition, maternal EA at 1 month predicted infant diurnal cortisol at 3 months.  In multiple regression analyses examining the unique associations of maternal EA, co-parenting quality, and infant temperament with infant diurnal cortisol, maternal EA emerged as the most important factor influencing the development of infant diurnal cortisol patterning.  The interactions of infant temperament with maternal EA and co-parenting quality were not significant, and the relationships between co-parenting quality and infant cortisol, maternal EA and infant cortisol, and infant temperament and infant cortisol were not mediated by the quality of infant sleep.

These include sleep and neuroendocrine functioning, both of which are foundational for healthy social and emotional development.  These regulatory processes, however, are complexly determined.  They are rooted in biology but are also in continuous transaction with the environment, and there is evidence that children\u2019s physiological regulation both impacts and is impacted by quality of parenting.  To date, few studies have been sufficiently designed to enable an exploration of these bidirectional effects.  This dissertation aimed to elucidate how parenting and child regulation influence one another, looking specifically at child regulatory processes of sleep (Study I) and neuroendocrine functioning (Study II).  In doing so, particular attention was given to quality of parenting during children\u2019s bedtimes and during the night.  Parenting in child sleep contexts has rarely been studied observationally, and these contexts may pose regulatory challenges for infants and be stressful for parents as well.  \n\nData for both studies were drawn from a larger NIH-funded study of 167 families.  Study I used multilevel modeling to explore how maternal emotional availability (EA) at bedtime and time spent engaged in specific parenting practices were concurrently and longitudinally associated with infant nighttime distress and sleep across the first six months.  At time points when mothers were more emotionally available at bedtime, infants were less distressed and slept more of the night.  At time points when infants co-slept more with a parent they also tended to be less distressed, though on average more co-sleeping was linked to less infant sleep.  Higher EA in combination with less close contact at bedtime was associated with more infant sleep across the night on average.  Furthermore, less nursing at bedtime predicted a more rapid increase in infant sleep with age, as did the combination of higher maternal EA and fewer arousing activities at bedtime.  There was also evidence of infant-driven effects, as higher infant nighttime distress predicted lower EA at the following time point.  \n\nStudy II used multilevel modeling to examine how parenting at bedtime and nighttime was concurrently and longitudinally associated with infant nighttime cortisol levels and patterning across the first year.  Infants had higher cortisol levels at time points when they were more distressed and when their mothers were less emotionally available or awakened them more often during the night.  However, on average infants whose mothers responded more often to their nighttime distress had lower cortisol levels.  Higher maternal EA was also associated with change in infant cortisol across the night, whereas lower EA predicted a pattern of less overnight change, which was maintained across time.  Additionally, higher infant morning cortisol predicted lower maternal EA at the following time point above and beyond the effect of infant nighttime distress.  \n\nThis dissertation contributes to a larger body of literature addressing bidirectional relationships between parent and child.  The results support a bidirectional model of relations between parenting and infant regulation, in that parenting was predictive of developmental change in infant sleep patterning and neuroendocrine functioning, infants were sensitive to variation in maternal care, and mothers were sensitive to variation in their infant's regulation.  The findings also point to the utility of observing parent-child dynamics in child sleep contexts, which may be particularly helpful in elucidating the complex linkages between parenting and early childhood physiological regulation.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11244], "author_name_tesi": "Philbrook, Lauren Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Philbrook", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Michael Teti", "Kristin Buss", "Lisa Michelle Kopp", "Sy Miin Chow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Michael Teti, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Buss, Committee Chair", "Lisa Michelle Kopp, Committee Member", "Sy Miin Chow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["infants", "parenting", "sleep", "cortisol", "regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "DIRECTIONAL DECOUPLING OF PIEZOELECTRIC SHEET ACTUATORS FOR HIGH-PRECISION SHAPE AND VIBRATION CONTROL OF PLATE STRUCTURES", "id": "6920", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4222", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this thesis is to investigate directional decoupling of\npiezoceramic-based actuators for high precision shape and vibration control of twodimensional\nplate structures.\nSignificant research exists concerning shape control of two-dimensional adaptive\noptical structures with attached piezoelectric ceramic sheet actuators. Researchers have\ninvestigated the optimal placement, size, and electrode pattern of the piezoceramic\nactuators to maximize the system performance. In many situations, the performance\ncould be further improved with tailoring of the actuator configuration. For example, it\nwas found that to avoid creating short wavelength deformation (higher order deformation\nmodes) in two-dimensional structures, the ideal actuator would be one that is\ndirectionally decoupled, i.e., only actuates in one direction when controlling certain static\ndeformation modes of interests. In applications where high precision is a requirement, a\ndirectional decoupled actuator can improve the shape control performance by decreasing\nthe actuation authority to the higher order undesired deformations while maintaining\nsufficient authority for the controlled modes. In addition to shape control, vibration\ncontrol of large flexible space structures is continually challenging to engineers due to the\nlarge number of actuators and sensors, and the large number of vibration modes within\nthe operational bandwidth. For these structures, due to the small amount of damping\navailable, spillover effects need to be addressed when active controls are utilized.\nIn this thesis, two directional decoupling methods are proposed for high-precision\nshape and vibration control, namely the Active Stiffener (AS) and the MacroFiber\nComposite (MFC). The objectives of the investigation are to analyze the two\nconfigurations, understand their characteristics, provide insights for better design and\ncontrol, and experimentally validate the theoretical findings.\niv\nThe Active Stiffener is a new stiffener-piezoceramic actuator pair concept that\nconsists of a passive insert (stiffener) placed between the host structure and the active\npiezoelectric actuator. The basic premise is that the insert (stiffener) will reduce the\ntransmitted moment to the host structure in the direction desired for decoupling while\nallowing an adequate moment to transmit in the actuation direction. In this study, a\nlocal analysis of the AS actuator is first developed to gain a proficient understanding of\nthe actuator and determine parameters that can best achieve the decoupling actions.\nUsing finite element analysis techniques, investigations of a single AS attached to rigid\nand flexible host structures are presented. The effects of various material and system\nparameters on the applied bending moments (active authority in both directions) to the\nhost structure are illustrated. It is shown that, with proper design, the AS can\nsignificantly reduce the active authority in a selected direction while maintaining\nsufficient authority in the orthogonal direction.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of the new AS configuration for shape and\nvibration control, analytical and experimental efforts are carried out to examine the\nperformance of the AS actuators in controlling 2-dimensional plate structures. Analysis\nis performed on two large flexible circular plate structures, one having the Direct\nAttached (DA) actuators and the other utilizing the AS actuators. For shape control,\nmore reductions in surface error can be achieved with the AS compared to equivalent\nsystems having DA actuators. The DA actuators generate more localized deformation\nthan the AS in the structure due to the coupled planar actuation of the DA actuator. The\nanalysis results performed for each deformation shape demonstrate that a stiffener height\ngreater than zero maximizes the shape control performance, i.e. the DA actuator is never\nthe ideal actuator. The experimental results verify the analytical predictions and clearly\ndemonstrate the performance improvement of the AS concept over the DA actuator.\nFor vibration control, analytical and experimental efforts are carried out to\nexamine the ability of the Active Stiffener actuators for reducing controller spillover\nthrough the stiffeners\u2019 decoupling properties. It is shown that significant reductions in\nv\ncontroller spillover can be achieved in systems using the Active Stiffener actuators when\ncompared to systems having Direct Attached actuators, thus resulting in improved\nvibration control performance. Vibration analysis results confirm the shape control\nresults where a stiffener height greater than zero is always the ideal actuator. The\nexperimental results verify the analytical predictions where the AS has an increased\nstability margin due to the reduced controller spillover effect.\nSimilar to the Active Stiffener, the MacroFiber Composite (MFC) actuator\npossesses several advantages over the planar monolithic piezoceramic actuator, such as\nincreased toughness, flexibility, higher longitudinal strains, and higher specific work\noutput. Also, the anisotropy of the actuator can be modified or changed by the selection\nof the parameters at the material, lamina, and laminate levels of fabrication. Many\napplications have been explored using the composite actuators; however, they have not\nbeen specifically studied and utilized for their directional decoupling characteristics.\nAnalytical and experimental efforts are performed to examine the feasibility of using the\nMFC\u2019s for high precision shape and vibration control. The analytical and experimental\nresults demonstrate that the MFC\u2019s can dramatically reduce the surface error and\ncontroller spillover for shape and vibration control. When compared to equivalent\nsystems having DA and AS actuators, the MFC performs better than the DA for all\nmodes and is comparable in performance to the AS. While the MFC treatment requires\nmuch larger voltages than the AS treatment, it\u2019s power requirement is lower. Using a 3-\nD composites model of the actuator based upon the Uniform Fields Model, it is observed\nthat the system performance can be maximized or the voltage requirements can be\nreduced through tailoring the fiber volume fraction.\nThe research achievements of this thesis are summarized in the final chapter.\nRecommendations are made for improving upon the work presented here, and some\npossible future research directions on related topics are also presented.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4194], "author_name_tesi": "Philen, Michael Keith", "last_name_ssi": "Philen", "middle_name_ssi": "Keith", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adaptive mirror", "shape control", "vibration control", "smart materials", "directional decopuling", "piezoceramics", "plate"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Investigation On The Supply Chain Implications Of Modularized Designs Considering End-of-life And Life Expectancy", "id": "16400", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7854", "abstract_tesi": "Modularity aids in the development of new products quickly and easily. Companies nowadays are faced with the challenge of providing as much variety as possible; accordingly, mass customization is adopted. Mass customization frequently employs modularity. However, in order to mass customize effectively, supply chain factors also have to be taken into account. Along with supply chain and manufacturing considerations growing environmental concerns have forced companies to look at the end-of-life options for different components present in their products.\nThis study presents a framework to incorporate component end-of-life options (i.e., reuse, recycle and dispose) during early design stages in order to simultaneously account for supply chain factors, such as cost and carbon footprint. Manufacturers could benefit from a methodology that analyzes modular product architectures for overall life-cycle efficiency. In order to accomplish this, we extend a software framework originally developed by (Gupta and Okudan, 2008); this software aimed at creating a computational design tool that would aid designers in developing new modular products by taking into account design for assembly (DfA) and design for variety (DfV). This is an extension to that work where the user will have the ability to generate designs taking into account component end-of-life options, and to select suppliers for the components present in these modules.\nThree types of modularization methodologies are used and their results are analyzed. In the first methodology the decomposition approach (DA) is used where the main focus for modularization is component suitability in addition to their interactions. For the second modularization method a new methodology called green decomposition approach (Green DA) is presented in which the end-of-life options are used to determine the component suitability; however, the decomposition algorithm is still employed. In the third approach, a simulated annealing (SA) inspired hierarchical search algorithm is used. In all three methodologies component suitability, life expectancy and end-of-life are used as criteria for module selection, this enables us to compare the three which methodologies. Suppliers are then\niv\nselected for these components based on their cost, lead time and overall carbon footprint. This enables the designer to understand the trade-offs between the designs generated by each of these modularization methodologies and their associated costs, lead times and carbon footprints.\nWe compare two designs which are selected based on their DFA index and the three main modularization methodologies.

These compartments are required for various tissue functions such as nutrient absorption in the intestine, waste removal in the kidney, and neural function of the brain and retina. Barriers are established by the adherens and tight junction protein complexes that form junctional protein strands that link adjacent cells. The adherens junction establishes cell adherence and polarization forming uniform cell layers, while the apical tight junction regulates the movement of ions, solutes, and water between cell layers establishing physiologic gradients. The abundance of the tight junction protein occludin inversely correlates with paracellular permeability characteristics but its function remains unclear in physiological settings. Our hypothesis is that a reduction in occludin protein content will result in increased paracellular permeability, specifically with the addition of a physiologic transmural pressure gradient. To explore occludin\u2019s role in the tight junction, occludin content was reduced 60% with transient introduction of short inhibitory RNA in ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelium cells. Reduction in occludin content did not alter mRNA or protein abundance of the junctional components zonula occludens-1, claudin-1, claudin-2, or epithelial cadherin, nor inhibit intracellular junction formation. Occludin protein reduction did not affect diffusive permeability to 70 kDa and 10 kDa dextran, but increased permeability to 467 Da tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) by 14% compared to control cells. Application of a 10 cmH2O transmural pressure gradient resulted in an initial increase in permeability, followed by an adaptive reduction in permeability over time. This phenomenon has been termed the \u201csealing effect\u201d and has been previously observed in endothelial cells. Under a 10 cmH2O hydrostatic pressure, permeability to TAMRA increased 50% in occludin depleted cells compared to control. Conversely, permeability to 70 kDa dextran was decreased 50% in occludin-depleted cells compared to control cells. The data suggest that occludin is necessary for the cell\u2019s adaptive response to pressure changes under physiologic conditions and occludin regulates small molecule (467 Da) permeability. Occludin content reduction also caused a 90% increase in DNA synthesis as determined by tritiated thymidine incorporation and a similar increase in cell division was confirmed by Ki67 immuno-staining. The use of cell cycle inhibitors revealed that increased cell division was not responsible for alterations in permeability. These data\ndemonstrate for the first time that reduction of occludin increases cell division rates and reveals occludin\u2019s contribution to small molecule permeability is independent of cell cycle control.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [671], "author_name_tesi": "Phillips, Brett E", "last_name_ssi": "Phillips", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Antonetti", "Anthony Edward Pegg", "Charles H Lang", "Jiyue Zhu", "Steven F Abcouwer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Antonetti, Committee Chair", "Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member", "Steven F Abcouwer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cell Division", "ARPE-19", "Tight Junctions", "Paracellular Permeability"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Deformation Studies on Directionally Solidified Eutectic LaB6-ZrB2\n", "id": "9146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "996", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Directionally solidified eutectic LaB6-ZrB2 samples were studied for potential use as\nultra-high-temperature materials.

Auxin has been found to play a crucial role in many aspects of growth, including cell division and expansion, flower development, adventitious root growth, tropisms, vascular development, and leaf phyllotaxy.  Many genes that play a role in auxin-mediated growth and development have been identified in maize.  In this thesis, the genetic regulation of maize vegetative and reproductive development will be examined, with a particular focus on the roles of auxin in these processes.\n\nThe importance of polar auxin transport has previously been demonstrated in maize through the barren inflorescence2 (bif2) mutant.  bif2 is co-orthologous to PINOID (PID) of Arabidopsis, which functions in the subcellular localization of the auxin efflux carrier PINFORMED1 (PIN1).  pin, pid, and bif2 mutants all exhibit severe defects in reproductive development, including lack of flowers in pin and pid in Arabidopsis, and lack of branches and production of few or no spikelets in bif2 in maize.  Another maize mutant, barren stalk1 (ba1), shows a reproductive phenotype similar to bif2, however ba1 mutants have been shown to transport auxin normally.  ba1 was instead found to play a role in initiating an appropriate response to auxin, as mutants fail to initiate axillary meristems despite having the required levels of auxin at sites of meristem initiation.  Finally, the maize mutant spi1 has recently been shown to function in auxin biosynthesis.  spi1 mutants exhibit dramatic defects in both vegetative and reproductive development, including reduced height, leaf number, branch number, spikelet number, and kernel number.\n\nIn Chapter 2, the characterization and cloning of vanishing tassel2 is presented.  vt2 mutants resemble spi1 mutants, with defects in both vegetative and reproductive development.  vt2;spi1 double mutants exhibit an additive genetic interaction, suggesting they function independently in maize development.  Conversely, vt2;bif2 double mutants show a severely synergistic interaction in both vegetative and reproductive growth, indicating the crucial role of both auxin biosynthesis and auxin transport in maize development.  Cloning of the vt2 locus has revealed that it encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase required for auxin biosynthesis.\n\nIn Chapter 3, the characterization of the novel maize mutant Developmental disaster1 is presented.  Unlike the other mutants described which are recessive, Dvd1 mutants are semidominant. Similar to vt2, Dvd1 mutants also show severe defects in vegetative and reproductive development.  However, scanning electron microscopy reveals that Dvd1 inflorescence phenotypes share more similarity with ba1 mutants than with vt2.  In addition, the genetic interaction of Dvd1 with bif2 has revealed that the two genes function independently in maize development, unlike the interaction of vt2 with bif2.  Additional results, including current Dvd1 mapping data and genetic interactions with other maize mutants, are presented in Appendix A.  Future positional cloning of the locus will reveal the nature of this mutation and further elucidate the critical role that Dvd1 plays in maize development.\n\nCharacterization of the vt2 and Dvd1 phenotypes illustrates that mutants with similar severe defects in vegetative and reproductive development can have different underlying mechanisms. The cloning of vt2 is a significant contribution to the field since it reveals the importance of one of the Tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis pathways for the first time in monocots.  The mapping of Dvd1 provides the groundwork for its cloning in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3321], "author_name_tesi": "Phillips, Kimberly Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Phillips", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paula Mc Steen", "Paula Mc Steen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paula Mc Steen, Thesis Advisor", "Paula Mc Steen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["vanishing tassel2", "tryptophan aminotransferase", "Poaceae", "plant hormone", "mutation", "meristem", "maize", "internode", "inflorescence", "indole-3-acetic acid", "IAA", "Developmental disaster1", "development", "bract", "barren", "auxin biosynthesis", "auxin", "vegetative", "Zea mays"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A Novel Role for beta(Heavy)-Spectrin in Early Endosome Recycling in the Drosophila melanogaster Larval Midgut", "id": "6637", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4057", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tPolarity is essential for the function of epithelial tissues.  Epithelial polarity is marked by the division of the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral membrane domains, a division actively maintained by the delivery and retention of proteins in each domain.  In parallel, an apicolateral junctional complex passively maintains the distinct biochemical composition of each domain by acting as a molecular fence.  Both of these mechanisms for maintaining epithelial polarity depend to some degree on the cytoskeleton, a complex network of microtubules and F-Actin that is essential for polarized protein delivery, and interacts with integral membrane proteins and components of the junctional complex.  The Spectrin-based membrane skeleton (SBMS) is a specialization of the actin cytoskeleton that forms a lattice on flat membranes.  There it both regulates the transport of vesicles and provides a stable platform for the binding of adaptor proteins such as Ankyrin.  The discovery that the Spectrin skeleton is polarized in epithelia, with different isoforms isolated to different domains, provides a mechanism to explain how differences in apical and basolateral domains are maintained.  \n\tSpectrin tetramers are composed of two alpha and two beta subunits.  beta-Spectrin isoforms are thought to be central for activities that contribute to the polarization of Spectrin tetramers, as well as their distinct functions.  Drosophila melanogaster is ideal for studying the role of beta subunits in the function of the SBMS, since it only encodes two isoforms: a conventional beta and a beta heavy (betaH).  The Drosophila Spectrin skeleton is polarized in epithelia, with basolateral (alpha/beta)2 and apical (alpha/betaH)2 tetramers.  \n\tPrevious results have shown that the Spectrin skeleton acts as a molecular scaffold, stabilizing a subset of membrane proteins at a particular membrane domain.  However, my results point to a different effect on polarity.  In betaH mutants, the apical Spectrin skeleton is lost, and defects in midgut acidification point to a loss of the apical proton-pumping V-type ATPase.  Immunohistochemical work presented herein shows that the lack of midgut acidification is correlated with the loss of this V-ATPase not only from the apical membrane, but from a system of early endosomes involved in protein recycling.  The early endosome pathway itself is compromised in these mutants, yet my work also shows that the delivery of apical proteins does not apparently require the SBMS.  These results suggest that in betaH mutants an entire class of proteins normally recycled to and from the membrane may be prematurely degraded in the lysosome.  For example, the trace mineral copper demonstrates a defective and lesser accumulation in betaH mutant midgut cells, suggesting the apically localized copper transporter Ctr-1 may also be affected.   \n\tIn addition, this work demonstrates functional differences in the polarizing activities of the epithelia derived from the surface ectoderm vs. the midgut.  The C-terminal domain of betaH possesses a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain that interacts with membrane lipids and may be responsible for the delivery of the protein to the apical membrane.  In the salivary gland, protein constructs made from the C-terminus of betaH do not show specific membrane localization, but instead cause the accumulation of membrane in large multifolded structures.  My results in midgut, however, indicate that membrane delivery and retention at specific domains is contained in sequences C-terminal to the PH domain.  Also, while I observe in the midgut a phenotype superficially similar to the membrane accumulations in salivary gland, the structures in midgut exhibit different positioning in the cell as well as a distinct protein composition.  \n\tFinally, it is essential to study Spectrin function in clinically relevant systems.  Spectrin mutations are associated with hemolytic anemias in humans, and neuronal pathologies in mice.  A betaH isoform (beta5) has been reported in humans, where it preserves many features found in the fly and nematode proteins.  Here I report and analyze the sequence of beta5 isoforms in mouse and chicken, which also contain many similarities to known b heavy isoforms.  I also performed in situ hybridizations to determine the developmental expression profile of beta5 in mice, which show that it is either expressed at low levels or not at all through 10 days post conception.  However, an anti-human beta5 antibody detects strong signal in adult mouse cardiac muscle and cerebellar axons of the white matter, suggesting that beta5 is essential for the function of these organs.  \n\tThe roles of unconventional beta-Spectrin subunits in cell polarity and animal development are just now being discovered.  Therefore, the work presented in this thesis addresses both their structures and functions in both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4032], "author_name_tesi": "Phillips, Matthew D.", "last_name_ssi": "Phillips", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas", "Carol V Gay", "Simon Gilroy", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Chair", "Carol V Gay, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosophila", "midgut", "cuprophilic", "cell polarity", "endocytosis", "spectrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Cavitation Assessment and Hydrodynamic Performance Characteristics of a Marine Hydrokinetic Turbine Foil Design", "id": "15590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A uniquely designed hydrofoil for use on MHK turbines was tested in a water tunnel at The Pennsylvania State University's Applied Research Lab Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel.  Baseline tests were conducted with a NACA 4412 foil and compared with historical data to validate the facility and test procedures.  Lift and drag data were acquired using a six degree of freedom load cell.  Drag data calculated from LDV wake profiles showed good agreement with the load cell data.  The new hydrofoil, MHKF1-180s, was designed for improved cavitation performance with lower sensitivity to roughness and reduced probability to trailing edge singing.  The MHKF1-180s exhibited improved cavitation performance when compared to the NACA 4412.  The sensitivity to both distributed and isolated roughness was studied on the MHKF1-180s hydrofoil with the overall conclusion that isolated roughness affected the cavitation performance more dramatically than distributed roughness and the effect was greater with larger particle size.  The NACA 4412 also had a lower sensitivity to roughness than the MHKF1-180s but this is likely due to a thickness effect.  This result proved that foiling or damage sensitivity is an important design consideration.  The experimental water tunnel data was also compared to Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes CFD simulations and there was variation in the results likely due to a transitional effect.  An LDV spectral analysis was performed on the trailing edge to capture vortex shedding and the conclusion was that the frequency spikes in the spectra data were related to the reference height of the trailing edge singing geometry.

This concept has now been extended to electrical network systems, some liquid pipeline networks, computer networks and general mathematical research. Researchers have been able to show that under certain conditions, the Braess Paradox occurs in all of these systems. The primary objective of this research is to observe the effects of Braess\u2019 Paradox in natural gas pipeline networks, and possible methods of optimizing natural gas flow with this knowledge.\nCurrently, no research has been carried out concerning the effects of the Braess Paradox in natural gas pipeline networks. Upon reviewing some of the research that has already been carried out in electrical network systems and some pipe network systems, we have now demonstrated that there are conditions under which the Braess Paradox occurs in natural gas systems. Being able to determine the conditions under which this might occur would definitely aid optimization of natural gas pipeline network systems in designing the structures and in selecting the pipe routes.\nWe ran several simulations using small gas networks, ranging from single-pipe cases to Wheatstone structures and five-pipe structures, to much larger networks with as many as 100 pipes. Based on our research, we have concluded that there are conditions where we will observe the paradox in networks with four or more pipes, depending on the topology of the network, the conductivity of the pipes, and the ratio of flow in the inlet (supply) and outlet (demand) nodes. For the much larger network with 100 pipes or more, we also observe the occurrence of the\niv\nparadox by reducing the networks to Ward equivalents of the smaller network structures, and observing the sensitivity of flow parts of the large network to slight changes in gas demand. Performing these tests has enabled us observe that indeed, our hypothesis about the occurrence of the paradox in Natural Gas networks, was true.\nThe work also proposes an economic model that studies the costs involved with observing the paradox within an already-existing network, and how this affects the decision-maker\u2019s net present value (NPV) for that particular network. Based on the NPV, the decision-maker can decide whether to shut down the pipeline causing the paradox, or to completely remove the pipeline from the network.

With the proliferation of high-throughput data generation and very large-scale simultaneous testing problems in the arena of genetic analysis, the development of procedures to control the false discovery rate has taken on increased importance.  In this dissertation we introduce three novel procedures with this specific goal.  Each procedure is specifically tailored for a different situation in multiple testing.  \n\nThe first procedure controls the false discovery rate when hypotheses are tested using next-generation sequencing data without experimental replication.  In this situation the p-values used are discrete and as a result classical error control procedures are conservative.  Existing approaches that are specifically for use with discrete p-values require the complete specification of each p-value's distribution function.  When a small number of p-values have complicated distribution functions these approaches can be very slow.  Our proposed procedure offers good error control properties, comparable power properties, and a computational advantage over existing procedures.\n\nWe further propose a procedure developed specifically to test the disjunction hypothesis, wich is appropriate when each gene or location studied is associated with multiple p-values of individual interest. This can occur when more than one aspect of an underlying process is measured. For example, cancer researchers may hope to detect genes that are both differentially expressed on a transcriptomic level and show evidence of copy number aberration. Currently used methods of p-value combination for this setting are overly conservative, resulting in very low power for detection. We introduce a method to test the disjunction hypothesis by using cumulative areas from the Voronoi diagram of two-dimensional vectors of p-values. Our method offers much improved power over existing methods, even in challenging situations, while maintaining appropriate error control.\n\nFinally we introduce a non-parametric procedure to control the false discovery rate while identifying reproducibility from the results of replicated high-throughput experiments.  Experiments of this type are important because their results can identify sets of genes or binding sites for focused follow-up studies, however the variability from one experiment to another presents a well-known difficulty to researchers.  We present a novel procedure to identify genes with consistent signals across replicated experiments.  This procedure makes no model assumptions about reproducible genes and is free of tuning parameters.  We show that it has good error control and power properties in a variety of different settings, as well as show some theoretical results.

The control plane functionality is provided by a centralized network operating system. By moving this functionality to software, a range of new capabilities are possible in networks. This thesis describes and evaluates a new algorithm, called Congestion Avoidance For Fairness & Efficiency In Network Entities (CAFFEINE) that uses SDN provided capabilities.\n\n CAFFEINE provides dynamic routing in network topology for long-lived network traffic with goals of fully utilizing network capacity and maintaining fairness among traffic classes through Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. CAFFEINE is designed to spread these long-lived traffic flows throughout an organization\u2019s network. To achieve the goals, CAFFEINE periodically polls network devices in order to monitor the current network state. CAFFEINE routes traffic using a modified widest path algorithm, with path length constraints, to find a path in the network with maximum available bandwidth, and then it sets QoS guarantees on that path.\n\nFrom a service view, CAFFEINE consists of a network monitoring service, a rate limiting service, a queue management service, and a flexible routing service. The network monitoring service is responsible for polling the state of the network from the controller in SDN and calculating aggregate information. The flexible routing service periodically receives the aggregated network state information and re-calculates the new routes. The rate limiting service also receives that network state information and uses this state to set a minimum guaranteed bandwidth and a maximum allowed bandwidth for every class of traffic on each output port of every router in the topology. The queue management service then sets rules in the network switches to assign the new flow to a particular path in the network.\n\nThe evaluation of CAFFEINE is simulated on virtual networks using Mininet, virtualization software that can simulate hosts and switches. The testing compares CAFFEINE against a conventional routing scheme that uses shortest path routing. Multiple tests, which represent variety of networks, show that CAFFEINE is able to utilize network spare capacity and can prioritize network flows from preconfigured rules. CAFFINE allows network administrators to categorize different flows to different priorities for weighted fairness and gain better throughput.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11208], "author_name_tesi": "Phinjirapong, Pattanapoom ", "last_name_ssi": "Phinjirapong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pattanapoom", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Joseph Blum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Joseph Blum, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Networking", "Software Defined Networking", "SDN", "OpenFlow"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Review of the genus Diplotaxodon with a description of two new species", "id": "19629", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9559", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A review of the described species of the genus Diplotaxodon Trewavas 1935, deep water (offshore) fishes endemic to Lake Mala\u0175i, was conducted and included the description of two new species.

As a result, an individuals\u2019 perceptual system becomes tuned over the course of their lifetime to recognize particular faces.  For example, adults exhibit biases such that they show superior recognition abilities for faces belonging to particular categories (e.g. race, species, age, gender) of faces. The own-age bias (OAB) is one such bias and is reflected in better recognition of similar aged faces. The literature investigating this phenomenon in children and adolescents is sparse and inconclusive at best. The present study examined the independent contributions of age and puberty to the formation of the OAB as children, adolescents, and adults recognize male and female faces. In so doing, this study specifically tested predictions from a novel theory that emphasizes the role of age-appropriate social developmental tasks in shaping face processing behavior, including the OAB, particularly during adolescence and pubertal development (Scherf, Behrmann, & Dahl, 2012; Scherf & Scott, 2012). Consistent with the theory, prepubescent children (ages 6-8 yrs) did not exhibit an OAB, but instead showed a recognition bias in favor of adult female faces. Adolescents in the early stages of pubertal development did not exhibit any consistent biases in recognition behavior, indicating a potential disruption in the pattern of biases with the onset of gonadarche.

I combine incompatible and fluid-mobile trace elements and radiogenic lithophile isotope compositions to interpret the genesis of Sivas, Central Anatolia mafic lavas and the source components for mafic lavas throughout the Anatolian-circum-Mediterranean region. The data provide insight into the long-term (~1.8 Ga) geologic and tectonic history of the area. I use major and trace element compositions of Sivas mafic lavas to define two groups with contrasting petrogenetic histories. The first group is comprised of basalts and basaltic trachyandesites. Their low Ba/Nb, La/Nb, and Th/Nb values are similar to those observed in mantle-derived basalts and suggest they are derived from an asthenospheric mantle-dominated source. The second group are basanites that are enriched in incompatible trace elements relative to mid-ocean ridge basalts and have high Ba/Nb, La/Nb, and Th/Nb values indicative of a source in metasomatized sub-continental lithosphere containing hydrous phases such as amphibole.  I also use the major element compositions of clinopyroxene phenecrysts in the mafic lavas to constrain the pressures of melting and differentiation for Sivas mafic lavas. Specifically clinopyroxene Al contents of the basaltic group suggest crystallization both at lower crustal depths (~10 kb) and at near-surface pressures. In contrast, basanite clinopyroxene indicate only one stage of crystal growth at around 5-8 kb prior to eruption. Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotope compositions of Sivas mafic lavas support and expand on the trace element findings. As seen in trace element compositions, the basaltic group consistently records higher asthenospheric contributions while the basanites with more radiogenic Sr and Pb low Nd isotope values originate from magmas with higher contributions from metasomatized sub-continental lithosphere. The Pb isotope signatures also record pseudo-binary mixing between shallow depleted asthenosphere, a regionally heterogeneous lithosphere, and a common mantle source with the isotopic characteristics of the C component or the circum-Mediterranean asthenosphere to form Sivas magmas. Calculated Nd model ages relative to depleted mantle indicate the incorporated lithosphere stabilized from the mantle between 1.8 and 1.2 Ga corresponding to assembly of Rodinia and Columbia supercontinents. Variations in source contributions and lithosphere stabilization ages appear to correlate with the geographic location of a modern strike-slip fault along the K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River in the Sivas Basin, suggesting that Sivas mafic lavas record contributions from distinct lithospheric packages that are juxtaposed across a major crustal suture. One important implication of this result is that the oft-invoked subduction modification of mantle source regions contributing to Anatolian volcanism is not related to the more recent Miocene closure of Africa and Eurasia, but rather is an ancient inherited feature that has been present for an extended period of time.\nThis dissertation also gives insight on science education and focuses on evidence for progression of knowledge with age and importance of targeted teaching.

These historic data can then be compared to current data to see how macroinvertebrate communities have changed over time.\n\nIn this study, the fishes whose gut content most accurately reflected the benthic macroinvertebrate community of a freshwater stream, specifically Marshalls Creek, were identified. Both fish species and benthic macroinvertebrates were collected at various sites of Marshalls Creek in East Stroudsburg, PA, in March, August, and December 2010. Collections were taken at different times of year to reflect seasonal variation both in species sampled and quantity collected. 231 fish were dissected and their gut contents identified.

Losing body weight (BW) is a proven method to reduce excess fat mass (FM) and ameliorate risk factors for chronic disease.  Lack of long-term dietary adherence to a weight loss plan can lead to unsuccessful maintenance of BW loss, weight regain and the persistence of health concerns.  Complicated dietary patterns that restrict certain macronutrients or food groups may be difficult to follow and can contribute to the lack of long-term dietary adherence.  However, a diet composed of whole grains, fruits, vegetables and lean proteins can provide adequate nutrients and has additional energy remaining for the accommodation of an individual\u2019s favorite snack food.  Certain snack foods may also provide additional health benefits. Cocoa and chocolate products contain potent antioxidants called flavanols.  Cocoa\u2019s high antioxidant content and potential to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation have been credited with the improvement of blood pressure (BP), lipid concentrations and insulin sensitivity.  Because several of the health effects observed with cocoa intake are similar to those benefits observed after BW loss, there may be an additive effect of consuming cocoa while reducing BW.  Therefore, this research project was conducted to evaluate the effects of incorporating two daily dark chocolate (DC) snacks and high-flavanol (HF) cocoa beverage into an energy-restricted diet (ERD) on BW, body composition, BP, metabolic parameters, oxidative stress and inflammatory proteins, markers of bone and mineral metabolism and bone mineral density (BMD).  \nSixty overweight and obese (body mass index &#8805;25<43 kg/m2) premenopausal women between the ages of 25 and 45 years were recruited in two waves for this 18-week randomized dietary intervention.  All women followed an ERD while being further randomized to consume either a twice daily snack of DC and a HF cocoa beverage (DC; n=30) or a twice daily snack of flavanol-free (FF) licorice and a FF, cocoa-free vanilla beverage (NC; n=30).  At baseline, and at weeks 6, 12 and 18 of the intervention, women underwent anthropometric measurements, a fasting blood draw and provided a 24-hour urine sample.    At baseline and week 18, participants completed 4-day food and 7-day physical activity records and underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure body composition and BMD.  Intention-to-treat analysis using data from all women who completed baseline measurements (n=60) and an efficacy analysis using only data from the women that completed the intervention (n=51) were conducted.  Differences in characteristics at baseline between groups and between study-completers and those who withdrew were also analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).  A 2 x 2 x 4 ANOVA with repeated measures on the time factor was performed to assess the main effects of cohort (cohort 1 and 2) and group (DC and NC) on all variables over the four intervals.  Interactions of cohort and group (Treatment) by interval (Time) were also assessed using 2 x 4 ANOVA.  \nAccording to the intention-to-treat analysis, the DC and NC groups significantly reduced energy intake by 379 and 437 kcals (both p<0.001), respectively.  Weight loss was 4.4 \u00b1 3.3 kg (mean \u00b1 SD) (p<0.001) and 5.0 \u00b1 4.9 kg (p<0.001) for the DC and NC groups, respectively.  Both groups similarly and significantly reduced waist and hip circumferences (both groups p<0.001), fat mass (FM) (both groups p<0.001) and abdominal FM (DC: p<0.001, NC: p<0.01).  Women in the NC group also experienced a decrease in fat-free mass (FFM) (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in anthropometrics or body composition measurements between groups at any interval throughout the study or in the change over time.\nThe DC group reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 2.7 mmHg (p<0.05) and 2.7 mmHg \n (p<0.01), respectively, and the NC group reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 3.4 and 4.2 mmHg (both p<0.01), respectively. The DC and NC groups, respectively, reduced glucose and insulin concentrations, respectively, by 13.0 mg/dL (p<0.001) and 1.9 &#61549;U/mL (p<0.01) and 14.9 mg/dL (p <0.001) and 1.9 &#61549;U/mL (p< 0.01).  The NC group demonstrated an increase in total cholesterol concentration (p<0.05) while the DC group experienced no changes in lipid parameters.  There were no differences in metabolic parameters between groups at any interval throughout the study or in the change over time.\nThe combined effect of the BW loss and additional flavanol consumption on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, markers of bone formation and resorption and mineral metabolism and BMD was assessed using data from women who completed the intervention and provided blood and urine samples at all four testing intervals.  At baseline, there were significant differences in physical activity (p<0.05) and N-telopeptide of bone type I collagen (NTx) concentration (p<0.05) between cohort 1 and 2; however, there were no differences between flavanol groups.  \nThere was a significant main effect of cohort on tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) and interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;) concentrations.  TNF-&#945; concentration was significantly greater in cohort 1 at weeks 6 and 12 (both p<0.001) and IL-1&#946; was significantly greater in cohort 2 at week 6 (p<0.05).  The decrease in TNF-&#945; from baseline to week 18 was only significant in cohort 1 (p<0.01) while the decrease in IL-1&#946; concentration was significant for both cohorts (p<0.001).  However, the overall change from baseline to week 18 in these biomarkers was not significantly different between cohorts.  \nThe effect of time was significant within groups in markers of inflammation.  The DC and NC groups had significant decreases in IL-6 (both groups p<0.001) and IL-1&#946; (both groups p<0.001) from baseline to week 18.  The DC group also had significant decreases in TNF-&#945; (p<0.01).  Neither group had significant changes in C-reactive protein or urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin F2&#61537; concentrations from baseline to week 18.  There were no significant differences between groups in markers of oxidative stress or inflammation at any interval throughout the intervention or in the change over time.\n\tThe effect of cohort was also significant for serum osteoprotegerin (OPG), NTx and receptor activator for nuclear factor &#1050;B ligand (RANKL) concentrations.  OPG concentration was significantly greater in cohort 2 at weeks 6 (p<0.001) and 12 (p<0.01).  The change in OPG from baseline was significantly different between cohorts (p<0.001) and the increase in OPG concentration from baseline to week 18 was significant for cohort 2 (p<0.001) but not for cohort 1.  NTx concentration was significantly higher in cohort 1 at baseline (p<0.001) and at weeks 6 (p<0.01) and 12 (p<0.05).  Cohort 1 experienced a decrease while cohort 2 experienced an increase in NTx concentration from baseline to week 18.  The change in NTX from baseline was significantly different between cohorts (p<0.01) and the decrease in NTx concentration from baseline to week 18 was significant for cohort 1 (p<0.05) but not for cohort 2.  Cohort 2 had a significantly higher RANKL concentration at week 6 (p<0.001) while cohort 1 had significantly higher RANKL concentration at week 12 (p<0.01). The change in RANKL from baseline to week 18 was not significantly different between cohorts and the change from baseline to week 18 was not significant for either cohort.  \n\tThe effect of time was significant within groups in markers of bone turnover.  Serum OPG significantly increased in the DC (p<0.01) and NC (p<0.001) groups with no significant overall change from baseline to week 18 in osteocalcin, NTx, or RANKL concentrations.  By week 18, serum phosphorus concentration (p<0.001) had significantly increased in the NC group while the DC group had no significant changes in mineral metabolism.  There were no significant differences between groups in markers of bone turnover or mineral metabolism at any interval throughout the intervention or in the change over time.\nFinally, there was a significant effect of cohort on forearm (FA) and hip BMD.  FA BMD was significantly greater in cohort 1 at week 18 (p<0.01).  The changes from baseline for hip (p<0.01) and FA BMD (p<0.001) were significantly different between cohorts and the increases from baseline to week 18 for hip (p<0.01) and FA BMD (p<0.001) were significant only in cohort 1.  The effect of time was significant within groups for BMD. The DC group had significant increases in hip (p<0.01) and FA BMD (p<0.01) and the NC group had a significant increase in FA BMD (p<0.001) from baseline to week 18.  There were no significant differences between groups in BMD at baseline or week 18 or in the change over time.\nResults of this investigation demonstrate that a short-term ERD which incorporates either two daily snacks of DC or FF licorice can achieve BW loss and improve body composition, BP, metabolic parameters and inflammatory status without adversely affecting lipid concentrations, markers of bone turnover or BMD.  Further, incorporating additional flavanols into an ERD in the form of two DC snacks and a HF cocoa beverage provided no greater benefit on metabolic parameters, markers of oxidative stress or inflammation or bone health following BW loss.\nBased on these results, daily calorie-controlled sweet snacks can be included within the context of an ERD without exceeding the energy reduction necessary for the induction of BW loss.  The act of reducing energy and losing BW provided multiple health improvements including a reduction in FM, BP, glucose and insulin concentrations and inflammatory status in healthy women independent of the type of snacks consumed.  Further, BW and FM loss may reduce obesity-induced inflammation thereby attenuating excess stimulation of bone resorption and leading to a maintenance of BMD in otherwise healthy, premenopausal women.  Therefore, overweight or obese yet otherwise healthy women should be encouraged to lose BW to improve current health status and reduce risk factors for future conditions without substantial concern for harming short-term bone health.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3391], "author_name_tesi": "Piehowski, Kathryn Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Piehowski", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelly Nickols Richardson", "Sharon M Nickols Richardsom", "Gordon Lee Jensen", "Neil Sharkey", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Roger John Mccarter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelly Nickols Richardson, Dissertation Advisor", "Sharon M Nickols Richardsom, Committee Chair", "Gordon Lee Jensen, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Roger John Mccarter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["weight loss", "Bone mineral density", "Fat mass"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Investigating Lipid Heterogeneity in Single Cells Using Secondary Ion Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry\n\n", "id": "10180", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4874", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Imaging time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) can be utilized to map the spatial distribution of small molecules on a surface with potentially submicron resolution.  Due to the inherent characteristics of this technique and its potential to provide higher spatial resolution than light microscopy based techniques without the use of chemical labels, it has been utilized to study the distribution of phospholipid species in the cell membrane.  It is now known that many cell membranes contain transient compositional heterogeneities, colloquially referred to as domains, which participate in vital physiological processes such as exocytosis and signal transduction.  Because of their size and lifetime, much remains unknown about the nature of these heterogeneities.  ToF-SIMS imaging combined with cryogenic sample preparation techniques is a promising analytical platform poised to contribute greatly to this growing field of study.\nSample preparation is crucial to obtaining quality lipid distribution maps, especially when dealing with single biological cells.  To achieve this end the Winograd and Ewing groups have developed a freeze-fracture methodology adapted from cryo-SEM studies. Freeze-etching, the practice of removing excess surface water from a sample through sublimation into the vacuum of the analysis environment, has also been extensively used in conjunction with electron microscopy.  This technique has been applied to ToF-SIMS imaging of cryogenically preserved single cells.  By removing the excess water which condenses onto the sample in vacuo, a uniform surface is produced that is ideal for imaging by static SIMS.  I demonstrate that the conditions employed to remove deposited water do not adversely affect cell morphology and do not redistribute molecules in the topmost surface layers.  In addition, I found that water can be controllably re-deposited onto the sample at temperatures below -100 oC in vacuum.  The re-deposited water increases the ionization of characteristic fragments of biologically interesting molecules 2-fold without loss of spatial resolution.  The utilization of freeze-etch methodology will increase the reliability of cryogenic sample preparations for SIMS analysis by providing greater control of the surface environment. Using these procedures, high quality spectra with both atomic bombardment as well as C60+ cluster ion bombardment, have been obtained.\nTo date, many cell imaging studies have concentrated on phosphatidylcholine distributions, owing to its abundance and high ionization efficiency.  However, cholesterol is a particularly interesting molecule due to its involvement in numerous biological processes.  For many studies, the effectiveness of chemical mapping is limited by low signal intensity from various bio-molecules.  Due to the high energy nature of the SIMS ionization process, many molecules are identified by detection of characteristic fragments.  Commonly, fragments of a molecule are identified using standard samples, and those fragments are used to map the location of the molecule.  MS/MS data obtained from a prototype C60+/ quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer was used in conjunction with indium LMIG imaging to map previously unrecognized cholesterol fragments in single cells.  A model system of J774 macrophages doped with cholesterol was used to show that these fragments are derived from cholesterol in cell imaging experiments.  Examination of relative quantification experiments reveals that m/z 147 is the most specific diagnostic fragment and offers a 3-fold signal enhancement.  These findings greatly increase the prospects for cholesterol mapping experiments in biological samples, particularly with single cell experiments.  In addition, these findings demonstrate the wealth of information that is hidden in the traditional ToF-SIMS spectrum.  \nIn order for this technique to provide insight into biological processes, it is critical to characterize the figures of merit.  Because a SIMS instrument counts individual events, the precision of the measurement is controlled by counting statistics.  As the analysis area decreases, the number of molecules available for analysis diminishes.  This becomes critical when imaging sub-cellular features; it limits the information obtainable, resulting in images with only a few counts of interest per pixel.  Many features observed in low intensity images are artifacts of counting statistics, making validation of these features crucial to arriving at accurate conclusions.  With ToF-SIMS imaging, the experimentally attainable spatial resolution is a function of the molecule of interest, sample matrix, concentration, primary ion, instrument transmission, and spot size of the primary ion beam.  A model, based on Poisson statistics, has been developed to validate SIMS imaging data when signal is limited.  This model can be used to estimate the effective spatial resolution and limits of detection prior to analysis, making it a powerful tool for tailoring future investigations.  In addition, the model allows for pixel-to-pixel intensity comparisons and can be used to validate the significance of observed image features.  The implications and capabilities of the model are demonstrated here by imaging the cell membrane of resting RBL-2H3 mast cells.\nMass spectrometry imaging has been used to demonstrate that changes in membrane structure drive lipid domain formation in mating single-cell organisms.  Chemical studies of lipid bilayers in both living and model systems have revealed that chemical composition is coupled to localized membrane structure.  However, it is not clear if the lipids that compose the membrane actively modify membrane structure or if structural changes cause heterogeneity in the surface chemistry of the lipid bilayer.  ToF-SIMS images of mating Tetrahymena thermophila, acquired at various stages during mating, can be used to demonstrate that lipid domain formation follows rather than precedes structural changes in the membrane.  Domains are formed in response to structural changes that occur during cell-to-cell conjugation.  This observation has wide implications in all membrane processes. \nThere is considerable interest in the unique properties of cluster ion projectiles and investigations of how they may be utilized to improve biological imaging.  A C60+ cluster ion projectile was employed for sputter cleaning biological surfaces to reveal spatio-chemical information obscured by contamination overlayers.  This protocol is used as a supplemental sample preparation method for time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) imaging of frozen and freeze dried biological materials.  Following the removal of nanometers of material from the surface using sputter cleaning; a frozen-patterned cholesterol film and a freeze-dried tissue sample were analyzed using ToF-SIMS imaging.  In both experiments, the chemical information was maintained after the sputter dose, due to the minimal chemical damage caused by C60+ bombardment.  The damage to the surface produced by freeze-drying the tissue sample was found to have a greater effect on the loss of cholesterol signal than the sputter-induced damage.  In addition to maintaining the chemical information, sputtering is not found to alter the spatial distribution of molecules on the surface.  This approach removes artifacts that may obscure the surface chemistry of the sample and are common to many biological sample preparation schemes for ToF-SIMS imaging.  In general, out results show that by removing these artifacts, the number of analyzable samples for SIMS imaging is greatly expanded.\nAlthough imaging with sub-cellular spatial resolution has been demonstrated, it is clear that the success of future experiments is limited by the ionization efficiency of the lipids, as well as limitations imposed by a coaxial ToF geometry.  Considerable work has been done in the lab, to address these limitations.  This effort has resulted in the development of a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal ToF instrument equipped with a C60+ primary ion source.  The capabilities and potential of this new platform will greatly increase the contributions of SIMS to the biological sciences.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4851], "author_name_tesi": "Piehowski, Paul David", "last_name_ssi": "Piehowski", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing", "Andrew Ewing", "Nicholas Winograd", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Carlo G Pantano", "Michael Heien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Ewing, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Michael Heien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cholesterol", "ToF-SIMS", "Single Cell Analysis", "Imaging Mass Spectrometry", "Cell Membrane"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FOSTERING PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT: A CRITICAL ACTION RESEARCH STUDY OF TITLE I PARENTS' PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS\n\n\n", "id": "8192", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2869", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis qualitative action research study used a critical perspective to explore Title I\nparents\u2019 perceptions of parental involvement in public schools and to foster awareness\namong Title I parents about individual and societal factors that influence parental\ninvolvement in school sponsored activities.

At the finest scales, its immediate effects on vegetation include killing of live vegetation and the consumption of dead organic debris.  At the scale of one to many hectares, it drives variability in vegetation composition and structure.  Heterogeneity in fire behavior and effects are not driven solely by the vegetation itself.  Fire interacts with weather, climate and climate teleconnections, past human management of forested landscapes, and with topography. The effect of topography on heterogeneity in fire behavior and effects is not well knows, and some evidence is contradictory.  I employ a neutral modeling approach generate an examine landscape scale patterns of fire intensity and fire effects.  Broadly, I address three main research questions: 1) what is the distribution of surface and canopy fuels in LVNP, and how do they vary with topography? 2) what is the effect of topography on landscape level heterogeneity in neutral models of fireline intensity and fire type? 3) Is topography able to explain heterogeneity in the observed severity of historic and contemporary fires and is it able to explain heterogeneity in modeled fireline intensity?  I accomplish this in stages. I use plot level data from 223 plots and 669 hemispherical photographs to assess the effect of topography\u2014elevation, slope, and aspect\u2014on the distribution of both surface and canopy fuels. Then I develop ten remotely sensed variables from Landast imagery and five topographic variables\u2014elevation, slope, aspect, local topographic position, and landscape position\u2014from the National Elevation Dataset.   I use a Random Forest algorithm to model and then predictively map canopy fuels.  In the second part, I model fire burning through homogenously distributed fuels at the 80th, 90th, and 97th percentile fuel moisture conditions and for a range of wind scenarios.  This set of simulations forms the base of our neutral model expectations and is analyzed for the effect of topography.   Finally, we map historic patches of high intensity fire effects from geo-referenced aerial photographs and extract severity data from remotely sensed images of recent fires.  We compare the topographic conditions of these real high severity patches with information on high intensity fire from the neutral model approach to assess how important topography is in explaining the distribution of different severities.  Our results show that slope angle is the most important variable for determining modeled fireline intensity, but that elevation and local topographic position are the most important variables for explaining the distribution of observed locations of high severity fire.  These result support our conclusion that some patches of vegetation may be \u2018fixed in space\u2019 through the interaction of fire with topography and fuels. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [79], "author_name_tesi": "Pierce, Andrew D", "last_name_ssi": "Pierce", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor", "Alan H Taylor", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Kenneth James Davis", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan H Taylor, Committee Chair", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Kenneth James Davis, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["random forest", "fire behavior modeling", "vegetation dynamics", "neutral model", "landscape ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Organizational Culture and Professionalism: An Assessment of the Professional Culture of the U.

Instead, the theory postulates that cultural norms, values, beliefs, and assumptions provide unconscious guidance and direction, and consequently, the subsequent behavior of organizational members.  If you want to be able to comprehend the current behavior of an organization as well as to reasonably anticipate its future actions then you must be able to understand the deep basic underlying assumptions that comprise the abstract concept of organizational culture (Schein, 1999).</p>  \n<p>Organizational culture can be found at every level of an organization, and since organizational members are multicultural entities understanding an organization\u2019s culture is significant \u201cbecause the beliefs, values, and behavior of individuals are often understood only in the context of people\u2019s cultural identities\u201d (Schein, 1999, p. 14).  Consequently, the long-term strategic decisions made by the senior leaders of an organization are influenced by their multicultural background, but especially by the organization in which they have spent the bulk of their life, such as members of professional organizations like doctors, lawyers, and military officers.  Professional organizations exist in a competitive environment where their social jurisdiction and legitimacy can only be supported or perpetuated as long as they maintain their expertise over an area of abstract knowledge that society perceives as important (Freidson, 1970, 1986; Abbott, 1988; Burk, 2002).  Since organizational culture is hypothesized to have a considerable impact on organizational behavior and because of the relative scarcity of literature discussing the impact that organizational culture may have on the development of professional leaders this study attempts to examine the congruence between organizational culture and the professional leadership and managerial skills of professional leaders.  Specifically, this study examines the U.S. Army culture and its senior leaders.</p>\n<p>This research strongly suggests that there is a lack of congruence between the U.S. Army professional culture and the professional development programs of the Army\u2019s senior level leaders.  This conclusion is based on empirical data that indicate that the future leaders of the Army profession believe that they operate on a day-to-day basis in a profession whose culture is characterized by an overarching desire for stability and control, formal rules and policies, coordination and efficiency, goal and results oriented, and hard-driving competitiveness.  Emphasizing this lack of cultural congruence, the respondents of this study also indicated that the Army\u2019s professional culture should be one that emphasizes flexibility, discretion, participation, human resource development, innovation, creativity, risk-taking, and a long-term emphasis on professional growth and the acquisition of new professional knowledge and skills, which is more aligned with the Army\u2019s strategic external environment.</p>\n<p>One of the principal reasons for the popular interest in the study of organizational culture is to determine the linkage between it and organizational performance (Berrio, 2003).  This study has reviewed a previously assumed but unverified connection between organizational culture and professional development.  It has uncovered a lack of congruence between the dominant type of organizational culture of the U.S. Army and the professional managerial / leadership skills of its senior level leaders.  This observed lack of congruence may be inhibiting performance and unconsciously perpetuating a cycle of caution and an over reliance on stability and control.  The U.S. Army Crusader story, outlined in the Prologue of this study, is illustrative of an organization that emphasizes stability and control and that attempts to comprehend the ambiguity of the future through an unconscious reliance upon the successful solutions employed in the past.</p>\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2682], "author_name_tesi": "Pierce, James Gerard", "last_name_ssi": "Pierce", "middle_name_ssi": "Gerard", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Plant", "Steven Ames Peterson", "Frances T.

Borges's \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\" (1940), Anna Seghers's Transit (1944), Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962) becomes a metaphor for caesura and an extension of exilic space. It is my contention that the presence of the blank page in these tales forces the first-person narrators to actively explore, and ultimately to choose between, two narrative desires: reconnection to history or recommencement upon the blank page. I further argue that these two narrative desires result in different strategies of narrative- building and history-making: one end-directed and one that relies upon a postponed conclusion. Though each narrator faces the same choice, the vacillation between reconnection and recommencement plays itself out in different ways. The nameless narrator in Anna Seghers's Transit, for example, opts for reconnection, while Charles Kinbote of Pale Fire chooses recommencement. \"J. L. Borges\" of \"Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,\" however, vanishes at the end of the story, thereby leaving the question of reconnection or recommencement to the reader, who must now decide how to read the story. The question of whether to embrace or postpone ending, furthermore, is similar to the choice that confronts Odysseus upon Calypso's island. Considering the first-person narrators' relationship to the blank page, which acts as a metaphorical Calypso's island, allows for an examination of the narrators' relationship to history, both their own and that of others.

In this research, concepts rather than datasets are treated as the primitive elements of scientific inquiry.  A model for scientific concepts is developed that incorporates representation of (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time.

Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information.

Land link programs have multiplied to almost 50 programs across the U.S. since the first was founded in 1990, and 19 programs serve the 11-state Northeast U.S. region. This research focuses on 17 Northeast land link programs and their participants to better understand who joins the programs, what participants\u2019 goals and expectations are when they join, and how land link programs work to facilitate strong partnerships between seekers and owners. Semi-structured interviews with 16 key informant staff members and an online survey of 271 farmland seekers and 104 farmland owners who have joined a land link program provide the data for this study. The results analyze participant characteristics and the types of opportunities sought and offered, and assess the contributions of land link programs toward supporting sustainable land access opportunities for the next generation of farmers. The findings show that seekers and owners have similar motives for joining land link programs, but often have unclear, differing or even conflicting mental models, or goals and expectations, of what farming will entail on a property. However, the results also point to several ways that land link programs work to facilitate positive relationships during the \u201cmatchmaking\u201d process. I conclude that the interpersonal aspects of a match relationship are not always an explicit programmatic focus, but land link programs\u2019 work to support participants in this way is essential to positive partnerships between farmland seekers and owners. This research also contributes to the literature about farmer and team mental models by considering the landlord-tenant relationship, as well as to the literature about farmer neighboring at the rural-urban interface by examining neighboring needs within the context of the landlord-tenant relationship.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9120], "author_name_tesi": "Pillen, Leslie Renae", "last_name_ssi": "Pillen", "middle_name_ssi": "Renae", "first_name_ssi": "Leslie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Clare Hinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Clare Hinrichs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Beginning farmers", "Land access", "Sustainable agriculture", "Land link programs", "Northeast U.S."]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Transhumanism: Evolutionary Logic, Rhetoric, and the Future", "id": "11800", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project traces the discursive formation called \u201ctranshumanism\u201d through vari- ous incarnations in twentieth century science, philosophy, and science fiction. While subject to no single, clear definition, I follow most of the major thinkers in the topic by defining transhumanism as a discourse surrounding the view of human beings as subject to ongoing evolutionary processes. Humanism, from Descartes forward, has histori- cally viewed the human as stable; transhumanism, instead, views humans as constantly evolving and changing, whether through technological or cultural means. The degree of change, the direction of said change, and the shape the species will take in the distant future, however, are all topics upon which there is little consensus in transhuman circles.\nIn tracing this discourse, I accomplish a number of things. First, previously dis- parate zones of academic inquiry\u2013poststructural philosophy, science studies, literary modernism and postmodernism, etc.\u2013are shown to be united by a common vocabulary when viewed from the perspective of the \u201cevolutionary futurism\u201d suggested by tran- shuman thinkers. Second, I provide a window on the rhetorically strategies and philo- sophical features of an increasingly pervasive cultural discourse around contemporary transhumanists such as Ray Kurzweil and his politically influential followers. Third, I recover the works of several forgotten transhuman thinkers who have much to contribute to an ongoing and vibrant conversation about the future of humanity.\nUltimately, my project provides a framework for thinking about the rhetorical arguments being made about the future of humanity during the 20th and 21st centuries while also arguing for the construction of the future as a rhetorical act itself.

Precision feeding has been an interesting alternative to traditional ad-libitum, high forage diets fed to heifers. Precision feeding is an economical way to raise heifers that modifies physiological and nutritional responses, making heifers more efficient without affecting growth, first lactation milk production, or the animal in any way that we are aware. The literature available has provided information about dietary crude protein, optimal N intake, and diet forage-to-concentrate ratio (F:C) in precision feeding, but still more information is necessary. In the present dissertation, three experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of starch, neutral detergent fiber (NDF) source, fiber digestibility, and rate of passage in precision feeding dairy heifers.\nThe first experiment had two objectives: evaluate effects of starch concentration on digestibility and rumen fermentation and compare two sources of trace minerals (TM; inorganic, ITM, and organic, OTM, form) on digestibility and rumen fermentation. Eight rumen cannulated dairy heifers (15.4 \u00b1 0.8 mo of age and 438.31 \u00b1 18.08 kg of body weight) were subject to a split-plot, 4 \u00d7 4 Latin Square design with 19-d periods; 15 d adaptation and 4 d sampling. The whole-plot factor was type of TM; organic as proteinates (OTM) or inorganic sulfates (ITM), and the subplot was starch level (3.5, 12.9, 22.3, and 31.7%). Results of this experiment supported the hypothesis that the type of TM affects rumen bacteria populations and produces responses in ruminal fermentation. Digestibility of dry matter (DM), NDF, acid detergent fiber (ADF), hemicellulose, and starch was not affected by treatments. The OTM decreased rumen pH and increased total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and butyrate concentration. This can be explained by the lower time consuming the ration with OTM, which led to a faster fermentation. Also we hypothesize as the higher bioavailability of OTM suggests a faster utilization of the TM and accelerated replication of ruminal micro-organisms, stimulating ruminal fermentation and VFA production. Butyrate was also linearly increased as starch level increased. In general, TM excretion was not affected by type of TM. Plasma TM concentration was not different by treatment except for Mn, which was higher for OTM. However, mineral intake was reduced in OTM, but blood concentration was not different between TM types. These results suggest that OTM have higher TM absorption compared with the ITM. On the other hand, urine and total manure excretion were higher for ITM, suggesting that ITM stimulated water intake and produce more manure. In summary, the type of TM affected rumen fermentation such that OTM was absorbed to a greater extent than ITM, suggesting higher bioavailability for this form of TM. \nThe objective of the second experiment was to evaluate sorghum silage (SS), including digestibility and fermentation parameters, in precision-fed dairy heifers. Eight Holstein heifers (13.7 \u00b1 0.6 mo of age and 364.8 \u00b1 17.64 kg of body weight) fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a replicated 4 \u00d7 4 Latin Square design; treatments were 4 levels of F:C (85:15, 75:25, 65:35, 55:45). When the concentrate proportion of the diet increased, heifers tended to improve feed efficiency, primarily due to lower DM intake (DMI) with the same average daily gain (ADG) over diets with a high proportion of forage. Rumen pH was affected by F:C, decreasing as the proportion of concentrate increased in the diet since heifers spent less time consuming feed. However, pH was never lower than 5.7 in diets with F:C 55:45, and fiber digestibility was not affected. Volatile fatty acid proportion was slightly influenced by treatment, where butyrate increased as concentrate increased in the diet. Dry matter and starch digestibility were affected by F:C and were improved in diets with more concentrate. Neutral detergent fiber, ADF, and hemicellulose digestibility were not affected by F:C. Wet and dry feces were reduced linearly as F:C decreased, but total manure was not affected by treatment due to increased urine production on high concentrate diets. In the in situ analysis, corn silage had a faster rate of digestion for DM and NDF than SS. This result suggests that the overall digestion of SS was diminished, probably because of the high NDF. Brown mid-rib SS can effectively be fed in precision diets for dairy heifers. Specifically in this study, the 65:35 F:C presented better performance based on rumen fermentation, VFA, rumen pH, digestibility, and feed efficiency. \n\tThe third experiment was conducted with the objective to compare ad-libitum vs. precision feeding diets with two forages and different levels of NDF to evaluate rumen fermentation, diet digestibility, feed efficiency, and digesta passage rate. Eight Holstein heifers (18.4 \u00b1 0.6 mo and 457.2 \u00b1 27.29 kg BW) fitted with rumen cannulas were used in a two-factor, split-plot, Latin Square design with 19-d periods, 14 d of adaptation and 5 d of sampling. The whole-plot factor was feeding system with ad-libitum or precision feeding and 4 heifers in each plot. The subplot included 2 factors: forage quality (low quality: grass hay, LFQ; high quality: corn silage, HFQ) and NDF content (high NDF, 48 % HNDF; low NDF, 39.8 %, LNDF). In this study we showed that the reduction in DMI for precision feeding diets improved feed efficiency in comparison with ad-libitum diets for dairy heifers. We observed that HFQ diets increased DMI, resulting in altered feed efficiency due to changes in intake based on fiber intake. Precision-fed diets resulted in a lower minimum rumen pH than ad-libitum diets, but the amount of time spent at the minimum pH was not great enough to reduce fiber digestion or rumen fermentation. Ad-libitum diets resulted in lower mean pH than precision-fed diets, but the rumen pH was more consistent throughout the day than in precision feeding, where rapid fermentation resulted when heifers ate much of their daily diet within a small amount of time. This effect was stronger when corn silage was the forage component of the diet. Also, we observed that HNDF diets presented higher minimum pH, suggesting that the presence of additional fiber stimulates rumination and buffers the rumen. Overall, VFA proportions were not affected by the type of diet but were clearly modified by forage quality, where grass hay diets had higher proportions of acetate and corn silage diets higher proportions of propionate. Overall, apparent total tract digestibility was not affected by the type of diet; however, DM digestibility increased with HFQ and decreased with HNDF level. In situ digestibility was affected by forage quality and NDF level, where grass hay diets resulted in a greater 48 h rumen degradation than corn silage. Rate of passage was not affected by type of diet 22 h after feeding, but it was highly affected with the rumen at maximum capacity, 3 to 4 h after feeding. In this study, ad-libitum diets had higher passage rate than precision diets for the nutrients analyzed. Rate of digestion was affected by forage quality in the post-feeding evaluation, indicating that corn silage diets had higher digestion rates than grass hay diets. This suggests that higher amounts of indigestible NDF reduced the digestion capacity of the rumen. With the results obtained in this study, we can state that the retention time for precision-fed diets was higher than ad-libitum diets and could lead an increased rumen digestion of nutrients. Also, grass hay diets had a higher retention time compared to corn silage diets. This effect was more significant in the precision-fed heifers. In addition, fluid dilution rate was higher for the ad-libitum diets. Grass hay diets presented a higher fluid dilution rate than corn silage-based diets.\n\tIn summary, the three factors analyzed in this study affect ruminal fermentation, rumen pH, nutrient digestion, and rate of passage, but the most important result was the difference in feed efficiency presented in the precision feeding diets that could lead to a reduction in the cost of raising dairy heifers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13699], "author_name_tesi": "Pino San Martin, Felipe Humberto", "last_name_ssi": "Pino San Martin", "middle_name_ssi": "Humberto", "first_name_ssi": "Felipe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Chad Daniel Dechow", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Gregory Wayne Roth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Dissertation Advisor", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Chad Daniel Dechow, Committee Member", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heifers", "precision feeding", "starch", "passage rate", "digestibility", "rumen fermentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "\"The image is a girl, so the poster must be too\": Understanding how visual media affects gender perception online", "id": "14124atp136", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14124", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social media platforms that require the inclusion of visual media for full community involvement (i.e. Instagram, Tinder, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular in today\u2019s digital society.

Adolescents and young adults (15-24 years) in the United States have the highest incidence of STDs compared to all other age groups and have been the focus of many preventative measures. However, the focus is on urban populations, thus rural adolescents and young adults remain understudied in the area of risky sexual behavior and STDs. \n\tPurpose: The following dissertation is an ecological descriptive study analyzing chlamydia and gonorrhea rates among both rural adolescent (15-19 years) and rural young adult (20-24 years) populations as compared to urban adolescent and young adult populations. \n       Methods: The subsequent study utilized three datasets; the Pennsylvania National Electronic Database Surveillance System (PA-NEDSS), census statistics, and the Pennsylvania Center for Education Statistics National School Lunch Program dataset. This dissertation had two main aims. The first aim provided an overview of current Pennsylvania adolescent and young adult chlamydia and gonorrhea rates, both rural and urban, using negative binomial regressions. The second aim provided an analysis of county level data, both rural and urban, over time using a repeated measures analysis to determine change in the rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea over an 11-year period. \n        Results: This study demonstrated that rates of chlamydia were higher in rural 18-19, 20, and 21-year-old populations for the years 2011 through 2014 as compared to urban populations in Pennsylvania when controlling for poverty and gender. The second outcome demonstrated that among all age groups studied, a significant increase of chlamydia and gonorrhea rates for both males and females were seen in selected counties of PA. While the increase was noted, select counties in both rural and urban settings also had decreases in STD rates.\n       Conclusions: This dissertation provided empirical evidence that STD rates, specifically chlamydia and gonorrhea, are not only higher in rural areas, but have also increased from 2004 until 2014. The results of this study document the need for further research to better understand the societal and behavioral mechanisms of disease acquisition, with special emphasis on primary prevention methods, in particular in rural areas of Pennsylvania in these young age groups.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11803], "author_name_tesi": "Pinto, Casey ", "last_name_ssi": "Pinto", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Casey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorah D Dorn", "Lorah D Dorn", "Susan Jayne Loeb", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Ping Du"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorah D Dorn, Dissertation Advisor", "Lorah D Dorn, Committee Chair", "Susan Jayne Loeb, Committee Member", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member", "Ping Du, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adolescents", "Young Adults", "Chlamydia", "Gonorrhea", "STD"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PHYLOGENETICS, POPULATION GENETICS AND ECOLOGY TO\nUNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTION OF CORAL-ALGAL MUTUALISMS\n", "id": "11600", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2707", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Scleractinian corals form mutualistic associations with dinoflagellates in the genus\nSymbiodinium. This association has allowed scleractinians, over geological time, to\ncreate the framework of one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on the planet;\nthe coral reefs. While major environmental changes appear to have caused significant\nchanges in partner combinations, there is considerable data to indicate that coevolutionary\nprocesses lead to high host-symbiont specificity and possibly speciation.\nThe study of coral-Symbiodinium associations can be use to understand processes of\nspeciation and the relative importance of biotic (host-specialization) and abiotic factors\n(isolation by distance, environmental extremes) in the evolution and diversification of\nboth symbiotic partners.\nThe objective of this dissertation is to elucidate the ecological and\nenvironmental/geographic factors that are important in the co-evolution of coral-algal\nmutualisms and how these interactions result in the formation of specific associations and\nthe diversification of corals and algae. The first part of the dissertation is focused on\nexamining the genetic diversity of corals in the genus Pocillopora throughout the Indo-\nPacific Ocean and how their symbionts differ with regard to the genetic identity of the\nanimal in combination with geographic location and regional environmental conditions.\nThe second part is designed to assess the influence of host identity and geography on the\ngene flow among populations of Symbiodinium fitti in the Caribbean.\nPocillopora is a common coral genus widely distributed throughout the Indo-\nPacific Ocean and the Red Sea. Pocillopora spp. are major reef building corals in the\nlarge, isolated Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) region. Shallow coral communities in the\nTEP extend from the Gulf of California to Ecuador. Approximately seven cosmopolitan\n(P. damicornis, P. verrucosa, P. meandrina, P. ligulata, P. woodjonesi. P. eydouxi and\nP. capitata) and two endemic (P. effusus and P. inflata) species of Pocillopora\nrecognized based on morphology are found in the TEP. Many species within the genus\nare phenotypically plastic to the extent that colony and branch morphology between\ndifferent species may overlap creating uncertainty in their taxonomy. To examine this\ndiversity more carefully (Chapter One), genetic analyses using nuclear (ITS2) and\nmitochondrial (ORF) DNA sequence data, and microsatellite markers were employed to\ninvestigate species boundaries. Colonies were collected at several locations over a broad\nlatitudinal range throughout the TEP (Sea of Cortez, Banderas Bay and Oxaca in Mexico,\nClipperton Atoll, Panama and Galapagos). The results identified only three distinct\ngenetic entities of Pocillopora that do not corresponded to morphology. The most\ncommon genetic type, designated Type 1, was found throughout the entire region. A\nsecond type (Type 3) was identified in equatorial regions (Panama and Galapagos) and a\nthird (Type 2), most likely a rare endemic, occurred only at the isolated Clipperton atoll.\nEach of these genetic \u201ctypes\u201d associated with different species of symbiont: Type 1\nassociated with Symbiodinium C1b-c and S. glynni, Type 3 with S. C1d-c and Type 2\nwith S. C1ee. Genetic, ecological and biogeographic analyses suggested the diversity of\nPocillopora in the TEP is less than previously defined exclusively on\nmacromorphological features (i.e. colony size and branching patterns). Based on these\niv\nfindings, it appears that two of the three species are potentially susceptible to climate\nchange, as they do not associate with the thermally tolerant S. glynni.\nContradictions between morphologically defined species and their genetic make\nup in Pocillopora from the TEP indicated the need for a major revision of the taxonomic\nstatus of Pocillopora spp. In an attempt to assess the diversity of the genus Pocillopora\n(Chapter Two), collection and analyses of samples from various locations in the Pacific\n(Hawaii, Australia, Thailand, Palau and Taiwan) and Indian Ocean (Tanzania) were\nperformed. The results indicate Pocillopora is composed of at least eight well-defined\nspecies with little or no correspondence to morphological features. Inconsistencies\nbetween morphology and genetics led to revise the taxonomy for the Pocillopora.\nAccurate species delineations are important to understand the biology, ecology\nand evolution of life as well as to improve conservation. An example of this is presented\nby studying the clonal and reproductive structure of Pocillopora type 1 from two close\ncoral communities in the Gulf of California, off La Paz, Mexico (Chapter Three).\nMicrosatellite loci data analyses revealed that although gene flow is present, P. type 1 has\na different reproductive structure on each reef. The exposed reefs, with more high action\nand a wider platform, is dominated by sexual reproduction while the enclosed, more\nprotected area is highly clonal. Although comparisons with previous studies are not\npossible (i.e. different methodologies or molecular markers), both reproductive strategies\nhave been found in Pocillopora and none seems related to marginality of the populations.\nHost selection leads to the diversification of specialized symbiont populations and\ncan be an important step in sympatric speciation. Species radiations in at least two\nidentified Symbiodinium clades (B and C) suggested the diversity of the group alternates\nbetween low (mostly generalist) and high (mostly specialist) number of species.\nSymbiodinium clade A showed a similar pattern of species diversification. Analysis of 10\nmicrosatellite loci showed structured populations of Symbiodinium fitti harbored by\ndifferent coral hosts (Chapter four). Populations found in Stephanocoenia intersepta were\ngenetically different from those harbored by Acropora species. Among Acropora spp,\nsymbiont populations were not completely isolated from each other with some clonal\nlines present in both A. palmata and A. cervicornis. Analyses of populations harbored by\nthe same host at different locations showed geographical isolation between S. fitti\npopulations from different locations (Colombia, Panama and Mexico). Symbiodinium\nspeciation seems to be driven by a combination of host selection and\nenvironmental/geographical isolation.\nThe conclusions of this research are: (1) information from the dinofalgellate algae\ncan be use to delineate coral species in combination with phylogenetic and population\ngenetic analyses of the host. (2) Coral-algal associations change over geographical ranges\nsuggesting a geographical mosaic of co-evolution with host populations widely\ndistributed and symbiont populations more isolated. (3) Sympatric coral species\neffectively reduce gene flow between populations of Symbiodinium, and (4) Host identity\nis a major factor in the diversification of Symbiodinium species.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2702], "author_name_tesi": "Pinzon, Jorge Hernando", "last_name_ssi": "Pinzon", "middle_name_ssi": "Hernando", "first_name_ssi": "Jorge", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. T.

We identified two potential mechanisms by which activation of PKC results in rod differentiation. First, activation of PKC with either IGF1 or PMA significantly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, a molecule that has been shown to promote progenitor cells proliferation and self renewal. In contrast, inhibition of PKC resulted in higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 accompanied by delayed cell cycle exit of progenitor (proliferating cell nuclear antigen or PCNA positive) cells. This suggests that activation of PKC promotes the transition of progenitor cells from proliferation to cell specification. Second, activation of PKC causes modification of epigenetic markers that may result in changes of gene expression necessary for rod photoreceptor differentiation.\nFinally, we identified IGF1 as one physiological signal that during photoreceptor development triggers activation of PKC. We found that contrary to adult retinas, in neonatal retinas, when IGF1 binds to its receptor, the tyrosine kinase of the IGF1 receptor does not activate PI3K, and the absence of PI3K activity results in activation of PKC and rod development.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1255], "author_name_tesi": "Pinzon-Guzman, Carolina  ", "last_name_ssi": "Pinzon-Guzman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Carolina ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Colin James Barnstable", "Colin James Barnstable", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang", "James Robert Connor", "Alistair J Barber", "Thomas Wright Gardner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Colin James Barnstable, Dissertation Advisor", "Colin James Barnstable, Committee Chair", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Committee Member", "Thomas Wright Gardner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["retinal development", "Photoreceptor differentiation", "PKC"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Evolution of multigene families: histone and major histocompatibility complex genes", "id": "6047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4834", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To understand the mode and mechanism of evolution of multigene families, I studied the evolutionary pattern of the highly conserved histone H3 and H4 and the highly divergent MHC gene families. (1) The primary purpose of the study of the histone H3 gene family was to investigate whether this family has evolved following the model of concerted evolution as was claimed by some previous authors. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of H3 genes from animals, plants and fungi indicated that while H3 protein sequences are highly conserved even between different kingdoms, the level of nucleotide sequence divergence at silent sites is generally very high and often close to the saturation level. These results suggest that the high degree of conservation of H3 proteins is primarily caused by purifying selection and that H3 nucleotide sequences evolve following the model of birth-and-death evolution. This study also suggested that the replication-dependent H3 genes may have evolved from the replication-independent H3 genes. (2) Histone H4 protein is among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes. Statistical and phylogenetic analyses of the protein and DNA sequences of H4 genes from various organisms showed that the evolutionary pattern of this gene family is essentially the same as that of the H3 gene family. That is, the sequence homogeneity of H4 proteins is primarily caused by purifying selection, whereas nucleotide sequences evolve following the birth-and-death model of evolution. My study also indicated that all five classes of histone genes (H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) were derived from archaebacteria rather than from eubacteria and that they diverged at nearly the same time before the separation of eukaryotic kingdoms, protists, plants, fungi and animals. (3) It has been suggested that MHC genes are subject to birth-and-death evolution with a high rate of gene turnover, but the rate of gene turnover has never been studied. To obtain some insight into this problem, I estimated the time of occurrence of gene duplication events that generated new MHC loci as well as the times of divergence of allelic lineages in polymorphic MHC class I loci of primate species. The results showed that one of these loci, namely locus F, diverged from the other loci about 46-66 million years ago (MYA). Other class I loci such as classical locus C in great apes and the duplicated B locus in macaques have appeared relatively recently about 21-28 MYA. The major diversification of class I loci was estimated to have occurred about 35-49 MYA, which is before the time of separation of Old World -New World monkeys. The most recent common ancestors of different allelic lineages at the A, B and C loci in humans were estimated to have appeared at least 14-19, 10-15 and 13-17 MYA, respectively. These results suggest that the rate of gene turnover in primate MHC class I genes is indeed quite rapid, as was previously conjectured.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4811], "author_name_tesi": "Piontkivska, Olena ", "last_name_ssi": "Piontkivska", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Olena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Masatoshi Nei", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "David Michael Geiser", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Masatoshi Nei, Committee Chair", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["histone", "H3", "H4", "multigene family", "concerted evolution", "birth-and-death evolution", "purifying selection", "MHC", "class I", "divergence time", "primates"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Thermal and geologic constraints on the Cretaceous-to-neogene tectonic development of the Klamath Mountains, Northern California", "id": "14504", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5166", "abstract_tesi": "The Klamath Mountains Province (KMP) of northern California and southern Oregon straddles a fundamental transition in the North American plate boundary, and as such its Neogene to recent tectonic history provides a window into the evolution of the plate boundary as it undergoes the transition from subduction to translation. The Klamath province hosts some of the highest topography along the convergent boundary, but the timing and mechanisms of topographic development are unknown, and thus whether this development is linked to modern plate boundary processes has not been clear. The uplift history is accompanied by extensional faulting, primarily in the form of a regional detachment with the upper plate displaced to the south, which overprints the eastern part of the KMP at a high angle to the accretionary fabric of the region. The detachment appears to have played a significant role in the tectonic development of the KMP, and some constraints on its timing exist, but the specific relationship between this extension and the development of high topography is unknown. A suite of new apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) ages, supplemented by vitrinite reflectance data along with previously determined geologic constraints, gives insight into the timing and contributions of tectonic and erosional exhumation in the eastern KMP.\n\nThe new data set includes multiple single-grain AHe ages for each of 23 new samples collected throughout the central and southeastern KMP, expanding the spatial coverage and resolution beyond the 8 previously published multiple-grain ages from the region. Ages for most samples range from 15-45 Ma. Those in the exposed lower plate of the detachment, which corresponds to the highest topography in the region, show a north-to-south younging pattern that appears to represent the influence of the detachment; ages outside this core show roughly uniform ages of ~20-25 Ma in the northwest and ~25-35 Ma in the southeast. The new AHe ages 1) imply a complex exhumation history, with the detachment as only one of multiple drivers of Eocene and younger exhumation, and 2) record province-wide exhumation in late Oligocene-early Miocene time, substantially prior to development of current plate boundary geometry. By incorporating these new data with detailed forward thermal modeling that assesses a diverse range of exhumation scenarios, the Cenozoic extensional and exhumation history of the KMP is further constrained, contributing to our understanding of how this key region fits into the larger picture of the plate boundary.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5138], "author_name_tesi": "Piotraschke, Rachel ", "last_name_ssi": "Piotraschke", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["western U.S. tectonics", "low-temperature thermochronology", "detachment fault", "Klamath Mountains", "apatite (U-Th)/He"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Azimuthal Hydrogen Concentration Factor using the Bison Fuel Performance Code", "id": "23621", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10863", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrogen can enter nuclear reactors because of the corrosion reaction. Hydrogen that is picked up by nuclear reactor cladding may become heterogeneously distributed due to concentration gradients as described by Fick\u2019s law and temperature gradients as described by the Soret effect. Understanding hydrogen behavior is important for ensuring the safety and integrity of a nuclear reactor, since hydrogen that precipitates as hydrides may weaken cladding and lower ductility. This phenomenon has been studied by many researchers since the start of the nuclear industry. \n\tIn order to predict hydrogen and hydride distributions, computer codes are essential because of the complexity of models and reactor conditions. A hydrogen transport and precipitation model was created and simulations were previously conducted that predicted the radial and axial distributions of hydrogen and hydrides under various conditions. The current objective of this study and goal of this project is to simulate various azimuthally dependent hydrogen and hydride distributions. This is done through the use of BISON fuel performance that is indirectly coupled to Penn State maintained thermal-hydraulics code, COBRA-TF and the neutronics code, Deterministic Core Analysis based on Ray Tracing (DeCART). \n\tThe goal of the azimuthal simulations is to produce boundary condition in which hydrogen and hydride distributions are most heterogeneous. The three simulations highlighted in this study include modeling a 4x4 pin array where a water rod is located near the rod of interest to produce a large thermal gradient, a partially inserted control rod located near the rod of interest to produce a thermal gradient based on differences in power, and modeling cladding in which a portion of the oxide has broken off producing a thermal gradient in the spalled region. A new azimuthal mesh and associated boundaries was created in order to simulate these scenarios. The water rod and control rod simulations used COBRA-TF and DeCART outputs as boundary conditions for the BISON input deck. In each of the simulations, the hydrogen in solid solution diffused to the colder regions, as anticipated, leading to hydride precipitation in specific favored regions. This resulted in a high concentration in hydride which we believe mimics real cases. Further work can be done to add more competing driving forces to the BISON fuel performance code such as the effect of applied stress on hydrogen and hydride distributions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10461], "author_name_tesi": "Piotrowski, Christopher Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Piotrowski", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Azimuthal Hydrogen Concentration", "BISON", "hydride"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Secure Communications in Sensor Networks", "id": "7569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4134", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sensor networks hold the promise to accomplish missions in hostile environments\nthat are not feasible to accomplish with any other system architecture. Consisting\nof hundreds to thousands of expendable computing nodes, a sensor network is capable\nof tolerating the loss of a significant portion of its nodes. The requirement\nof expendable sensor nodes necessitates usage of low cost hardware. Consequently,\napplications with security requirements must be carefully designed in order to circumvent\nthe heavy performance requirements associated with traditional security\ntechniques.\n\nIn this work, we consider the design and performance of distributed sensor network\nalgorithms that are designed to tolerate insider attacks, wherein individual\nnodes are compromised. When used in conjunction with cryptographic techniques\nspecifically crafted for low capability hardware, we find that sensor networks can\nbe designed to a high level of robustness against attack, despite limited security\nof individual sensor nodes. In this work we present three such algorithms: secure\nlocalization, use of secure clusterhead election to prevent energy attacks, and\ndetection of cloned nodes.\n\nLocalization is the process by which sensor nodes determine their physical location\nin the network based on receipt of position information from beacon nodes.\nExisting localization approaches are characterized by a lack of any security mechanisms\nor an inability to tolerate the compromise of beacon nodes. We address\nthese shortcomings with our Secure Localization with Attack Tolerance (SLAT)\nprotocol. In SLAT message authentication is used to prevent maliciously forged\nbeacon messages, while localization is designed to tolerate compromised beacons\nnodes. The degree to which a compromised beacon node can adversely effect nonbeacon\nnode location estimates is inversely proportional to the deviation from its\nactual distance. Through simulation, we have found that even large numbers of\nmalicious beacon nodes have minimal effect. For instance, we show that comproiii\nmising 40 out of 200 nodes only increases average localization error from 3 meters\nto 5 meters.\n\nThe ability of sensor nodes to enter a low power sleep mode is very useful for\nextending network longevity. We show how adversary nodes can exploit clustering\nalgorithms to ensure their selection as cluster heads for the purpose of launching\nattacks that prevent victim nodes from sleeping. We present two such attacks:\nthe barrage attack and the sleep deprivation attack. The barrage attack bombards\nvictim nodes with legitimate requests, whereas the sleep deprivation attack makes\nrequests of victim nodes only as often as is necessary to keep the victims awake.\nWe show that while the barrage attack causes its victims to spend slightly more\nenergy, it is more easily detected and requires more effort on behalf of the attacker.\nThus we have focused our research on the sleep deprivation attack. Our analysis\nindicates that this attack can nullify any energy savings obtained by allowing sensor\nnodes to enter sleep mode. We also analyze three separate methods for mitigating\nthis attack: the random vote scheme, the round robin scheme, and the hash-based\nscheme. We have evaluated these schemes based upon their ability to reduce the\nadversary\u2019s attack, the amount of time required to select a cluster head, and the\namount of energy required to perform each scheme. We have found that of the\nthree clustering methods analyzed, the hash-based scheme is the best at mitigating\nthe sleep deprivation attack.\n\nEfficient key management in sensor networks is a major research issue. Random\nkey predistribution security schemes are well-suited for use in sensor networks due\nto their low overhead. However, the security of a network using predistributed\nkeys can be compromised by cloning attacks. In this attack an adversary breaks\ninto a sensor node, reprograms it, and inserts several copies of it into the sensor\nnetwork. Cloning gives the adversary an easy way to build an army of malicious\nnodes which can be used to cripple the sensor network. We provide two methods\nfor detecting the presence of cloning given the network is utilizing a random key\npredistribution scheme. The first technique is a proof of concept which we have\nused to illustrate that the distribution of keys can be used to detect the presence\nof cloning. This method is based Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) graphs,\nwhich are a general purpose methodology used to evaluate detection schemes. The\nsecond technique is a detection algorithm, based upon hypothesis testing, which a\nsensor network could utilize to determine the presence of cloning.

An approach for automatic age estimation from facial images therefore has the potential for a number of practical applications.  Human beings develop the ability to accurately estimate age early in life, but automatic age estimation is very sensitive to factors such as race, gender, facial attachments such as glasses, beards, facial piercings, and other visually perceptive factors like attractiveness, thus making it one of the challenging problems in computer vision. In this thesis we develop computer vision and machine learning based approaches for extracting visual features from a human facial image and mapping those to an output label estimating the approximate age (in years) or age group (range of years) of the individual.\n\t\nWe develop an automatic eye localization algorithm which finds the coordinates of both the eye centers. These co-ordinates are used to register all the facial images into a common frame of reference. Such a localization algorithm is very useful in real world applications where information about eye-center is usually not available. We then extract feature descriptors that represent the facial image in a low dimensional space. In this thesis we have experimented with three different kinds of age relevant feature descriptors in order to capture the shape and texture information of facial images: Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and Gradient Orientation Pyramids (GOP).  \n\nWe then propose two machine learning pipelines for age estimation. First, we develop a hierarchical approach to estimate the age of the test image using two steps. In the first step we perform soft classification by separating the training data into age groups and using a kNN/SVM classifier to compute the probability of a new test image belonging to each of the age three groups. We then use Gaussian Process (GP) regression for the final age estimation.  Gaussian process regression is a Bayesian approach that computes the posterior density for the age of a test image given both the training and test data. GP produces confidence intervals for the age, thereby providing the user with more information.  Second, we develop expectation maximization (EM) framework to jointly address the issues of categorizing the training data points into groups and learning the hyper parameters of the Gaussian Process regression model corresponding to each group.  Unlike the earlier approaches where we manually categorize the training data into three groups based on age, this approach automatically groups the data.  \n\nWe test our methods on the publicly available FGNET aging database, a very popular and challenging database for testing facial aging based algorithms.  We evaluate our algorithms using the Leave One Person Out (LOPO) evaluation scheme. In LOPO we train the regressor on images of all the persons in the database except one, and test it on the images of that one person which have not been used in the training. We repeat this for all the people in our database and compute the error by averaging across errors from the individual testing rounds. This metric is known as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and has been used as the performance metric to evaluate performance of various features and our estimation algorithms.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8559], "author_name_tesi": "Pisupati, Venkata Soumya", "last_name_ssi": "Pisupati", "middle_name_ssi": "Soumya", "first_name_ssi": "Venkata", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert T Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert T Collins, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Age Estimation", "Hierarchical estimation", "Gaussian Processes", "EM algorithm", "Image registration", "Eye coordinate localization"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "SORPTION AND BIODEGRADATION OF IONIZABLE POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (IPAHs) IN ESTUARINE SEDIMENT\n", "id": "6127", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the first part of this research, adsorption of quinoline (pKa = 4.92) and background electrolyte (CaCl2) onto specimen kaolinite and montmorillonite were measured as a function of pH (3-7.5) and ionic strength (1-10 mM), and as a function of quinoline concentration (0.02-1.55 mM) at fixed pH values of maximum adsorption.  Maximum sorption of quinoline occurred at pH 3.5-4.0 for kaolinite, and pH 3.0-5.0 for montmorillonite.  At their respective pH values of maximum adsorption, the sorption capacity for quinoline was 100 times greater with montmorillonite than kaolinite on mass basis.  Selectivity coefficients, which were calculated from pH edge data, indicated selectivity for cationic quinoline (QH+) over Ca2+ was greater with montmorillonite (Kexc = 27 at pH 4) compared to kaolinite (Kexc = 1.6 at pH 4), and Kexc was not affected by ionic strength for either clay.  The results indicate the important role of charged siloxane sites in the adsorption of this N-heterocyclic contaminant.\nIn the second part of this research, sorption and biodegradation of structurally similar compounds of ionizable polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (IPAHs) in an estuarine sediment were studied.  The sorption of 16 IPAHs to the sediment was measured in synthetic estuarine water as a function of IPAH concentration (1-100 \u00b5M) at fixed ionic strength (0.4 M), pH (7.6\u00b10.2), and sediment concentration (0.371 g C kg-1 suspension) after a 24 h equilibration period.  Of the 16 IPAHs, 11 were naphthalene-based structures and five were quinoline-based structures.  Sorption data of all 16 IPAHs were best fitted using the Freundlich isotherm. A modified linear sorption isotherm was obtained from plots of the sorbed concentration [qe (&#61549;mol kg-1 C)] versus dissolved concentration [Ce (&#61549;mol L-1)] where the isotherm was not forced through the origin of the plot.  The modified linear sorption isotherm constant (Koc\u2019) was used to correlate IPAH sorption to IPAH physical, chemical, and molecular characteristics, with the objective to establish quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs) for this class of compounds.  Chemical structure (i.e., types and position of substituent groups) and adsorbate charge had a direct effect on sorption.  With respect to 1-naphthoic acid, sorption increased with the addition of ortho substituent groups and with increasing chain length of the 1-acid group.  Also with respect to 1-naphthoic acid, the greatest increase in sorption occurred with ortho hydroxy and aldehyde groups.  With respect to quinoline, sorption decreased with the addition of all substituent groups (except for nitro groups where sorption was unchanged) and with additional heterocyclic N atoms.  Anionic naphthalene-based compounds sorbed greater than neutral quinoline-based compounds.   For the naphthalene-based structures, log Koc\u2019 exhibited a positive correlation with water solubility (log Sw), a negative correlation with acid dissociation constant (pKa1), and no correlations with n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Kow) or first-order molecular connectivity index (1&#967;).  For the quinoline-based structures, log Koc\u2019 exhibited a positive correlation with log Kow, a negative correlation with log Sw, and no correlations with pKa1 or 1&#967;.\nBiodegradation experiments with 20 IPAHs (naphthalene-based and quinoline-based structures) were initially conducted with two pure cultures in order to select the most metabolically capable organism.  The two cultures included Neptunomonas naphthovorans (ATCC 700638), isolated from PAH-contaminated sediment in Puget Sound, WA, and unidentified NP-1, isolated from municipal wastewater in State College, PA.  The initial \u201cscreening\u201d experiments revealed that N. naphthovorans could biodegrade 11 of the 20 IPAHs, while NP-1 could biodegrade 9 of the 20 IPAHs.  Therefore, all further experiments were conducted with N. naphthovorans.  Experiments were conducted in synthetic estuarine water in the absence and presence of estuarine sediment (0.371 g C kg-1 suspension) at a constant initial IPAH concentration of 32 \u00b5M, at fixed ionic strength (0.4 M) and pH (7.6\u00b10.2).  Biodegradation kinetics for all 11 IPAHs were not universally well fit to a simple reaction-order model (e.g., zero-order or first-order), therefore, the percent final extent of biodegradation after 5 days (%FE; where high %FE corresponds to greater degradation) was used to compare biodegradability among the IPAHs, and to develop predictive QSARs.  The predictive QSARs showed that log %FE of IPAHs (naphthalene-based structure) exhibited poor positive correlations with log Sw and log Kow, negative correlation with pKa1; and no correlation with 1&#967;.  The presence of sediment resulted in reduced final extent of 3-hydroxy-7-methyl-2-naphthoic acid, 4-fluoro-2-naphthoic acid, quinoline, and quinoxaline but no effects on the final extent of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, 1,8-naphthaldehydic acid, and 6-amino-2-naphthoic acid.  A log Koc\u2019-log %FE (naphthalene-based structure) showed positive correlation. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4754], "author_name_tesi": "Pisutpaisal, Nipon ", "last_name_ssi": "Pisutpaisal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nipon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "William D Burgos", "John Michael Regan", "A Daniel Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "A Daniel Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["IONIZABLE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS", "BIODEGRADATION", "SORPTION", "QAUNTITATIVE STRUCTURE ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "REVISED MODELS OF THE CONTACT ACTIVATION BLOOD PLASMA-COAGULATION CASCADE", "id": "14448hxp21", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14448", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "About 25 percent of Americans are currently living with some form of cardiovascular disease with approximately 800,000 deaths each year. Millions of cardiovascular devices are used each year in the US. However, all biomaterials eventually lead to some form of thrombosis.  Therefore, surface engineering of biomaterials with improved hemocompatibility is an imperative, given the widespread global need for cardiovascular devices. Investigating the biochemical reaction of blood factor proteins in contact with an activation surface is the major purpose of these studies.  Research summarized in this thesis focuses on contact activation of FXI and FXII in buffer and blood plasma, a process usually referred to as autoactivation. \nIn Chapters 2 and 3, recent hematology literature combined with new theoretical and experimental results from our laboratory offers an updated version of blood plasma coagulation cascade biochemistry in vitro for use in the study of blood-biomaterial interactions. A revised version of the coagulation cascade is proposed that emphasizes a known role for FXI in controlling the time required to complete plasma coagulation after activation with hydrophilic procoagulant surfaces such as glass. Central to this revision is a \u201cthrombin (FIIa) amplification route\u201d that has been generally recognized in existing models of in vivo plasma coagulation cascade biochemistry but has been afforded the proper emphasis as a pivotal feedback loop that activates FXI in vitro, in a way similar to that known to occur in vivo. Thus, a connection between in vitro and in vivo coagulation is drawn. We propose that this thrombin amplification route is catalyzed by the substantial amount of FIIa generated in coagulating plasma that persists in serum prepared from coagulated plasma. This revision (Fig. 3.4) further includes an updated version (Fig. 3.5) of the contact activation phase mediated by surface activation of the Hageman factor known as FXII.\nIn Chapter 4, a contact activation of FXII in buffer solutions (i.e. in absence of plasma proteins) with hydrophilic and silanized-glass activators spanning the observed range of water wettability (hydrophilic to hydrophobic), shows no evidence based on high-resolution electrophoresis evaluating proteolytic cleavage of FXII into \u03b1FXIIa or \u03b2FXIIa. The autoactivation mixture contains only a single-chain protein with a molecular weight of ~80 kDa, confirming the previous finding of Oscar Runoff of a single-chain activated form of FXII that he called \u2018HFea\u2019. Functional assays have shown that these autoactivation products exhibit procoagulant potential (protease activity inducing clotting of blood) or amidolytic potential (cleaves amino bonds in             s-2302 chromogen but do not cause coagulation of plasma) or both amidolytic potential and procoagulant potential. Some of these proteins also have the remarkable potential to \u2018suppress autoactivation\u2019 (i.e. suppress creation of enzymes with procoagulant potential). It is thus hypothesized that autoactivation of FXII in the absence of plasma proteins generates not just a single type of activated conformer, as suggested by previous researchers, but rather an ensemble of conformer products with collective activity that varies with activator surface energy used in contact activation of FXII. Furthermore, reaction of \u03b1FXIIa with FXII in buffer solution does not produce additional \u03b1FXIIa by the putative autoamplification reaction FXII + FXIIa \uf0e0 2FXIIa as has been proposed in past literature to account for the discrepancy between chromogenic and plasma-coagulation assays for \u03b1FXIIa in buffer solution. Instead, net procoagulant activity measured directly by plasma-coagulation assays decreases systematically with increasing FXII solution concentration. Under the same reaction conditions, chromogenic assay reveals that net amidolytic activity increases with increasing FXII solution concentration. Thus, although autoamplification does not occur, it appears that there is some form of \u201cFXII self-reaction\u201d that influences the products of \u03b1FXIIa reaction with FXII. Electrophoretic measurements indicate that no proteolytic cleavage takes in this reaction leading us to conclude that change in activity is most likely due to change(s) in FXII conformation (with related change in enzyme activity).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15465], "author_name_tesi": "Pitakjakpipop, Harit ", "last_name_ssi": "Pitakjakpipop", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Harit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Blood coagulation", "FactorXII", "FactorXI", "Autoactivation Surface", "FactorXIIa"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF SUPPORT FOR Ni2P CATALYSTS ON HYDRODEOXYGENATION OF BIO-OIL USING ANISOLE AND GUAIACOL AS MODEL COMPOUNDS", "id": "13652pok5061", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13652", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bio-oil from thermal decomposition of biomass consists of a complex composition of oxygen-containing compounds in the form of hydroxyaldehydes, hydroxylketone, sugars and dehydrosugars, carboxylic acids, phenolic compounds, and water.  The high oxygen content leads to undesirable properties of the oil.  Consequently, bio-oil upgrading process such as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is required to reduce its oxygen content.  Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) is a hydrotreating process using hydrogen to remove oxygen (heteroatom) out of oxygenated compounds from bio-oil.  This work focused on the support effect of Ni2P catalysts on the hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil by using anisole as a model compound following a preliminary screening using guaiacol as a model compound.  Mono- and bimetallic metal phosphides were also tested in the preliminary screening on guaiacol HDO.  Ni2P shows excellent activity and selectivity to deoxygenated products when compared to other metal phosphides.  Subsequently, a series of bulk Ni2P and Ni2P loaded on CeO2, TiO2, and TiO2-CeO2 were prepared.  The CeO2, TiO2, and their mixed oxides were synthesized by urea precipitation.  The catalytic activities of the prepared catalysts were evaluated in anisole HDO.  The support performance of the oxides was compared with commercial low-surface area CeO2 and TiO2 (denoted as CeO2-L and TiO2-L, respectively) and also with SiO2, Al2O3, and activated carbon, which are extensively used as supports in petroleum refineries.  Among supported Ni2P catalysts, Ni2P/CeO2 provided the highest conversion of anisole under the same testing conditions.  At the same level of conversion, the Ni2P loaded on CeO2 from urea precipitation improved benzene selectivity of 4.2-fold superior to Ni2P/CeO2-L.  The results suggested that support tends to exhibit an important role in the hydrodeoxygenation pathway, which significantly influences catalyst performance and product selectivity in hydrodeoxygenation.  The catalysts were extensively characterized using XRD, STEM-EDX, N2 adsorption-desorption, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, CO chemisorption, and XPS. \nTPR characterizations showed that using CeO2 or TiO2-CeO2 as a support makes nickel phosphate easier to reduce.  It is likely possible that electron transfer from the conducting band and the surface reduction of metal oxides lower the reduction temperature of nickel phosphate.  The XPS revealed the metal-support interaction of nickel with TiO2, CeO2 and TiO2-CeO2 mixed oxides from the binding energy shift of nickel in 2p region. The binding energy of nickel significantly shifts toward lower binding energy for Ni2P/CeO2. STEM-elemental mapping revealed that Ni2P nanoparticles were successfully prepared and uniformly dispersed on CeO2.  The well dispersed Ni2P on CeO2 support resulted in smaller crystallite size and higher CO uptake.  The Ni2P/CeO2 exhibited the highest activity based on catalyst weight basis compared to the other supports, whereas Ni2P/TiO2-CeO2 (at Ti/Ce molar ratio of 0.98) afforded superior reactivity to Ni2P/CeO2 based on TOF (h-1). The TOF of anisole were in the descending order as follows: Ni2P/Ti0.98Ce0.02O2> Ni2P/TiO2 > Ni2P/CeO2 > bulk Ni2P.  The reaction pathways are preferred depending on the properties of supports that provide different product distributions. The relative electron enrichment on the Ni\u03b4+ site of Ni2P/CeO2 allowed benzene desorption from the catalyst surface after demethoxylation of anisole, whereas the lower electron density on Ni\u03b4+ of Ni2P/TiO2-CeO2 and the acidity of support promoted the deep hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane as a major product. The role of CeO2 in HDO reaction was investigated at different loading amounts of Ni2P.  In this work, Ni loading amount of 1.16 mmol/g exhibits the highest activity and selectivity to benzene.  The presence of phenol when Ni2P/Ti2O and Ni2P/TiO2-CeO2 were employed in anisole HDO could be correlated to the acidity of TiO2, which leads to methylation of anisole. Adding a small amount of ceria in TiO2 for Ni2P synergistic improved the TOF and suppressed phenol formation while increasing cyclohexane selectivity.  Both Ni2P/CeO2 and Ni2P/TiO2-CeO2 are promising catalysts in anisole HDO for the tunable target products of benzene and cyclohexane, respectively.  Ni2P/CeO2 catalyst exhibited high selectivity to benzene while Ni2P/TiO2-CeO2 provided the highest selectivity to cyclohexane.\nThe anisole adsorption on a support, forming an intermediate surface complex, could be a potential approach to enhance the accessible site for a chemical reaction to occur.  In situ FT-IR studies were conducted to obtain a better understanding of anisole adsorption at 300\u00b0C over supported Ni2P catalysts.  The result was evident that CeO2 and Ti0.98Ce0.02O2 provide the adsorption site for anchoring anisole molecules, resulting in a catalytic improvement in the anisole HDO of Ni2P.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14633], "author_name_tesi": "Pitakjakpipop, Pawnprapa ", "last_name_ssi": "Pitakjakpipop", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pawnprapa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Randy L.

Traditionally such services are financed primarily through tax-based allocations. Recently however, the public funding model for these services has become increasingly inadequate and inconsistent. Following a \u201cgolden era\u201d spanning the late 20th and early 21st centuries, support for local public parks and recreation fell dramatically. Overall funding for parks and recreation fell, funding decreased relative to other public services, and full-time jobs were lost at a hitherto unprecedented rate. As a result, alternative funding strategies have garnered increased attention as a potential method of retaining service quality and delivery. \n\nPrivatization, any activity that reduces the public\u2019s role in the financing and delivery of public services, is one such alternative strategy, and the focus of this dissertation. Although privatization may indeed mean selling public lands and facilities to the highest bidder, it is more likely to be a matter of degree. Individual practices such as corporate sponsorship, outsourcing, and increased reliance on volunteers are all examples of specific privatization practices. Just how \u201cpublic\u201d and how \u201cprivate\u201d any agency actually is may be a matter of debate, but implementing these practices is part of an incremental process moving an agency along a spectrum from fully public to fully private. Understanding constituent support for or opposition to these practices, as well as the factors that shape those attitudes, is of critical concern to practitioners who wish to explore privatization as a funding mechanism while maintaining public support and goodwill.\n\nChapter One serves as an introduction to the concept of privatization, as well as an overview of the current public funding situation. Chapter Five provides key findings, implications for practitioners within parks and recreation, and potential future research directions. The body of this dissertation consists of three individual studies, which comprise the second, third, and fourth chapters. \n\nThe first study (Chapter Two) provides an overview of attitudes towards privatization as a whole, towards individual privatization practices, and the factors that shape those attitudes. Attitudinal structure, as well as the level of ambivalence felt by respondents are also assessed. Within group differences are then presented, allowing for an understanding of how members of certain groups perceive the suite of privatization activities. \n\nStudy two (Chapter Three) consists of a contingent valuation analysis, which calculates the relative percentage of tax-funding respondents would allocate to parks and recreation and nine competitive local public services. The role of values and attitudes in explaining net allocations to parks and recreation is then explored using a model based on the cognitive hierarchy of human behavior. \n\nThe final study (Chapter Four) explores the role of values, ideology, and attitudes in shaping support for the implementation of privatization practices. A model based on the cognitive hierarchy of human behavior is presented and tested.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14831], "author_name_tesi": "Pitas, Nicholas A", "last_name_ssi": "Pitas", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation and Parks", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Mowen", "Andrew Mowen", "Alan Graefe", "B.

Typical examples of such processes range from reactive distillation in petroleum processing to plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, etching and metallorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) in semiconductor manufacturing. The key difficulty in designing control schemes for such PDE systems arises from the ``infinite-dimensional' nature of the distributed process model. Consequently, ideas for reducing the complexity of these models are considered through the formulation of the reduced order models (ROMs). A properly formulated ROM can replace the existing complex model thus greatly facilitating in the further design of control and optimization schemes for the above PDE processes.\n\nOne of the widely used methodologies for developing ROMs is the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Initially, one collects the experimental data or data from detailed numerical simulations (snapshots) in a ``dataset'. POD then extracts the characteristic basis (shape) functions from the collected data set. The computed basis functions are subsequently used in the framework of \"method of weighted residuals\" to compute the low-dimensional ROMs. The effectiveness of the POD methodology, however, is dependent on the quality of the collected dataset. Consequently, the ROMs are sufficiently accurate only in a restricted neighborhood around the state space where they are constructed. On the other hand, no well defined methodology exists for constructing ROMs with a larger region of validity as this requires a ``representative' dataset which contains all the possible spatial modes (including those that might appear during closed-loop evolution of the PDE system). Thus there arises a need for the development of efficient methodologies for the systematic update of these ROMs during the closed-loop process evolution.\n\n\nThus this doctoral thesis attempts to resolve fundamental computational issue associated with the formulation of the ROMs, specifically tailored for controller design, by developing a computationally efficient methodology called the adaptive proper orthogonal decomposition (APOD) that utilizes the closed-loop process information for ROM updates. The updated ROMs are utilized for synthesis of high-performance nonlinear & optimal feedback controllers using Lyapunov and geometric control techniques. The effect of the developed methodology on the closed-loop system is analyzed by a study of stability and other performance properties of the closed-loop system (distributed PDE process model along with the controller). The developed adaptive data-reduction methodology would also have applications in varies other fields such as efficient process monitoring and fault diagnosis of chemical processes.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6005], "author_name_tesi": "Pitchaiah, Sivakumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Pitchaiah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sivakumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou", "Antonios Armaou", "Ali Borhan", "Costas D Maranas", "Jacob Willem Langelaan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou, Dissertation Advisor", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member", "Jacob Willem Langelaan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nonlinear control", "Process control", "Proper orthogonal decomposition", "Partial differential equation", "Model reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Modulation of epileptiform activity by activation of tonic inhibition\n\n\n\n", "id": "8212", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The majority of the inhibition in the brain is mediated by GABA-A receptors. Synaptic GABA-A receptors enforce a strong, activity dependent inhibition, known as phasic inhibition. Extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors maintain a comparatively mild and continuous inhibition known as tonic inhibition. Previous work from the Chen laboratory has shown that chronic treatment with cyclothiazide (CTZ) induces epileptiform activity in mature rat hippocampal cultures, which is accompanied by a selective downregulation of extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors (Qi et al., 2006). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether downregulation of tonic inhibition mediated by extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors is causally linked to the formation and/or maintenance of epileptiform activity. A selective extrasynaptic GABA-A receptor agonist, THIP (Gaboxadol), was used at low concentration to study its effect on CTZ induced epileptiform activity. Chronic treatment of hippocampal cultures with CTZ induces epileptiform activity in about 80% of neurons. After simultaneous chronic treatment of cultures with CTZ and THIP, the percentage of neurons showing epileptiform activity was reduced to about 40%. Additionally, spontaneous epileptiform activity established in old hippocampal cultures was also studied and chronic treatment with THIP nearly abolished it. Acute THIP treatment reduced spontaneous epileptiform activity significantly. Besides reducing firing strength, chronic activation of tonic currents also reduces the frequency of synchronous network bursts, which may otherwise impede hippocampal learning. Our data suggests that tonic inhibition contributes towards maintenance of cellular epileptiform activity and drugs that activate it could be potential modulators of pathological hyperactive states like epilepsy as well.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [460], "author_name_tesi": "Pitre, Anar ", "last_name_ssi": "Pitre", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Andrew Ewing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Ewing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["epilepsy", "THIP", "tonic inhibition", "CTZ", "GABA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Brittle Damage Model in Thermoelastodynamics", "id": "9349", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The response of brittle materials subjected to dynamic thermomechanical loading \nis investigated.

Previous research has indicated that communication in general has been shown to facilitate sojourner adjustment abroad. However, to date, researchers have neither identified specific forms of communication that help students adjust, nor have they explored the specific function communication plays as a tool for adjustment abroad. One focus of this investigation, therefore, is on the patterns of communication established by a group of student sojourners as they adjusted to life abroad. In addition, previous studies have not tracked and explored subjective identity transitions across the sojourn. Thus, a second goal for this investigation was to systematically explore students\u2019 subjective identity transitions throughout the sojourn.  \n\nThis dissertation is the result of an ethnographic investigation conducted over the course of 13 months, 4 months in Paris, France and 9 months in the U.S. pre- and post-sojourn. The primary methods of data collection were narrative interviews, participant-observation, and participant journaling. This study offers a detailed description of the interconnections between sojourner stress, communication, and identity as students experienced them. Specifically, students used 9 types of talk across the sojourn to help them manage adjustment stress: Advice, superficial/introductory talk, information sharing, comparison, humor, story telling, gossip, complaint, and supportive talk. Using aspects of Burgoon\u2019s (1978) expectancy violations theory, I suggest that some student stress is the result of unmet expectations in four major areas: Academic/language expectations, social expectations, cultural/value expectations, and travel/cultural experience expectations. External sources of expectations came largely from their study abroad program, other students, friends/family at home, their host family, and their home university. Further, using Kim\u2019s (2001) integrative theory on communication and cross-cultural adaptation I suggest that the more adjustments students made through communication the more functionally fit they became across time. The result was positive identity transformations including a sense of being a \u201cglobal citizen\u201d and increased feelings of confidence and independence. Based on the reported findings, this study concludes with practical suggestions for future study abroad coordinators and directions for future research. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4160], "author_name_tesi": "Pitts, Margaret Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Pitts", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Michelle E Day", "Michael L Hecht", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Chair", "Michelle E Day, Committee Chair", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intercultural Communication", "Social Support", "Paris France", "Study Abroad", "Ethnography", "Cultural Adaptation"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "A MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING APPROACH FOR ROUTING AND SCHEDULING FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING CELLS", "id": "7230", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5105", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Scheduling of resources and tasks has been a key focus of manufacturing-related problems for many years.  With increased competition in the global marketplace, manufacturers are faced with reduced profit margins and the need to increase productivity.  One way to meet this need is to implement a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). \n\n\nA FMS is designed such that the efficiency of mass production is achieved while the flexibility of low-volume production is maintained.  One type of FMS is the flexible manufacturing cell (FMC), which consists of a group of CNC machines and one material handling device.  Scheduling is an important aspect in the overall control of the FMC.  This research focuses on production routing and scheduling of jobs within a FMC.  The major objective is to develop a methodology that minimizes the manufacturing makespan, which is the maximum completion time of all jobs.  \n\n\nDue to the complexity of the FMC routing and scheduling problem, a 0-1 mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for M-machines and N-jobs with alternative routings.  Although small instances of the problem can be solved optimally with a commercial optimization software package, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to solve medium-to-large-scale problems more efficiently.  This two-stage algorithm utilizes two heuristics to generate an initial feasible sequence and an initial makespan solution during the construction Stage I.  Then, during the improvement Stage II, the resulting initial solutions acquired from Stage I are combined with a Tabu Search meta-heuristic procedure.  Within the Tabu Search procedure, an efficient pairwise interchange (PI) method and a linear programming (LP) subproblem are used to acquire improved solutions.\n\n\nThe mathematical model and the proposed two-stage algorithm are demonstrated on several test problems for the makespan performance measure.  Although the proposed algorithm does not achieve optimal solutions for every instance, the computational test results show that the algorithm is very effective in solving small, medium, and large size FMC scheduling problems.  Overall, the proposed two-stage algorithm provides a tremendous savings in computational time compared to the exact MILP models and could be used in a true FMC environment with real-time scheduling situations.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5079], "author_name_tesi": "Pitts, Jr., Richard A", "last_name_ssi": "Pitts, Jr.", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura", "M Jeya Chandra", "Timothy William Simpson", "Irene Johnston Petrick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Irene Johnston Petrick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["flexible manufacturing cells", "mixed-integer linear programming", "tabu search meta-heuristic", "scheduling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Data Oriented Approach to Identify Lead Time Reduction Opportunities for a Complex Highly Engineered product Assembly", "id": "19913", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9473", "abstract_tesi": "This work focuses on overcoming and evaluating actual manufacturing challenges in mass customization processes. The production flow data oriented approach presented in this thesis identifies and supports lead time reduction efforts leading to on-time-delivery improvement for complex, highly engineered and customized product assemblies. \n\nThe need for building this data oriented approach arises from a significant growth in product demand for Subsea BOP Stacks and company focus on improving its on-time-delivery. Previous work that was completed earlier by research team members regarding the process of building a BOP Stack included the definition of a SIPOC for the main departments involved in this process, the development of BOP Stack information process flows for both pre-assembly and final assembly processes, and a cause-effect diagram that identified the general causes impacting delays and late deliveries of Stack Assemblies.\n\nThe current methodology includes: a) Final assembly process analysis based on information available in the company's information systems b) The definition of a standard final assembly sequence with standard operations and precedence constraints, c) The development and implementation of a delay tracking tool to identify major components causing critical delays during the final assembly of the BOP Stacks, and d) The implementation of a formal Engineering Change Request system at the final assembly department.\n\nAs a result of this work, a Downstream Project Management tool was created to link component delivery and assembly operations at the final assembly to operations in the upstream processes, and primary and secondary critical assembly paths and components were identified. Moreover, with the development and implementation of the Delay Log, it was possible to identify the major late components that were causing 80 \\% of the delays during final assembly and estimate the cost of these component delays.\n\n% In addition, the implementation of the formal Engineering Change Request system at the final assembly department is expected to minimize the response time of engineering for resolving change requests that cause final assembly delays.

The pathophysiology of dystonia remains poorly understood; however, recent evidence suggests that abnormal cerebellar signaling contributes to the expression of dystonia. To study the role of the cerebellum in dystonia, we first analyzed neurotransmission in the cerebellum of the genetically dystonic mouse, tottering.  A deficiency in excitatory but not inhibitory neurotransmission in tottering mice was seen after superfusion of cerebellar synaptosomes with 60mM KCl.  Further analysis of the role of cerebellar Purkinje cells in the generation of tottering dystonia was completed through breeding a transgene responsible for post-developmental Purkinje cell death onto the tottering mouse.  Prior to Purkinje cell degeneration, transgenic tottering mice exhibited classical tottering dystonic events; however, the same animals failed to exhibit dystonia after Purkinje cell loss had occurred in adulthood. The loss of the dystonic phenotype in double mutant mice indicates that Purkinje cells and the cerebellar cortex participate in the pathogenesis of dystonia in the tottering mouse.  These data support the theory that an abnormal signal from the cerebellar cortex of tottering mice is responsible for the dystonic phenotype.  To test this theory and examine the role of the cerebellum in dystonia, we developed a novel mouse model of dystonia.  Microinjection of low-doses of the glutamate analogue kainic acid into the cerebellum of wild type mice elicited reliable and reproducible dystonia.  Transgenic mice lacking Purkinje cells showed dramatically decreased dystonia after kainic acid injections, supporting the theory that aberrant cerebellar excitation is sufficient to produce dystonia. Together these data suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in the pathophysiology underlying dystonia.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [966], "author_name_tesi": "Pizoli, Carolyn Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Pizoli", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Carolyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ellen J Hess", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Robert G Levenson", "Teresa Wood", "James Robert Connor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ellen J Hess, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Chair", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Teresa Wood, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dystonia", "cerebellum", "tottering", "calcium channels", "kainic acid"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Innate and Adaptive Immunity to Bordetella pertussis and Francisella tularensis", "id": "26732", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11882", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Respiratory infections by bacteria are the cause of significant deaths throughout the world. By understanding how different bacteria interact with the innate and adaptive immune systems of the hosts they infect, we can gain insight in how to better treat, vaccinate, and prevent the diseases they cause. In this dissertation the focus will be on two different bacterial pathogens which are often focused on in terms of respiratory infection, Bordetella pertussis and Francisella tularensis.  Chapter 2 investigates the role of the inflammasome signaling complex and IL-1 signaling during interactions with B. pertussis and shows that the IL-1 response in the host, while required, does not require signaling through the inflammasome in the mouse model. In Chapter 3 we describe the development of a novel tool for studying CD8 T cell responses to F. tularensis LVS following vaccination by intranasal inhalation. Because Francisella can infect the respiratory tract as well as naturally infect through the intradermal route, which is the route by which humans are vaccinated, Chaper 4 reviews the currently limited immune responses generated locally within the skin. By understanding these various aspects of innate and adaptive immunity to each pathogen, we begin to develop and understanding of how both arms of the immune system interact to protect hosts during both primary and secondary challenges.

The focus of the study was the participant\u2019s perceptions of how this influence was experienced in regard to bachelor degree pursuit and attainment.  Of special interest was the examination of why these adult learners did not attend college as traditionally-aged students, what made them decide to attend currently, and how their attendance has been influenced by their family members.  Data primarily consisted of transcripts of in-depth one-on-one interviews with 13 participants who are currently attending, or who recently graduated from college, within the past year, were female and at least 25 years old, and who have a current family in addition to their family of origin.  Data were analyzed using manual thematic analysis.\n\tThe study findings are grouped into four categories.  First, issues associated with the family of origin negatively impacted college attendance for the vast majority of the participants.  Second, despite a general lack of support for higher educational attainment from their families, the majority of the participants dreamed of going to college.  Third, the current family significantly influenced the women\u2019s educational experiences primarily due to the integration of their daily lives with their current family members.  Last, the institution was found to in-directly influence the women\u2019s educational experiences as it related to her family because the structure of the programming made attendance possible.  The study ends with a discussion of the findings, implications for institutions who work with this student population, limitations of the study, ideas for future research, and some final reflections. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4914], "author_name_tesi": "Plageman, Paula M.", "last_name_ssi": "Plageman", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Paula", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Edward Taylor", "Edward W Taylor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Chiara Sabina", "Gina Brelsford"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Edward Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Chiara Sabina, Committee Member", "Gina Brelsford, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["influence", "family", "postsecondary education", "women", "adult", "persistence"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "TEST FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT FOR USE OF COAL COMBUSTION PRODUCTS (CCPS) IN EMBANKMENT CONSTRUCTION AND MINE LAND RECLAMATION\n", "id": "10996", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4728", "abstract_tesi": "Coal combustion products (CCPs) are by-products created when coal is burned for energy production. In 2007 alone, the United States produced in excess of 125 million tons of CCPs. Despite the fact that approximately 40% of the CCPs were used beneficially, 60% of the CCPs were disposed of via land filling. Reusing CCPs in large volume, civil engineering applications could greatly reduce and potentially outperform the natural materials currently required for these structures, which in many cases is more economical. Recycling CCPs also reduces the carbon footprint associated with mining naturally occurring material. However, CCPs are often perceived as strictly a waste product due to their chemical composition and potentially hazardous leachate even though not all CCPs should be considered environmentally unsound. In fact, their chemical composition can vary widely depending on the source power plant location, the power plant type, and the fuel source. Therefore it is necessary that CCPs be characterized both mechanically and chemically to qualify their utilization in civil engineering structures. The missing component in the current state of practice is a consistent methodology for categorizing CCPs as either environmentally and structurally sound or harmful when used as a construction material, and this methodology should be application-based. This paper describes the development of a detailed testing framework in order to qualify the use of CCPs in large-volume civil engineering applications, in particular embankments and mine land reclamation. The testing framework is then implemented for three types of CCPs with an analysis of results.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4693], "author_name_tesi": "Plaks, Nicholas ", "last_name_ssi": "Plaks", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angelica Palomino", "Angelica Palomino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angelica Palomino, Thesis Advisor", "Angelica Palomino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["unconfined compression test", "FGD material", "FBC ash", "bottom ash", "fly ash", "CCPs", "Coal combustion products", "hydraulic conductivity", "XRD", "effluent analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "SELF ASSEMBLED TWEEZER-TYPE METALLORECEPTORS FOR THE RECOGNITION OF NUCLEOTIDES\n", "id": "7308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2934", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two different classes of molecular tweezers are synthesized and evaluated.

The FGI was designed to incorporate assessment of both (a) factual questions about basic family demographics and nodal events using standardized genogram symbols (McGoldrick, et al., 1999), and (b) four dimensions of family emotional processes (i.e., marital conflict, emotional cutoff, symptoms in a spouse, & focus on a child), thought to be indicators of the systemic functioning in family systems (Bowen, 1978; Kerr & Bowen, 1988).  \nStage 1 of the current study involved creating and revising the FGI.  Items were written to create the FGI, and the subscale psychometrics were then evaluated. Based on reliability analyses at the item level, 4 FGI were removed for inadequate reliability. At the subscale level the FGI-Focus on a Child subscale was removed due to low internal consistency reliability.  Based on these analyses the final version of the FGI was established and used in subsequent analyses in Stage 2.  \nIn Stage 2 the inter-interviewer reliability of the participant scores in the FGI was determined to be on average at 95% agreement, indicating the FGI can be reliably administered across participants.  Construct validity assessment of the FGI subscale scores yielded mixed results, with two subscales, FGI-Marital Conflict and Symptoms in a Spouse, corresponding with existing measures of similar constructs.  However the third subscale, FGI-Emotional Cutoff, did not demonstrate a relationship to a similar existing measure as hypothesized.  Contrary to expectations, the FGI subscales also did not correspond with the Differentiation of Self Inventory (DSI).  However, there were also some informative, yet unpredicted results lending support for the construct validity of the FGI-EC subscale.  Consistent with Bowen Theory, the FGI-EC significantly correlated with the DSI-ER and MSI-FD subscales.  The mixed results indicate there appears to be some preliminary support for the construct validity of three remaining FGI subscales (i.e., Marital Conflict, Symptoms in a Spouse, and Emotional Cutoff.  The clearest limitation is that there was little evidence that emerged to support the notion that FGI subscales tap into systemic family emotional processes, which they were originally designed to assess. Using a cluster analysis, two groups were found to exist in the participant scores on the FGI.  The two groups differed on FGI-Marital Conflict and Emotional Cutoff scores, with one group having high FGI-Marital Conflict scores and low FGI-Emotional Cutoff scores and the other group displaying the opposite.  The groups did not differ on demographic characteristics or self reported levels of differentiation of self, suggesting that different patterns may exist among individuals at similar levels of differentiation. Limitations of this study and directions for future studies are discussed.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3736], "author_name_tesi": "Platt, Lisa Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Platt", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Skowron", "Robert B Slaney", "Jolynn Carney", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Skowron, Committee Chair", "Robert B Slaney, Committee Member", "Jolynn Carney, Committee Member", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["differentiation", "Bowen Family Systems Theory", "genogram"]}]
