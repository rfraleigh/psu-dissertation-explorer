This approach combines hydrogel-based microcontact printing and electroformation. This novel approach made it possible to address two main limitations of electroformation, controlling the size of the resulting vesicles and incorporating functional membrane proteins in the membranes of the giant vesicles. In addition, the use of hydrogel stamps enabled rapid production of multiple copies of a proteoliposome array with minute amounts of biomolecules. We demonstrated that the resultant liposomes had narrow size distribution (38.8 \u00b1 6.72 \u00b5m) and could be utilized as model membranes either attached to the surface in an array format or detached as free floating liposomes. We applied this platform to study water transport across lipid membrane through a water channel, aquaporin Z, and an artificial water channel, peptide-appended pillar[5]arene. Moreover, we demonstrated the applicability of these liposomes for screening lipid-protein interactions by studying the interactions between phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles and annexin-V.\n\nIn the second part, the thesis aimed to develop a nano-scale system that would enable targeting the \nmembranes of brain cancer cells and penetrating the blood brain barrier (BBB), for efficient delivery of a highly toxic metal chelator Di-2-pyridylketone-4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) to brain for the first time. To this end, we employed poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles prepared by nanoprecipitation method to efficiently encapsulate Dp44mT without affecting its antitumor activity. We evaluated the size and shape of the resultant nanoparticles using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and demonstrated that these particles were homogeneous in size and shape. These nanoparticles also exhibited good colloidal stability, with no detectable aggregation in physiological solutions over a week. Moreover, we were able to tune the drug release of Dp44m from the nanoparticles by either of adjusting PLGA composed of higher lactic acid ratio or reducing drug to PLGA polymer ratio. Next, we conjugated a targeting molecule, Interleukin-13 (IL13), to improve the uptake rate of the nanoparticles by brain cancer cells. The higher uptake rate by IL13-conjugation enhanced cytotoxicity in these cancer cells. In addition, the nanoparticles with IL13 conjugation showed a significantly improved transport across the BBB compared to unconjugated nanoparticles. More importantly, this formulation was not toxic to healthy endothelial cell lines, bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (BBMVECs), suggesting that this formulation could be a safe and effective strategy for selectively killing brain cancer cells.

We develop a framework for collectively and quantitatively interpreting information from multiple sources by utilizing both techniques prevailing in the social sciences and quantitative approaches. We then explore real healthcare applications by examining sequential information, which can be often observed in the healthcare area. Meanwhile, the decision-making process is as important as the analysis of information, and it tends to be complicated when there is only limited information under uncertainty. Therefore, we model a stochastic sequential decision making problem under such constraints and examine the structure of an optimal strategy in patient intervention in terms of cost-effectiveness.\n The main applications of this research lie in the areas of healthcare and prevention services. We consider three different applications. First, we apply the suggested framework to the analysis of multiple healthcare survey instruments that have been used for assessing the elderly with Delirium Superimposed on Dementia (DSD). Through our analysis, we validate the performance of a newly developed instrument that can assess a patient's DSD in a home care setting. As another healthcare application, we focus on Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a type of sleep disorder, and address the issue of adherence in using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment. Through various data mining approaches, we classify and cluster patients according to the pattern of their adherence to CPAP. We also explore stochastic behaviors in using CPAP and formulate Markov models and related decision making models using a Markov Decision Process (MDP), suggesting a guideline for cost-effective strategies to improve adherence. Prevention services, which aim to improve the mental health of youth, are studied as another healthcare application of this research. For this application, we prioritize a variety of prevention services by modeling a budget problem, and examine ways to improve the quality of implementation.  \nThe contributions of this research can be summarized as follows: first, to our knowledge, the framework for the analysis of information that we develop here is the first attempt to quantitatively measure the level of triangulation and complementation among multiple information sources. With the suggested framework, a researcher can infer the informational relationships underlying multiple information sources, thereby developing new insights for understanding and improving assessments used in the healthcare area. Second, the decision making models developed here can be applied to several types of intervention policy problem in which many uncertainties are involved.

It involves designing a system to withstand unavoidable variation while meeting its intended goal. Proposed and popularized by Japanese engineer and quality expert, Genichi Taguchi, it has entered the statistical mainstream and several approaches have been proposed. In the dual response RPD, response surfaces for the mean and the variance are obtained and depending on the goal of the experiment an objective function is determined. This is then optimized with respect to the control factors in order to find the best levels at which industrial processes should be carried out in order to obtain the best products. \n\nIn this dissertation, we propose a penalized likelihood approach to the dual response RPD which we call Adaptive Penalized Likelihood Effects Selection (APLES). We begin with a heteroscedastic linear model and specify a parametric variance function (specifically the log-linear variance function). We maximize the loglikelihood subject to constraints on the $L_1$ norms of the mean and variance parameter vectors in order to obtain simultaneous variable selection and estimation of the mean and variance parameters. For fixed values of the variance parameters, the problem reduces to a weighted least squares regression with an adaptive Lasso penalty. For fixed values of the mean parameters, the problem is equivalent to a gamma-error generalized linear model (GLM) with log link and an adaptive Lasso penalty. By iterating between these two minimization problems, we obtain the final set of APLES estimates for the non-zero mean and variance parameters. We describe and utilize the cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm which is very fast and has good convergence properties for the data sets that typically arise in applications.\n\nWe apply APLES to RPD and show using simulations that it has good performance in a wide variety of settings for the mean parameters, variance parameters, noise variables, and different choices of `quality' objective functions. We also illustrate the use of APLES by analyzing some well-known data sets from the literature. Another advantage of our approach is that it can be used for identification of location and dispersion effects in screening experiments. Screening experiments are the initial experiments carried out on a new process in which a potentially large number of factors are studied. Unlike RPD, the aim is not to optimize the subsequent response surfaces, but to select important variables for subsequent experimentation. We show that APLES performs equally well in these situations compared to other methods. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10370], "author_name_tesi": "Kankam, Kwame Adu", "last_name_ssi": "Kankam", "middle_name_ssi": "Adu", "first_name_ssi": "Kwame", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Landis Rosenberger", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Matthew Logan Reimherr", "Lingzhou Xue", "Enrique Del Castillo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Landis Rosenberger, Dissertation Advisor", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Chair", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Matthew Logan Reimherr, Committee Member", "Lingzhou Xue, Committee Member", "Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Penalized Likelihood", "Design of Experiments", "Coordinate Descent"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Method for Focusing Sound in Harbor Environments at Low Frequencies:  Theory and Experiment\n", "id": "8962", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "389", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new method to focus low frequency acoustic energy in harbor environments was developed as a means of deterring swimmers with malicious intent.

Broadly speaking, the research focuses\non developing gradient-based algorithms in networked and uncertain regimes and\nfocuses on the asymptotics and rate statements of such schemes. Next, we provide\na short description of each part of this dissertation.\n\nThe first part of this work considers computation of equilibria associated with\nNash games that lead to monotone variational inequalities, wherein each player\nsolves a convex program. Distributed extensions of standard approaches for solving\nsuch variational problems are characterized by two challenges: (1) Unless suitable\nassumptions (such as strong monotonicity) are imposed on the mapping arising in\nthe specification of the variational inequality, iterative methods often require the\nsolution to a sequence of regularized problems, a naturally two-timescale process\nthat is harder to implement in practice; (2) Additionally, algorithm parameters\nfor all players (such as steplengths, regularization parameters, etc.) have to be\nchosen centrally and communicated to all players; importantly, these parameters\ncannot be independently chosen by a player. Motivated by these shortcomings,\nwe present two practically implementable distributed regularization schemes that\nwork on a single-timescale; specifically, each scheme requires precisely one gradient\nor projection step at every iteration. Both schemes are characterized by the property\nthat the regularization/centering parameter are updated after every iteration,\nrather than when one has approximately solved the regularized problem. To aid\nin distributed settings requiring limited coordination across players, the schemes\nallow players to select their parameters independently and do not insist on central\nprescription of such parameters. We conclude with an application of these schemes\non a networked Cournot game with nonlinear prices.\n\nIn the second portion of our work, we consider stochastic variational inequalities\niii\nunder pseudomonotone settings. Referred to as pseudomonotone stochastic variational\ninequality problems or PSVIs, such problems emerge from product pricing,\nfractional optimization problems, and subclasses of economic equilibrium problems\narising in uncertain regimes. Succinctly, we make two sets of contributions to the\nstudy of PSVIs. In the first part of the paper, we observe that a direct application\nof standard existence/uniqueness theory requires a tractable expression for the\nintegrals arising from the expectation, a relative rarity when faced with general\ndistributions. Instead, we develop integration-free sufficiency conditions for the\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions to PSVIs. In the second part of the paper, we\nconsider the solution of PSVIs via stochastic approximation (SA) schemes, motivated\nby the observation that almost all of the prior SA schemes can accommodate\nmonotone SVIs. Under various forms of pseudomonotonicity, we prove that the\nsolution iterates produced by extragradient SA schemes converge to the solution\nset in an almost sure sense. This result is further extended to mirror-prox regimes\nand an analogous statement is also provided for monotone regimes, under a weaksharpness\nrequirement, where prior results have only shown convergence in terms of\nthe gap function through the use of averaging. Under strong pseudomonotonicity,\nwe derive the optimal initial steplength and show that the mean-squared error in\nthe solution iterates produced by the extragradient SA scheme converges at the\noptimal rate of O(1/K). Similar rates are derived for mirror-prox generalizations and\nmonotone SVIs under a weak-sharpness requirement. Finally, both the asymptotics\nand the empirical rates of the schemes are studied on a set of pseudomonotone and\nnon-monotone variational problems.\n\nThe third part of this dissertation studies networked settings where agents\nattempt to solve a common problem, whose information is both misspecified and\nonly partly known to every agent. We consider a convex optimization problem\nthat requires minimizing a sum of misspecified agent-specific expectation-valued\nconvex functions over the intersection of a collection of agent-specific convex sets,\ndenoted by X1, . . . ,Xm. The agent objectives are misspecified in a parametric sense\nand this misspecification may be resolved through solving a distinct stochastic\nconvex learning problem. We consider the simultaneous resolution of both problems\nthrough a joint set of schemes in which agents update their decisions and their\nbeliefs regarding the misspecified parameter at every step. The former combines\nan agent-specific averaging step and a projected stochastic gradient step while\nparameter updates are carried out through a projected stochastic gradient step.\nGiven such a set of coupled schemes, we provide both almost sure convergence\nstatements as well as convergence rate statements when either Xi = X for every i\nor when X is an intersection over Xi. Notably, we prove that when X is the intersection and agent objectives\nare strongly convex, we recover the optimal rate of stochastic approximation of\nO(1/K) in the solution iterates despite the presence of averaging (arising from\nthe consensus step) and learning (arising from misspecification). When strong\nconvexity assumptions are weakened to mere convexity but Xi = X for every i, we\nshow that the averaged sequence over the entire K iterations displays a modest\ndegradation in the convergence rate from the optimal rate in terms of function\nvalue. When the averaging window is reduced to K/2, we recover the optimal\nrate of convergence in function values.

The conventional processes use soluble alkali catalysts that contaminate the biodiesel and glycerol products, and present separation problems.  An efficient and clean process is crucial for large scale commercial production.  Solid catalysts have the potential to eliminate these problems.  \n\nA method has been developed to produce biodiesel using a solid catalyst.  The reaction is carried out at high temperature and pressure conditions (260 \u00b0C, 70 atm).  The high temperature is not a problem since the solid catalyst is part of a continuous process in which heat energy can be recovered.  The reaction time is short (15 minutes) compared to that of the conventional processes (~ 100 minutes).  \n\nPromising catalysts were identified from batch tests; and MnO was found to be the most effective catalyst from the lab-scale packed-bed reactor tests.  The reaction conditions allow for this mild solid base which can have a long life.  The conventional process conditions (60~70 \u00b0C, 70 atm) need specially prepared strong bases that lose their activity quickly.  The kinetics of the MnO-catalyzed reaction has been studied.  External mass transfer limited effects have been identified.  MnO was not the strongest of the bases tested, but it was the most effective. The reasons have been evaluated.  MnO has a long catalyst life (more than 500 hours).  Also, the amphoteric nature of MnO aids in the conversion of free fatty acids.

In order to aggressively scale the supply voltage (Vcc) for logic transistors, high mobility channel transistors (such as III-V based transistors) and steep sub-threshold slope transistors will be needed. It has already been demonstrated that ultra-high mobility compound semiconductor-based MOSFETs and quantum well FETs (QWFETs) (e.g. In0.7Ga0.3As and InSb) operate at low Vcc with high performance, InGaAs MOSHEMTs with InP composite barrier stack has been demonstrated with 3.5 times higher effective carrier velocity  than strained Si n-MOSFETs. \n     In this thesis, we first provide a literature survey regarding the origin of interface states at high-k dielectric/III-V semiconductor interface and the experimental methods of extracting interface state density (Dit) and we approximate the Dit profile and included in the simulation.

CBI was developed by Piotr Gal\u2019perin (1978a) furthered by Vladimir Davydov (1988b), and has been applied as a pedagogical approach to teaching based on the notion of conceptual mediation. Through systemic instruction, Chinese rhetorical norms will be examined from various perspectives, including culture, language, and different writing patterns. The study also applies another Vygotsky\u2019s educational application, Dynamic Assessment (DA), to evaluate participants\u2019 writing performance (Poehner, 2008). DA is a framework for conceptualizing teaching and assessment as an integrated activity which understands learners\u2019 potential abilities by actively supporting their development.\nThis study explored the effectiveness of an enrichment program that integrates CBI and DA. In particular, this study intended to examine the following: 1) any insights gained from the CBI intervention that explained the development of learners\u2019 conceptual understanding of Chinese rhetoric; 2) the possibility of tracking and promoting learners\u2019 abilities through DA; 3) the extent of interaction that promoted learners\u2019 development in a group DA context; 4) the usefulness of this enrichment program for future praxis in the field of SLA. Seven L2 Chinese learners at an intermediate to advanced level participated in this 6-week enrichment program in a study abroad context. The focus of the intervention was to guide participants to learn the concept of different Chinese writing patterns and how each pattern influences the organization, placement of thesis statement, and the presentation of ideas, supporting examples and descriptions in a Chinese text. Procedures of DA were provided throughout the sessions in the form of one-on-one mediation or group mediations. A microgenetic method was utilized to analyze dialogic mediation and interaction between the teacher/researcher and learners. The aim of the program was to mediate L2 Chinese learners\u2019 understanding of rhetoric styles, transforming their initial awareness into actual writing performances that reflect informed, intentional choices regarding their selection of particular rhetorical styles for a given composition. \nThe findings suggest that the integration of CBI and DA has a positive impact on learning Chinese rhetoric among L2 intermediate to advanced Chinese learners. The results from learners\u2019 materialization (i.e. learner-created SCOBAs, verbalization data, and writing products) show their conceptual development in its formation. The interactive data examined in DA reveals learners\u2019 abilities through ways of tracking and promoting learners\u2019 development over time. While establishing learner\u2019s autonomy and self-regulated learning, this enrichment program also renders classroom interaction more systematic and more attuned to learners\u2019 needs. Additionally, participants claimed positive effects of learning Chinese rhetoric through the CBI intervention and DA procedures, which provides useful insights for future implementation of CBI and DA in regular L2 classroom. It is therefore argued that the implications of this dissertation will inform not only theoretical research on the field of SLA but also pedagogical perspectives in classroom praxis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9981], "author_name_tesi": "Kao, Yu-ting ", "last_name_ssi": "Kao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu-ting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner", "Matthew Edward Poehner", "Karen E Johnson", "Elizabeth A Smolcic", "Xiaoye You"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Edward Poehner, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Elizabeth A Smolcic, Committee Member", "Xiaoye You, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sociocultural theory", "concept-based instruction", "dynamic assessment", "teaching Chinese as a foreign language", "Chinese rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MICROSTRUCTURE EVOLUTION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE METALLIC THIN-FILMS UNDER ION-BEAM IRRADIATION\n\n\n\n", "id": "7543", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1645", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The microstructural evolution of nanocrystalline metallic thin-films under ion irradiation, especially grain growth and second-phase precipitation, was studied with detailed  in situ experiments, and a theoretical model was developed to explain the results of grain-growth. Free-standing Zr, Pt, Cu and Au, Cu-Fe, and Zr-Fe nanocrystalline thin films prepared by sputter deposition were irradiated in-situ at the Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope (IVEM) at Argonne National Laboratory with Ar and Kr ions to fluences in excess of 10^16 ion/cm^2 at temperatures ranging from 20 to 773 K.\nThe microstructural evolution of the thin-films was followed in situ by systematically recording bright field images and diffraction patterns at successive ion-irradiation doses. Grain growth was observed as a result of irradiation in all samples at all irradiation temperatures. The results suggest the existence of three regimes with increasing irradiating temperature: a low temperature regime (below about 0.2 of the melting point) where grain-growth does not depend on the irradiation temperature, a thermally assisted regime where both the grain-growth rate and the final grain size increase with increasing irradiation temperature, and a thermal regime where thermal effects dominate ion beam effects. Similarly to thermal grain growth, the ion-irradiation induced grain growth curves could be best fitted with curves of the power type with the exponent being 3 in the low temperature regime. The effect of solute addition on grain-growth was investigated using Zr(Fe) and Cu(Fe) supersaturated solid-solutions. In the case of Zr-Fe, Zr2Fe precipitates formed during irradiation (with the dose-to-precipitation of Zr2Fe decreasing with increasing irradiation temperature), whereas Cu-Fe remained as a solid-solution. The grain-growth rate and final size decreased in both alloys with respect to the pure metallic films as a result of second-phase particle pinning (Zener drag) (Zr-Fe), and solute drag (Cu-Fe). The grain-growth rate was found to depend on material and on irradiation conditions. In particular, neither grain-growth nor precipitation occurred under 1 MeV electron irradiation. Combined with rate-theory calculations, this shows that long range diffusion does not play a role in the process. \n\tA model of grain-growth under ion irradiation in the temperature-independent regime was developed, based on direct impact of irradiation-induced thermal spikes on grain-boundaries. Grain-boundary migration occurs by atomic jumps within the thermal spike biased by the grain-boundary curvature driving force. The model incorporates cascade structure features such as subcascade formation, and the probability of subcascades occurring at grain-boundaries. This results in a power law expression relating the average grain-size with the ion dose, where the exponent is 3 in agreement with the experimental data. In the thermally assisted regime, the increased grain-growth is explained within the framework of the same model, by the increased thermal spike size with higher substrate temperature. At the highest temperatures, other effects such as subcascade overlap and point defect migration to sinks may also enhance the process.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1632], "author_name_tesi": "Kaoumi, Djamel ", "last_name_ssi": "Kaoumi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Djamel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Robert C Birtcher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Robert C Birtcher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanocrystalline metals", "in-situ TEM", "thin films", "irradiation induced phase tranformation", "grain growth", "ion beam irradiation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Effects of age on nicotine consumption and enzyme activity following methoxsalen administration in C57BL/6J male mice\n", "id": "11623", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "990", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With tobacco use and nicotine addiction reaching epidemic proportions worldwide, the race to find effective smoking cessation aids and methods for all populations of individuals is in full swing. There are several drugs on the market today specific for this purpose; however, many of these pharmacotherapies are not universally helpful, particularly for adolescents. Age, along with interindividual genetic polymorphisms in the enzyme responsible for nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6), may contribute to these disparities. Mimicking the genetic variants of this enzyme with known CYP2A6 inhibitors (e.g., methoxsalen) in adolescents and adults could provide crucial evidence for the role of these biological and genetic influences on cigarette consumption and nicotine dependence.\nThis dissertation is aimed to understand the effects of age on nicotine consumption and metabolism following acute and chronic methoxsalen administration in adolescent and adult male C57BL/6J mice. Experiment I was a 1-day study in which adolescent (n=60) and adult (n=60) male C57BL/6J mice received either no injection or a single subcutaneous injection of either physiological saline, vehicle (Emulphor, distilled water and ethyl alcohol) or one of two doses of methoxsalen (5 or 10 mg/kg), followed by access to a 3-bottle oral nicotine paradigm [tap water, 50 (LOW NIC) and 200 (HIGH NIC) ug/ml (-)-freebase nicotine dissolved in tap water] for 12 hours.\nTo further investigate the age differences in nicotine consumption and drug effects on serum cotinine (ng/ml/g), an 8-day two-phase study with adolescent (n=32) and adult (n=32) male C57BL/6J mice (Experiment II) was conducted. For the first four days (Phase I), animals received 24-hour unlimited access to the 3-bottle oral nicotine\niii\nparadigm (tap water, LOW NIC and HIGH NIC). During the four days of Phase II, animals continued to have access to the water and nicotine bottles, but were also given daily subcutaneous injections of either vehicle or 10 mg/kg 8MOP at the end of the light cycle. For Experiment I and II, nicotine exposure continued until sacrifice when livers were removed and trunk blood was collected to assess hepatic CYP2a5 and CYP2e1 gene expression and serum cotinine levels, respectively.\nIn Experiment I, adults consumed more nicotine (mL, mg/kg, % total fluid intake) than did adolescents, regardless of drug treatment. Results for Experiment II regarding nicotine consumption were not conclusive. For both studies, however, methoxsalen was found to be an age-dependent CYP2a5 inhibitor, such that serum cotinine levels (ng/ml/g) were reduced with increasing dosages of methoxsalen in adults, but not adolescents. Drug treatment and age did not alter relative gene expression levels for CYP2a5 or CYP2e1.\nResults of these two experiments provide significant contributions to the small pool of scientific literature regarding the effects of methoxsalen on nicotine consumption and pharmacokinetics in mouse models. Alternative methods for future studies that are indicated below are necessary to test explanations for the effects observed in this dissertation as well as to begin to understand what effect other biological determinants (e.g., sex) have on nicotine consumption and metabolism. Preclinical studies, such as Experiment I and II, are important stepping stones to answer the overarching question of whether or not smoking cessation aids can be tailored to the individual.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [980], "author_name_tesi": "Kapelewski, Christine Halina", "last_name_ssi": "Kapelewski", "middle_name_ssi": "Halina", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Klein", "Laura Klein", "Steven A Branstetter", "David John Vandenbergh", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Klein, Dissertation Advisor", "Laura Klein, Committee Chair", "Steven A Branstetter, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["methoxsalen", "mouse", "smoking cessation", "nicotine", "adolescent", "CYP2a5"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "I(MAGINING)-THOU AND IMAC: \nTHE (IM)POSSIBLE POSSIBLE\n\n", "id": "9007", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this autoethnographic study both personal and popular narratives are examined.

Lignin is also known to reduce digestibility of grasses (Van Soest, 1994), so it seems likely that the processes of lignification play an important role. Brachypodium distachyon is becoming more widely regarded as a new plant model for grasses and undergoes rapid growth and development, making it an attractive experimental system in which to characterize differences in lignin distribution before and after flowering. To date, limited studies of lignin have been published in this species. Here we use three natural Brachypodium accessions that vary in flowering time, Bd21-3, Bd1-1, and Adi-10, to investigate whether an increase in lignification is associated with flowering. Lignin in base internode sections was quantified by basic fuchsin fluorescence intensity and qualitatively assessed by phloroglucinol staining. Lignin in whole aerial plant biomass was quantified by acetyl bromide. Each ecotype was sampled for analysis at two week intervals for twelve weeks. We demonstrate the amenability of Brachypodium growth to rapid analysis of stem lignin throughout development. Based on phloroglucinol staining, lignification was found to increase spatially throughout development of each ecotype, initiating in the vasculature and spreading to interfascicular regions. This spread of lignification seemed to be somewhat correlated with the onset of senescence in Bd21-3 and Bd1-1 but not in Adi-10, where flowering occurred later. Our results from lignin quantification did not indicate any clear relationship between flowering and lignification in Brachypodium ecotypes and were largely confounded by variability in growth synchronicity in late flowering ecotypes. Basic fuchsin fluorescence quantification holds potential as a non-invasive method for quantifying lignin in stem cross sections, but is currently limited by the unidentified binding specificity of the dye. Furthering our understanding of how lignin is affected by the flowering transition will help inform conceptual and computational models of lignin\u2019s role in plant cell walls, and may shed light on how to improve digestibility of grass crops for forage and biofuels.

Due to the hazards associated with fault slip, much work has been done to understand the factors controlling deformation style within these zones, which can range from quiescent aseismic slip to devastating earthquakes, such as the 2011 Mw9 Tohoku Oki earthquake. In particular, our understanding of processes like slow earthquakes and healing within fault zones remains unclear. Additionally, as fault zones develop they become highly differentiated from their parent material, as fault materials mix, break, rotate, and develop into fabrics. These changes, which vary with fault composition, chemistry, stress, and strain, can cause significant strength changes and permeability decrease. In particular, fault permeability can dictate regional fluid flow and may allow faults to act as petroleum traps and seals. Despite the importance of such faults, our understanding of their permeability evolution, especially in marine-sediment basins, is relatively poor.\n\nIn this dissertation, I investigated the evolution of fault zones as they initiate and proceed through the seismic cycle. In particular, I studied the origins of slow earthquake slip, the mechanisms controlling deformation band formation, and the evolution of fault fabric and permeability with fault zone development. This work was predominantly conducted on laboratory fault zones in a biaxial forcing apparatus under conditions appropriate for fault development in Earth\u2019s upper crust. In chapter 1, I present the first laboratory observations of repetitive, slow stick-slip in fault zone materials (serpentine) and mechanical evidence for their origin. In particular, we document a transition from unstable to stable frictional behavior above a threshold velocity of ~10 \u03bcm/s. Additionally, these events are accompanied by precursory elastic wave speed reduction (2-21%) that begins up to 60 seconds before failure, perhaps suggesting a reliable earthquake predictor. In chapter 2, I investigate fault zone evolution through the seismic cycle and as it initiates, documented via elastic wave speed measurements. These experiments were conducted on halite under conditions where pressure-solution is operative, and they show the interplay of elastic wave speed measurements with porosity and fabric formation. Indeed, these observations point to a new technique for non-invasive fabric observation within laboratory and natural fault zones. In chapter 3 and chapter 4, I also discuss fault zone initiation and development for two specific cases: deformation bands and clay-rich marine-sediment faults. \n\nChapter 3 highlights deformation band formation through laboratory experiments, and shows that fault strengthening via shear-driven comminution is the likely mechanism limiting strain. I observe significant strengthening at low shear strains (e.g., \u03b3 < 5), and tie these observations directly to particle-size reduction. To accommodate fault-like strain, many deformation bands form within a given region, significantly limiting fluid flow, similar to standard faults. In chapter 4, I discuss the permeability evolution of faults under conditions appropriate for marine-sediment basins, like the Gulf of Mexico. In particular, the role of halite and clay within faults adjacent to salt domes and the possibility for multimechanism behavior, including brittle deformation at high strain rates and ductile deformation and pressure solution at slower rates is unclear. We found that that fault permeability can be reduced by up to 2-4 orders of magnitude with clay content, that small load (\u03c3n < 6 MPa) and small strain (\u03b3 < 5) can cause < 1 and < 2 orders of magnitude permeability reduction, respectively, and that halite is largely interchangeable with quartz for permeability.\n\nThis dissertation provides mechanical insight on a variety of fault deformation styles, as well as their implications. I document the first observations of slow earthquakes in the laboratory, evidence for their origins, and evidence for viable premonitory earthquake signals. I characterize fault fabric evolution leading up to and through the seismic cycle, and suggest a new tool for these observations. I provide significant evidence for the mechanism controlling deformation band formation and arrest. And I show how permeability may evolve within marine-sediment basin faults. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8748], "author_name_tesi": "Kaproth, Bryan Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Kaproth", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Marone", "Demian Saffer", "Eliza Richardson Marone", "Derek Elsworth", "Charles James Ammon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Marone, Dissertation Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member", "Eliza Richardson Marone, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fault mechanics", "Slow slip", "Permeability", "Fault strength", "Fault fabric", "Active seismic"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FINGER INTERACTION IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL PRESSING TASK: \nCONTROL OF FORCE MAGNITUDE AND DIRECTION AND AGE RELATED DIFFERENCES\n\n", "id": "10729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5834", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses the indices of finger interaction in single- and multi-finger pressing tasks in different directions and the effects of aging on these interactions. Accurate control of forces produced by the fingers is essential for performing object manipulation. The first study presented in this thesis examines the indices of finger interaction when accurate time profiles of force are produced in different directions, while using one of the fingers or all four fingers of the hand. We hypothesized that patterns of unintended force production among shear force components may involve features not observed in the earlier studies of vertical force production. In particular, we expected to see unintended forces generated by non-task fingers not in the direction on the instructed force but in the opposite direction, as well as substantial force production in directions orthogonal to the instructed direction. We also tested a hypothesis that multi-finger synergies, quantified using the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, will help reduce across-trials variance of both total force magnitude and direction. Young, healthy subjects were required to produce accurate ramps of force in five different directions by pressing on force sensors with the fingers of the right (dominant) hand. The index finger induced the smallest unintended forces in non-task fingers. The little finger showed the smallest unintended forces when it was a non-task finger. Task fingers showed substantial force production in directions orthogonal to the intended force direction. During four-finger tasks, individual force vectors typically pointed off the task direction, with these deviations nearly perfectly matched to produce a resultant force in the task direction. Multi-finger synergy indices reflected strong co-variation in the space of finger modes (commands to fingers) that reduced variability of the total force magnitude and direction across trials. The synergy indices increased in magnitude over the first 30% of the trial time and then stayed at a nearly constant level. The synergy index for stabilization of total force magnitude was higher for shear force components as compared to the downward pressing force component. The results suggest complex interactions between enslaving and synergic force adjustments, possibly reflecting the experience with everyday prehensile tasks. For the first time, the data document multi-finger synergies stabilizing both shear force magnitude and force vector direction. These synergies may play a major role in stabilizing the hand action during object manipulation. \n            In the second study done on elderly participants, we looked at how the indices of finger interaction change with aging. We hypothesized that elderly participants will show lower enslaving not only for normal forces but also for shear forces. We expected the elderly to be less accurate in both force magnitude and direction. We expected the higher motor variability in the elderly to be associated with lower indices of synergies stabilizing those variables. These hypotheses have been confirmed. In addition, we found that, compared to younger participants, the elderly participants produced larger forces in directions orthogonal to the instructed force direction. This finding contrasts the lower indices of unintended force production by non-instructed fingers in the elderly. The time profiles of the synergy indices computed for both force magnitude and direction were similar across the younger and elderly groups: Both showed stronger synergies later in the trial. Quantitatively, however, these indices were significantly smaller in the elderly participants. This study has shown that aging is associated not only with lower voluntary force magnitude and lower accuracy of force production but also with changes in finger interaction. There is a tendency towards preference for individual finger involvement (lower indices of enslaving) accompanied by worse synergic control of fingers in multi-finger tasks. However, the control of individual finger force direction is impaired in the elderly as demonstrated by the increased index of finger force production orthogonal to the instructed direction. These findings may have implications for exercises to prevent the deterioration of the hand function with age and for rehabilitation of the hand function. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5831], "author_name_tesi": "Kapur, Shweta ", "last_name_ssi": "Kapur", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shweta", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Mark Latash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Latash, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["finger interaction", "aging", "synergy", "enslaving", "hand", "Motor Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "simulations of the flow generated by fluidic inserts for supersonic jet noise reduction based on steady RANS simulations", "id": "25662", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11259", "abstract_tesi": "The investigation of military jet noise prediction and reduction is an ongoing activity.  Supersonic military jets radiate higher noise levels than commercial aircraft and are not subject to noise requirements.  The noise generating mechanisms for high-speed jets are not entirely understood, making it difficult to set strict noise standards similar to those imposed for commercial aircraft.  However, many noise reduction techniques have been applied to attempt to alleviate environmental and health concerns.  Little success has been achieved to date for noise reduction of exhaust jets on supersonic tactical aircraft.\n\t\n\tA newly developed method involves a system that generates fluidic inserts in a supersonic nozzle flow to produce noise reduction.  Numerical simulations have been performed for a military-style basline nozzle and with the noise reduction method of fluidic inserts used at a design Mach number of 1.65 and at various off design conditions.  The purpose of the current numerical study is to provide insight for the flow field generated by the fluidic inserts used to reduce supersonic jet noise.    \n\t\n\tThe supersonic jet simulations are based on the use of high fidelity meshes combined with advanced CFD technology.  Steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are used to predict the flow field.  Noise measurements have been performed experimentally and the results from the numerical simulations provide a correlation between aerodynamic properties and the corresponding noise reduction.  The complex nozzle geometry is modeled using both an unstructured mesh and a multiblock structured mesh.  The grids are generated by ANSYS ICEM and Gridgen respectively.  The numerical simulations are performed using ANSYS CFX and Wind-US.  The simulations with Wind-US use the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model, while the simulations with ANSYS CFX use the Menter SST turbulence model.  The results from the two flow solvers are compared and provide good agreement. \n\t\n\tThe objective is to simulate a military-style nozzle, which resembles engines of the GE F404 family, with fluidic inserts.  The purpose of the fluidic inserts is to alter the flow field similar to that of a hard wall corrugation in order to reduce components of noise radiation.  The addition of the fluidic inserts increases the complexity of the flow field for the supersonic jet.

Using modeling and experiments, I show that fluid flows and particle migration can occur over a distance of merely 1 millimeter phenomenon.

It is an auto-electrokinetic mode of transport and fluid flow involving no external electric field in the system. Such flows are shown to occur even in dead-end capillaries which are inaccessible to any other form of fluid flow mechanism. \nParticle transport through diffusive processes have been studied before in relation with reaction-diffusion in biology and chemistry, Brownian ratchet processes, dispersion in microfluidics and even salt-fingering in ocean mixing. However, by establishment or self-generation of salt gradients, particle migration is shown to be boosted significantly. The novelty in my work comes in through experiments via various ion-gradient generation mechanisms which show that diffusiophoresis can generate flows in capillaries with a dead-end where pressure-driven flows seize to operate. In this work, I show that the essential physics of diffusion-induced fluid flow could be used to generate pumping from calcium carbonate micropumps in microporous geologic systems, which could be further used for extraction of oil plugs entrapped inside dead-end pores of reservoir rocks.

In many cases one would gain great advantage to be able to design transport in these dead-end pores. However, achieving fluid flows in dead-end pores is not possible through conventional pressure-driven mechanisms. Traditional electrokinetic flows produced by inserting electrodes are also impractical, especially when these pores are located in difficult-to-reach regions. In this thesis we explore whether a subtle but important fluid flow mechanism, called diffusioosmosis, can produce \u201cchemically-driven flows\u201d in dead-end pores, causing transport and exchange of materials. This phenomenon of \u201ctransient diffusioosmosis\u201d utilizes the presence of a spatiotemporal ionic gradient across dead-end pores to generate an in situ electric field which drives convection along the charged walls of the pores. Unlike pressure-driven flow mechanisms where the wall acts as a \u201cresistance\u201d, in diffusioosmotic flows the wall acts as a \u201cpump\u201d with the salt gradient acting as a \u201clocalized battery\u201d generating motion.\n\tFollowing a summary of the relevant literature on diffusioosmosis and diffusiophoresis (which refers to particle transport coupled with fluid flow), a brief overview of its applicability in geological settings is provided. Surprisingly, we find strong cues of such flows occurring from sudden tectonic movements on earth\u2019s crust as well as during reactive transport phenomena involving dissolution-reprecipitation across rock-fluid interfaces. To illustrate this simple yet important concept, three major scientific questions have been explored:\n1)\tWhat are the flow rates due to ionic gradients inside dead-end pores, and how far do they extend? Subsequently, how can the transport of mobile species be controlled based on the variation in zeta potentials and other physical parameters?\n2)\tWhat is the rate at which colloidal fouling can be enhanced or mitigated on membrane surfaces through application of ionic gradients?\n3)\tIn pseudomorphic mineral replacement reactions, how do convective flows generated from ionic gradients affect the reaction rate of the system? Consequently, how do these flows enable us to distinguish between reaction and transport limitations along with the quantitative predictions for rate of release of trapped resources from mineral entities?\nRemarkably, colloidal migration generated from such chemical energy are found to be orders of magnitude faster than diffusion time scales and are likely to be critical in various technological operations like hydraulic fracking and waste water purification.\nThe two key results discussed in this thesis are: (a) Electrokinetic flows, e.g. diffusioosmosis, generated from mineral dissolution is a novel way of interpreting mass transfer with the external surrounding, and (b) these flows can drive convective particle migration where other forms of fluid flow are difficult to be set up. \n\tThis work constitutes a significant advancement in the field of auto-electrokinetic transport, i.e. diffusiophoresis, and signifies its importance in several physical and geological settings.

NTFPs constitute a safety net for forest-adjacent people, who, having collected NTFPs for centuries, depend on them for subsistence and cash income. Bangladesh\u2019s Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) is a case in point, as its indigenous peoples survive in precisely this way. Given this dependence, establishing better approaches to NTFP management for rural development and conservation has become a vital issue. There is great concern, too, that initiatives to commercialize NTFPs be designed so as not to encourage even more overharvesting than is currently taking place. \nThis research takes its place in this conversation about conserving natural resources and improving local people\u2019s livelihoods. Its purpose is threefold: to establish site-specific NTFP\u2013livelihood linkages and to investigate the problems and potential of using NTFPs to sustain and improve livelihoods, and on this basis to conceptualize initiatives for supporting sustainability and higher incomes for local people in the long term. As there is little research on Bangladesh\u2019s use of NTFPs, this study\u2019s central research question is both fundamental and far-reaching in nature: How could NTFPs be better utilized to improve the livelihoods of forest-adjacent communities and to achieve the goal of conserving forest resources? \nThis study has been conceptualized through a research framework focused on sustainable livelihoods to achieve the research goals of improving forest-adjacent peoples\u2019 livelihoods and conserving forest resources. Instrumental to pursuing the research question was a mixed method that involved both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including the participatory rural appraisal tools of structured questionnaire interviews targeting households and NTFP-market stakeholders, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. An entire year of numeric and qualitative field data was collected, and statistical methods along with NTFP production-to-consumption system (PCS) analysis were used to compile and analyze the data.\nThe study\u2019s results confirmed that forest-adjacent communities depend on diverse types of NTFPs for their livelihoods, and that the poor are more dependent than are the rich. Analysis showed that the households\u2019 average NTFP-related income is much higher than their timber income, as the forest areas though much degraded still yield some NTFPs. A regression model showed that a household\u2019s NTFP income could be estimated from how many members it has and the value of its implements and furniture. Noteworthy, too, is that females collect most of the NTFPs for their households and that most of the time the households spend collecting NTFPs is dedicated to those that provide food, which, therefore, warrant special attention for subsistence-oriented NTFP promotion and conservation. Various factors constrain NTFP markets, among which are insufficient transport facilities, lack of financial capital, and shortage of market information in the absence of any market information system (MIS). The villagers\u2019 market knowledge of most NTFPs is limited, in large part due to various socioeconomic factors. NTFP domestication initiatives are few and organizational efforts to develop NTFP-based entrepreneurship are almost nonexistent; yet, most of the villagers expressed interest in such interventions, seeing in them a ways to improve earnings. The results also established that NTFPs of CHT are being overharvested and that, even at its current level, NTFP commercialization is accelerating resource depletion mainly because of undefined land and property rights, financial crises experienced by the villagers, and overpopulation. Moreover, analysis of five NTFP market chains showed that the NTFP-market stakeholders\u2019 vertical linkages are stronger than the horizontal linkages, and there is little NTFP cultivation or investment. NTFP stakeholders\u2019 average NTFP incomes show great disparities that are not proportional to differences in time, labor, and capital invested. Overall, the research findings indicated that there is a wide margin for improving NTFP management in order to meet development and conservation objectives. Some key interventions include defining land and property rights, making NTFP-specific plans, effectively enforcing rules, developing NTFP entrepreneurship with domestication support, establishing a MIS, and having a people-oriented forest-management approach.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5732], "author_name_tesi": "Kar, Shiba P.", "last_name_ssi": "Kar", "middle_name_ssi": "P.", "first_name_ssi": "Shiba", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Gregory Jacobson", "Michael Gregory Jacobson", "Marc Eric Mcdill", "Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Gregory Jacobson, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Gregory Jacobson, Committee Chair", "Marc Eric Mcdill, Committee Member", "Wayne Lawrence Myers, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Non-timber forest products", "NTFP", "forest conservation", "livelihood development", "Bangladesh", "Chittagong Hill Tracts"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF DUCTED FAN FLOWS USING AN IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD", "id": "8828", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3683", "abstract_tesi": "The Cartesian immersed boundary code \u201cCARIBOU\u201d has been used for several validation cases and to compute the flow field for a rotating blade and a ducted fan.

Nevertheless, collected data show that the lift force, for the early stages of flow development, oscillates about the average lift curve, which is also predicted theoretically. \nFor the ducted fan study the fan is represented by a classical pressure jump. Three duct geometries are analyzed with the 2D serial version of the CARIBOU code. The flow computations, for all three ducts, show wake expansion at the exit of the duct, which agrees well with theory. However, the flow analyses show that duct geometry influences the wake development downstream.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3663], "author_name_tesi": "Karachun, Kateryna ", "last_name_ssi": "Karachun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kateryna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immersed boundary method", "CARIBOU"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Examining Stressors, Coping Mechanisms Of Stress\nand Negative Outcomes Of Stress\nin Istanbul Police Department", "id": "22350", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10010", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Policing literature indicates that occupational police stress can lead to negative outcomes in police practices and the in private lives of police officers.

This process also increases the energy density and bulk density of biomass; thus addressing the bulkiness issue. Many studies have been conducted to determine optimum conditions for pelletizing. However, no relationship between the mechanical properties of ground biomass on the pellet quality is published in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop and verify a predictive relationship between mechanical properties of the ground biomass and the quality metrics of pellets. Development of such a relationship will reduce the operational difficulties of densification process and will provide the framework for addressing better the issues such as quality control during pelletization.\nTo accomplish the goal, three selected biomass found in abundance in the Northeast U.S., namely, corn stover, switchgrass, and willow, were ground with two different screen sizes; 3.175 mm, and 6.35 mm and were conditioned at two different levels of moisture content; 17.5%, and 20% (w.b.). Hydrostatic triaxial compression (HTC) tests were performed using the Cubical Triaxial Tester (CTT) to determine the various mechanical properties, namely bulk modulus, compression index, and spring back index. They were determined using the HTC test at unloading pressures of 20, 45, 70, and 95 kPa. Pellets were formed by ground biomass using a lab-scale pellet mill. The physical properties such as diametral tensile strength, axial compressive strength, pellet density, and durability were determined.\nBased on the determined D50 values for all three biomass materials, the size-reduced biomass with 6.35 mm screen size is higher by 30-40% than reduced with 3.175 mm screen size. For ground corn stover, the value of bulk modulus initially decreases slightly at 45 kPa and then increases till 95 kPa, whereas the value of bulk modulus of smaller screen size increases with increasing pressure. The bulk modulus values of switchgrass and willow increases with increase in the isotropic pressure for all four conditions. Compression index increases with pressure for all three materials. Spring-back index values decrease with the increase in the isotropic pressure, however, the values slightly increase at high pressure, in some cases.\nPellet durability for all three materials is more than 80%. The pelletization process compresses the loose material nearly 12-14 folds for corn stover, 7-9 folds for switchgrass and 5-7 folds for willow, respectively. The achieved relative pellet densities are 96%-98% for corn stover, 67%-88% for switchgrass, and 91%-98% for willow, respectively. Diametral tensile strength is 4-5.8 MPa for corn stover, 0.9-3.8 MPa for switchgrass and 0.8-5.7 MPa for willow pellets, respectively. Axial compressive strength is 8-11.5 MPa for corn stover, 0.8-5.7 MPa for switchgrass and 1.5-8.5 MPa for willow pellets, respectively.\nCorrelation coefficients are calculated to evaluate the relationships and their level of significance after the determination of the physical and mechanical properties of ground biomass and pellets. The regression equations between pellet quality and mechanical property having R2 value higher than 90% are selected for prediction. For switchgrass, spring-back index and compression index are found to be most suitable for predicting diametral tensile strength, and axial compressive strength, whereas, for willow, compression index is found to be most suitable for predicting diametral tensile strength, and axial compressive strength, respectively. For the validation of the developed relationships, switchgrass and willow ground with 6.35 mm screen size is conditioned at 18.75% w.b. to form pellets. The percent difference between the measured and predicted values for switchgrass and willow wood for axial compression strength and diametral compression strength are from 5.79% to 11.54%; well within the mean percent spread of 71% for the measured values. Based on the validation, it can be concluded that the strength quality metrics of switchgrass and willow pellets can be predicted using size reduced materials\u2019 compression index and spring-back index, and compression index, respectively.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9152], "author_name_tesi": "Karamchandani, Apoorva ", "last_name_ssi": "Karamchandani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Apoorva", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Ho Jae Yi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Thesis Advisor", "Ho Jae Yi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Densification", "Pellet quality", "Hydrostatic triaxial compression", "Physical properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Microscale Mechanical Characterization for Macroscale Quality Assessment of Densified Biomass Assemblies", "id": "14688axk1005", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14688", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The quantitative contribution of inter-particle binding mechanisms at the microscale is essential knowledge to engineering the biomass densification. The goal of the presented research was to characterize the mechanical behavior of densified biomass assemblies at the microscale and assess their macroscale quality based on the microscale properties. The objectives aimed to quantify the mechanical properties of particle-particle binding, to characterize the arrangement of particles in a densified assembly, and to develop a relationship between microscale mechanical characteristics and macroscale mechanical biomass assembly properties. Switchgrass was size reduced using one screen size of 3.175 mm and conditioned to have the moisture content of 17.5% (w.b.) for microscale and macroscale mechanical characterizations.\nFirst step towards microcharacterization of particle-particle bond was to determine the stress-strain response of single particle. Single switchgrass particle in dry and wet states were tested using an adapted microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device in conjunction with the imaging techniques. Dry particles exhibited monotonic linear elastic response whereas wet particles exhibited three-phase sigmoidal shaped stress-strain response. The three phases include the first linear elastic zone up to approximately 1.6% strain, the second linear elastic zone up to strain ranging from 1.6 to 2.1% with significantly increased elastic modulus (168.9-223.7%), and the third linear elastic zone beyond 2.1% strain, where elastic modulus declined sharply (down to 90.9% of the second phase). The modulus of elasticity up to 1.5% strain for dry and wet switchgrass particles were 1.60 \u00b1 0.33 GPa and 6.99 \u00b1 1.66 GPa, which were significantly different each other (p < 0.001). Increase in the stiffness of switchgrass particles contributed to the bundling of fibers promoted by the activation of binders due to the increased moisture content.\nThis study further investigated the influence of pressure and temperature on the stiffness of the particle-particle binding formed by the activation of natural binders present in the switchgrass. Bound two-particles were extracted from densified assemblies that were formed using a single action die system at predetermined pressures and temperatures including Treatments A (60 MPa and 75\u00b0C), B (100 MPa at 75\u00b0C), C (60 MPa and 90\u00b0C), and D (100 MPa at 90\u00b0C). For these four treatments, the particle-particle binding stiffness values were 0.955 \u00b1 0.368 kN m-1, 0.986 \u00b1 0.266 kN m-1, 0.550 \u00b1 0.248 kN m-1, and 0.703 \u00b1 0.249 kN m-1, respectively. The diametral tensile strength of formed assemblies at treatments A, B, C, and D were 38.1 \u00b1 2.3 kPa, 60.9 \u00b1 7.1 kPa, 7.2 \u00b1 1.4 kPa, and 16.4 \u00b1 6.4 kPa, respectively. The density of formed assemblies at treatments A, B, C, and D were, 619.5 \u00b1 25.4 kg m-3, 655.7 \u00b1 55.7 kg m-3, 421.7 \u00b1 52.5 kg m-3, and 472.5 \u00b1 19.5 kg m-3, respectively. Diametral tensile strength and density of assemblies were linearly correlated to the stiffness of particle-particle bonds (R2=0.838 and R2=0.981). High pressures were documented to form stronger compacts, however, presence of sufficient moisture at low temperature significantly improved the densified assembly properties by assumed lowered the glass transition temperature of lignin to form stronger bonds.\nFurther investigation was performed on the coordination number and associated contact area to investigate a minimum requirement for a stable assembly. Particle arrangements of densified switchgrass assemblies formed at treatments A, B, C, and D were investigated by MicroCT scan images. The range of coordination number ranged from 9 to 12 for Treatment A, 12 to 14 for Treatment B, 6 to 7 for Treatment C, and 8 to 10 for Treatment D, respectively. Since biomass particles are highly irregular in shape, percentage contact area provides additional information on green compacts\u2019 evolving integrity. The percentage of contact area for switchgrass compacts formed at treatments A, B, C, and D were 58.3\u00b18.8, 81.7\u00b14.5, 36.2\u00b14.2, and 40.3\u00b12.1, respectively. Coordination number and percentage contact area of all specimen were found to be positively correlated each other (R\u00b2 = 0.872). In addition, strong correlations between microscale properties, i.e., coordination number and associated percentage area, and macroscale properties, i.e. densities and strength of assemblies, were also found (R\u00b2 >0.85). \nIn summary, the combination of moisture, temperature, and pressure can form a stable biomass assembly through both chemical and mechanical changes. Moisture loss at higher temperature can adversely affect the binding strength of particles, resulting in weaker interactions in the assembly. Additionally, this study found the importance of pressure that can induce particles to break into smaller sizes with changed shape, to undergo rearrangement, and therefore, to attain a stable structure with better mechanical interlocking between particles. This study contributes to science and engineering of biomass densification by providing an insight into the formation of a stable biomass assembly with preferred attributes of the very building block, i.e. particles.

Now everyday objects are being connected to the Internet from thermostats to CCTV cameras, from refrigerators to watches. The type and volume of data flowing in and out of the devices are at an unprecedented level. While the industries are focusing on connecting everything to the Internet without focusing on security, IoT related cyber-attacks have touched record heights. One of the challenges when dealing with security of the Internet of Things is that there is no standardization of protocols or platforms to be used. New protocols and platforms are being developed now and then. There is a lack of understanding of how these platform work. Apple\u2019s HomeKit and Google\u2019s Android Things are two of the most promising IoT platforms. In the first half of this thesis, we look at the security challenges of IoT and try to explain how Apple\u2019s HomeKit and Google\u2019s Android Things works along with the security features built in them.\nMost of the security problems are usually attributed to the incorrect implementation of different protocols. IoT devices rely on different protocols to talk with each other. Thus, it becomes very important for IoT devices to test the implementation of that protocol rigorously. Protocol fuzzers are one of the most widely used tools for testing the implementation. But the problem with the current protocol fuzzers is that usually, they are not optimal, inefficient, time-consuming and do not cover all the possible inputs. In the second half of this thesis, we propose an efficient model for an IoT protocol fuzzer. We harness the power of state machine and packet representation to not blindly mutate the data input, but we mutate the states in the state machine. We mutate based on context, timings, feedback/fitness, probability code coverage along with standard mutation operator.

Our studies examine aspects of the host immune response that are required for efficient immunity against B. pertussis as well as B. bronchiseptica, which is a respiratory pathogen of primarily non-human mammals. Itk, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is part of the T cell receptor signaling pathway, is required for the efficient clearance of B. pertussis from the lungs of mice but is not important for the clearance of B. parapertussis, despite these pathogens being closely related. This finding led us to investigate the B. pertussis-specific factor that may be involved in this observation. We determined that Itk is required to overcome the effects of the virulence factor Pertussis Toxin, which is not expressed by B. parapertussis. Also, we discovered a novel role for Itk in leukocyte recruitment to the lungs for the efficient antibody-mediated clearance of B. pertussis. Furthermore, we identified a critical role of the Interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) in overcoming the effects of the B. bronchiseptica Type VI Secretion System in vivo, since IL-1R-/- mice succumbed to lethal infection in the presence of this newly discovered virulence factor. Furthermore, we address the mechanism by which B. parapertussis evades immunity to facilitate persistance within the respiratory tract. This pathogen induces IL-10 production during infection to limit the pro-inflammatory IFN-\u03b3 responses that promote bacterial clearance. \n\tAdditionally, we present a study of the effects of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination on immunity against B. parapertussis. Here, we identified a single vaccine antigen, Pertactin, which was able to enhance B. parapertussis colonization in the lungs of aP-vaccinated mice. Notably, we determined that aP-vaccination in mice enhanced bacterial shedding, which may have important implications regarding the transmission of B. parapertussis within heavily vaccine-immune human populations. Lastly, we present a study characterizing the newly emerging human pathogen B. holmesii. While this species has been isolated from humans with whooping cough-like symptoms, it is unable to efficiently colonize mice via a mechanism that appears to involve impaired adherence to the murine epithelium. B. holmesii more efficiently adhered to human epithelial cells, which may indicate that this pathogen is host-restricted to humans. Finally, the implications and significance this research, as well as future directions to be further investigated are discussed. Together, these studies examine the interactions between the bordetellae virulence factors and host immune responses to provide a better understanding of the complex host-pathogen interactions that lead to efficient colonization and clearance of the bacteria from the respiratory tract.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7584], "author_name_tesi": "Karanikas, Alexia Theofanie", "last_name_ssi": "Karanikas", "middle_name_ssi": "Theofanie", "first_name_ssi": "Alexia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Robert Paulson", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Avery August, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella", "Itk", "IL-2", "Pertussis toxin", "Type VI Secretion System"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "STUDIES TOWARD THE SYNTHESIS OF TMC-95A AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN ENANTIOSELECTIVE PUMMERER REACTION FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF 3,3-SPIROCYCLIC OXINDOLES\n", "id": "7044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Oxidative cyclizations of tryptophan derivatives have seen little use in total synthesis.

We study the nature of price competition for information in this environment. The linear network, when the agents are located at the integer points of the real line, is a specific example I completely characterize. For the linear network there always exists a stationary equilibrium, where the strategies do not depend on time. I show that there is an equilibrium where any agent has a nonzero probability of staying uninformed forever. Under certain initial conditions this equilibrium is a limit of equilibria of finite-horizon games. The role of a transversality condition is emphasized, namely that the price in the transaction should not exceed the expected utility of all the agents who get the information due to the transaction. I show that the price offered does not converge to zero with time.\n\nThe second essay focuses on the problem of using idiosyncratic shocks and random matchings. Many economic models use a continuum of negligible agents to avoid considering one person's effect on aggregate characteristics of the economy. Along with a continuum of agents, these models often incorporate a sequence of independent shocks and random matchings. Despite frequent use of such models, there  are still unsolved questions about their mathematical justification. In this paper we construct a discrete time framework, in which major desirable properties of idiosyncratic shocks and random matchings hold. In this framework the agent space constitutes a probability space, and the probability distribution for each agent is replaced by  the population distribution. Unlike previous authors, we question  the assumption of known identity - the location on the agent space. We assume that the agents only know  their previous history - what had  happened to them before, - but not their identity. The construction justifies the use of numerous dynamic models of idiosyncratic shocks and random matchings.\n\nThe third essay examines inefficient equilibria in Games Played Through Agents. Games Played through Agents is a class of complete information games with multiple principles and multiple agents. Previous studies found conditions for the existence of the efficient equilibria, in which the sum of all the payoffs is maximized. In this paper, we prove that for a game with two principals and one agent only, any inefficient equilibrium is Pareto-dominated by an efficient one. A counterexample shows that this result does not hold for more than two principals. We also demonstrate that any efficient equilibrium is weakly dominated by the Truthful Nash Equilibrium.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [324], "author_name_tesi": "Karavaev, Andrei ", "last_name_ssi": "Karavaev", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Andrei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Sophie Bade", "Leonid N Vaserstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Sophie Bade, Committee Member", "Leonid N Vaserstein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["game theory", "Microeconomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Therapeutic utility of targeting protein synthetic machinery in melanoma", "id": "23537", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10656", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Malignant melanoma is a cancer with few treatment options and thus, a very poor prognosis.  Targeted therapies directed at commonly over-activated signaling pathways in melanoma have limited success due to development of drug resistance.  The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways are commonly over-activated in melanoma.  Both pathways regulate protein synthetic machinery through RNA polymerase I transcription and mRNA translation initiation.  Resistance to mutant V600EBRAF targeted therapies can be mediated through the mRNA translation initiation complex eIF4F, revealing that the therapeutic efficacy of MAPK targeting in melanoma is mediated though protein synthesis.  Thus, common drivers of melanoma progression regulate protein synthesis to promote melanoma development.  Since protein synthesis deregulation is a critical facilitator of melanoma development, regulation of protein synthesis is a potential therapeutic approach to impair melanoma growth.\n\tThe aim of this dissertation is to identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of malignant melanoma.  The protein synthetic machinery is an attractive target to therapeutically investigate.  Ribosome biogenesis is one component of this machinery, which is required for proper ribosome formation.  Disruption of ribosome biogenesis can impair ribosome production and activate a stress response mediated by p53.  Chapter 2 discusses how targeting ribosomal proteins such as RPL13 impaired melanoma growth by decreasing protein synthesis and stabilizing p53.   Another approach to impair protein synthesis is by disruption of mRNA translation initiation.  Translation initiation requires the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2.  Stresses such as amino acid insufficiency cause the phosphorylation and inactivation of the \u03b1 subunit of eIF2 by GCN2.  Chapter 3 investigates how proline biosynthesis disruption by targeting ALDH18A1 with siRNA to deplete P5CS protein activated GCN2, impaired protein synthesis, and decreased melanoma tumor growth.  Neither RPL13 nor P5CS are currently druggable targets.  A major limitation of targeted therapies is the inability to effectively and specifically disrupt many targets.  RNA interference (RNAi) by the delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) in liposomes offers a potential solution to these limitations.  Chapter 4 examines the utility of targeting RPL13 or ALDH18A1 via siRNA-loaded nanoliposomes for the therapeutic treatment of melanoma.\n\tThe protein synthetic machinery is a key mediator of melanoma development.  Ribosome biogenesis is one component capable of modulating protein synthesis through ribosome production.  In chapter 2, the role of large subunit ribosomal proteins (RPLs) in melanoma was dissected to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting RPLs.  Based on the consequences of siRNA-mediated knockdown, two groups of RPLs were identified and categorized with respect to their effects on melanoma cell viability and protein synthesis.  Targeting the first group negligibly affected cell viability and protein synthesis while targeting the second group significantly decreased cell viability and protein synthesis.  A subset of this second group was capable of stabilizing p53 following protein knockdown.  Targeting RPL13, a representative of this group, increased p53 stability mediated by the inhibition of MDM2 by RPL5 and RPL11.  RPL13 knockdown caused p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, decreased protein synthesis, and impaired melanoma tumor development.  Thus, certain ribosomal proteins can be therapeutically targeted for the treatment of melanoma.\n\tRegulation of mRNA translation initiation can also modulate protein synthesis.  The ternary complex of met-tRNA, eIF2, and GTP is necessary for mRNA translation initiation to proceed.  Regulation of this complex through eIF2 controls protein synthesis.  Amino acid insufficiency can activate the GCN2 kinase to inactivate eIF2.  Aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family, member A1 (ALDH18A1) encodes pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), an enzyme necessary for proline biosynthesis.  Chapter 3 studies the effect of impairing proline biosynthesis on melanoma development.  siRNA targeting of ALDH18A1 decreased intracellular proline levels by 66 to 85% and decreased melanoma cell growth rate by 56 to 96% without affecting apoptosis, autophagy, or cell cycle arrest.  Melanoma tumor growth was inhibited by 45 to 99% upon ALDH18A1 inhibition.  Mechanistically, ALDH18A1 knockdown proline-dependently activated the GCN2 pathway and impaired protein synthesis.  Collectively, these data suggest that the protein synthetic machinery can be impaired by proline biosynthesis disruption, providing a novel therapeutic target for melanoma treatment.\n\tChapters 2 and 3 discuss novel therapeutic targets capable of disrupting the protein synthetic machinery to impair melanoma growth, however neither target is currently druggable.  To overcome this limitation, chapter 4 investigates the use of siRNA-encapsulated liposomes to target RPL13 or ALDH18A1 in melanoma.  Transfection of melanoma cells with liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD) complexes carrying siRNA targeting RPL13 or ALDH18A1 knocked down target protein levels and inhibited melanoma cell viability by up to 50%.  Melanoma xenograft mice treated with siRNA-LPD complexes decreased melanoma tumor growth by 40 to 55%.  These results suggest that RPL13 and ALDH18A1 are effective targets for melanoma treatment however better approaches are needed to improve upon the limitations of targeted therapies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10288], "author_name_tesi": "Kardos, Gregory Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Kardos", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson", "Jin Ming Yang", "Gregory Steven Yochum", "Scot R Kimball"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson, Dissertation Advisor", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Gregory Steven Yochum, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["melanoma", "RPL13", "ALDH18A1", "ribosome", "proline", "nanoliposome", "protein synthesis", "P5CS", "GCN2", "eIF2alpha"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Pyrite Framboid Size Distributions in the Union Springs Member, Marcellus Formation and Implications for Paleowater Column Euxinia", "id": "27457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Numerous studies have evaluated both modern and ancient environments and have shown that size distributions of framboid diameters can be used to interpret the location of the redox boundary relative to the sediment-water interface at the time of framboid formation (e.g. Wilkin et al., 1996; Wilkin et al., 1997; Wignall and Newton, 1998; Bond and Wignall, 2010). In an environment with a euxinic/dysoxic-oxic boundary within the water column, framboid size distributions will have a narrow range with a small mean diameter. In environments where the same boundary is at or below the sediment-water interface, framboids are able to grow to larger sizes and typically have a wider range and a larger mean diameter (Wilkin et al., 1996). \nBased on this premise, more than 12,000 framboids were measured at 90 sample depths and analyzed in order to interpret paleowater column chemistry through the deposition of the top of the Onondaga Formation and Union Springs member of the Marcellus Formation. Two cores were utilized \u2013 the Snow Shoe and the Kenny Erb \u2013 with the investigation focusing on the Snow Shoe, which is thought to represent the distal basin. \nThe two sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to compare framboid diameter statistics from all samples within each well, which facilitated discretization of groups of samples with similar characteristics. Based on the results of this exercise, nine groups were defined; five in the Snow Shoe well and four in the Kenny Erb well. It was found that these groups aligned well with major changes in geochemical attributes as well as observations of rock characteristics made both macroscopically and microscopically. Additionally, it was found that groups 2, 3, 4 and 5, (identified in the Snow Shoe well) were equivalent to groups 6, 7, 8, and 9 (identified in the Kenny Erb well), respectively.   \nGroup 1 is from the Snow Shoe well and does not have an equivalent in the Kenny Erb well. This group is associated with the Onondaga Formation and was found to have a framboid size distribution similar to those described by Wilkin et al. (1997) for units deposited under an oxic water column in the Holocene Black Sea. Samples that belong to groups 2 and 6 are found primarily in the top of the Onondaga Formation. The framboid size distributions in these groups were comparable to those found in modern dysoxic-oxic environments discussed by Wilkin et al. (1996). Samples belonging to groups 3 and 7 are associated the transition between the Onondaga and Marcellus, and although they are mapped in the euxinic zone presented by Wilkin et al. (1996), framboid diameters are typically slightly larger than those reported by Wilkin et al. (1997) from Holocene Black Sea units deposited under a euxinic water column. Group 4 and 8 samples are typically found in the Lower Union Springs member and fall definitively into the euxinic zone presented by Wilkin et al. (1996), as do samples belonging to groups 5 and 9, which are typically found in the Upper Union Springs member. Interestingly, group 5 and 9 samples have smaller mean diameters and narrower size distributions than samples from groups 4 and 8. \nGeochemical systems and observations outlined by Wendt et al. (2015) were used, in conjunction framboid size distribution observations, to establish the history of water column euxinia from the top of the Onondaga Formation through the Union Springs member of the Marcellus Formation. These metrics indicate that the top of the Onondaga Formation was deposited under a dysoxic to oxic water column, and that bottom water euxinia set in during the transition to the Union Springs member. During the deposition of the Lower Union Springs member, bottom waters were euxinic, but the redox boundary was dynamic and often approached the sediment-water interface. This period is also marked by high productivity and sediment starvation, which allowed for the creation of a highly condensed section. During the deposition of the Upper Union Springs member, framboid size distributions indicate that the redox boundary was established in the water column, away from the sediment-water interface, implying that sustained water column stratification persisted. Although these conditions differ from interpreted water column chemistry presented by Kohl et al. (2014), the results of this study support the overall sequence stratigraphic framework of Kohl et al. (2014).\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11555], "author_name_tesi": "Karduck, Scott Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Karduck", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus Euxinia Framboid"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Clustering and classification of images based on salient data points", "id": "28878", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12412", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis work, we consider the problem of object clustering and classification from a set of images.

Among all the GI cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) (New cases: 134,490 deaths: 49,190) and pancreatic cancer (PC) (New cases: 53,070 deaths: 41,780) have high mortality rates.  Current therapies result in minimal survival advantage and are linked to multiple adverse events and drug resistance. Further, inflammation has been linked towards initiation and metastasis of both PC and CRC. Literature reports show that the inflammatory pathways like NF-\u0138B and STAT3 are constitutively active and have shown to play an important role in resistance towards chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel chemotherapeutic agents, that target such inflammatory pathways, with enhanced potency and reduced toxicity to enhance survival and improve patient\u2019s quality of life. \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSIADs), specifically aspirin (ASA), have been highlighted for their chemopreventive properties and anti-inflammatory activities. Recent studies suggest that long term use of ASA reduces the risk of both CRC and PC. However, long term use, as is required in a prevention setting, and the high dose, lead to GI toxicity; e.g. GI bleeding and ulcer formation. Therefore, many efforts are being made to generate novel ASA analogs with reduced GI toxicity, so as not only to achieve a preventive effect at lower doses but increased efficacy towards killing cancer cells to extend their use as therapeutics. Further, selenium containing molecules have gained a lot of attention for their chemopreventive potential and anticancer activities. Selenium containing molecules have also demonstrated to have gastro-protective effects like accelerating ulcer healing as well as reducing NSAIDs induced ulcer formation. Hence, we hypothesize that combining both ASA and selenium will lead to discovery of novel agents with potent anti-cancer activities while having minimal associated GI toxicity. Through extensive structure-activity relationship studies of novel compounds designed by incorporating selenium into the NSAIDs, we recently identified two novel ASA-selenium hybrid molecules (AS-10 and Comp 8), that showed potent anti-cancer activities against both CRC and PC. \nComp 8, was designed by incorporating ethyl selenocyanate moiety into carboxylic acid moiety of ASA. AS-10 on the other hand, was generated via novel synthesis pattern to contain a cyclic selenazolidine ring flanked by two acetyl salicylate moieties similar to ASA. Our mechanistic studies show that both agents exhibit similar mechanism of action in PC and CRC.  They both inhibited the activation of pro-inflammatory and pro-survival NF-\u0138B pathway, when PC cells were stimulated with inflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03b1), at a similar potency. They also reduced the expression of NF-\u0138B down-stream anti-apoptotic targets like Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 and survivin. Further, they induced intrinsic form of apoptosis via caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation. Notably, AS-10 was more effective at inhibiting PC growth, and hence we explored its mechanism of action further. AS-10 increased the expression of p21 and p27 at early time points (compared to Comp 8) which arrested cell cycle at G1/G0 and G2/M phase. Cell cycle arrest was later translated to apoptosis. AS-10 also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and quenching of ROS via N-acetylcysteine, led to reduction of AS-10\u2019s anti-cancer activity. Moreover, similar mechanism of action was seen in CRC, where both agents were able to induce cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptosis. \nOur findings show that both agents are more potent at inhibiting cancer cell growth compared to current first line therapies for both PC and CRC. Notably, AS-10 also potentiated the effectiveness of gemcitabine, first line therapy for PC, in gemcitabine resistant PC cell line. Additionally, both agents are more selective towards cancer cells than normal cells, making them clinically more significant. Moreover, we also tested the broad spectrum activity of AS-10 and Comp 8 in different cancer types. Effectiveness of AS-10 was further tested in an even broader range of cancers via National Cancer institute\u2019s (NCI\u2019s) drug screening program in 60 human cancer cell lines which contains cell lines from nine different types of cancer; AS-10 was effective in different cancer types, out of which renal cancer cells were most sensitive. Taken together, our in vitro results suggest both Comp 8 and AS-10 as promising novel chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of CRC and PC. However, based on our preliminary MTD studies in nude mice, AS-10 was found ~5 times more tolerable, and hence could prove to be a potent anti-cancer agent with high therapeutic index. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12108], "author_name_tesi": "Karelia, Deepkamal Nilkamal", "last_name_ssi": "Karelia", "middle_name_ssi": "Nilkamal", "first_name_ssi": "Deepkamal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arun Kumar Sharma", "Arun Kumar Sharma", "Shantu G Amin", "Jong Kak Yun", "Victor J Ruiz-Velasco", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arun Kumar Sharma, Dissertation Advisor", "Arun Kumar Sharma, Committee Chair", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Victor J Ruiz-Velasco, Outside Member", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pancreatic cancer", "colorectal cancer", "small molecule", "NSAIDs", "apoptotsis", "inflammatory pathways", "selenium", "aspirin", "cell cycle", "MTT", "EMSA", "Panc-1"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Re-theorizing Fanon Through Derrida, Deleuze, and Mbembe", "id": "27388", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12068", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In my dissertation I explore four specific themes in the work of Frantz Fanon: race, hospitality, language, and violence. Although a fair number of works have been published on these particulars issues, especially on the question of race and violence, I argue that they have been undertheorized and, as a result, misunderstood. To interpret Fanon\u2019s work in our contemporary context I draw on the political philosophies of Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze, and Achille Mbembe. In chapter one, I revisit the question of race in Fanon\u2019s work and explore the historical, political, and philosophical reasons behind the general success of a specific portion of his work (notably Black Skin, White Masks) as opposed to his later interventions on race in Wretched of the Earth or Toward an African Revolution. It is in this chapter that I build the case as to how Fanon\u2019s work on race was prematurely and inadequately categorized under what we today may call \u201cracial eliminativism\u201d. I argue that Fanon\u2019s anti-racism discourse is bound up with his specific understanding of culture in the context on postindependence/postcolonial politics. In chapter two, I take up what Achille Mbembe\u2019s has called Fanon\u2019s politics of dis-enclosure and I contend that, far more than critics have been willing to recognize, Fanon\u2019s anti-racial nationalism and his idiosyncratic conception of culture give way to a kind radical theory of cosmopolitanism and hospitality. Here I specifically rely on the work of Derrida and I argue that, in fact, Fanon\u2019s concrete experience validates Derridean politics of unconditionality. In chapter 3, I return to a rather controversial text in his early work: chapter 1 of Black Skin, White Masks devoted to the question of colonial language. I argue that far beyond merely rejecting the colonial language and allegedly advocating for the use of indigenous languages, Fanon was primarily interested in finding a revolutionary language regardless of its cultural origin. I take his multiple attempt to re-appropriate Enlightenment\u2019s ethical language as a case in point. In this chapter, I also use the work of Derrida on \u201cmonolinguism\u201d and Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s theory of minor language and, as in the previous chapter, argue that Fanon\u2019s life and work exemplify the concrete dimensions of Derrida, Deleuze, and Guattari\u2019s formal structures. Finally, in chapter 4, I return to the much-heated debate around the question of violence. I argue that Fanon\u2019s messianic discourse on violence was never na\u00efve. Instead I propose to take seriously into consideration the anxiety that always accompanied his exhortation and hyperbolic discourses on the issue.

Pavement management system (PMS) is a subset of transportation infrastructure asset management that covers all the activities involved in providing and maintaining pavements at an adequate level of service. Increased pavement deterioration and increased performance demands along with limited budget and human resources have all made pavement management a critical and challenging task.\nProbably the most critical analysis tools in every PMS are condition evaluation, performance prediction, needs assessment, prioritization and optimization toolboxes. However, it is not easy to develop these toolboxes in a reliable fashion. Often, agencies have to deal with incomplete, subjective, ambiguous, uncertain, or erroneous information that makes the developed analysis tools, and, in turn, the decision-making process very unreliable or even irrational. Therefore, there is a need for more capable computational tools that can handle problems such as numerical intensity or ambiguous subjectivity within the collected data. \nComputational intelligence methods, including machine learning (ML) techniques, and evolutionary algorithms (EA) have been demonstrated to be promising in addressing these difficulties involved in the development of PMS analysis tools. The general goal of this dissertation is to enhance the analytical toolboxes for pavement condition evaluation and performance prediction via integration of computational intelligence techniques. \nCombining the computational efficiency of artificial neural networks (ANN) with the reliability and effectiveness of EA paradigms resulted in superior backcalculation of flexible pavement structural properties, compared to conventional available software. The developed backcalculation methodology results in lower deflection-matching errors and is independent of seed values. In addition, a backcalculation methodology considering pavement behavior under different load levels was developed using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The multi-objective approach allows implementation of more available deflection data in order to provide better insight into the complex backcalculation problem. Using MOEA in backcalculation of deflection data from FHWA\u2019s long-term pavement performance (LTPP) study resulted in more consistent moduli along each pavement section, compared to conventional single objective routines.\nA framework is provided for the development and implementation of an ANN performance prediction model in a network-level PMS. The developed pavement roughness prediction model has superior prediction capability compared to multivariate nonlinear regression models, demonstrated by better generalization of performance trends. An example illustrates the implementation of the roughness model along with life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) in making future pavement rehabilitation recommendations.\nComparing machine learning techniques, the most suitable for pavement performance prediction is determined through rigorous testing. Preprocessing of data using normalization and principal component analysis simplifies the developed prediction model and avoids correlation of input variables. Feed-forward and cascade-forward ANN, support vector machines (SVM), and radial basis function (RBF) networks are contrasted regarding their prediction capability. The developed models do not require previous knowledge about the equation form and can accommodate noisy data. Variants of these learning paradigms were compared using quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including evaluation of model accuracy, generalization capability, parsimony, sensitivity to changes in input factors, and predicted deterioration progression rates. \nOverall, this study provides a framework for integration of computational intelligence in backcalculation and performance modeling towards more effective, efficient, and reliable PMS toolboxes compared to previously available solutions. Superior performance of ML techniques in function approximation compared to multivariate nonlinear regression, and EAs in complex optimization compared to exhaustive search routines, have contributed in this regard.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8919], "author_name_tesi": "Kargah Ostadi, Nima ", "last_name_ssi": "Kargah Ostadi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nima", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Mansour Solaimanian", "Patrick M Reed", "Catherine Mary Harmonosky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels, Dissertation Advisor", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Chair", "Mansour Solaimanian, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Catherine Mary Harmonosky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pavement management", "backcalculation", "performance model", "computational intelligence", "neural network", "evolutionary algorithms"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "X-ray and optical emission from Neutron Stars and Pulsar Wind Nebulae", "id": "6423", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4839", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is devoted to X-ray and optical-UV observations of\nNeutron Stars (NSs) and Pulsar-Wind nebulae (PWNe).\n\n\nPart I of the dissertation describes the UV and X-ray observations\nof the famous Vela pulsar and its spectacular PWN.

The study emanated from a series of interviews and prolonged contact with 13 young female survivors. Although the issue of violence and oppression of women has been observed across all cultures, the severity of the problem is higher in developing countries where gender inequality is far broader than in developed part of the world. Among various types of abuse and violent acts against them, the heinous act of acid attack has become another means to take away the freedom of living a normal life among many girls and young women. Although the Acid attack victims suffer from the pain of disfigurement, social discriminations and from a perception of loss of self-control and competence, they also learned to find ways to bring back some normalcy in their lives.  In this context, the study found leisure to play a significant role in the lives of the survivors to provide them with a sense of normalcy and a sense of connection.\n\nThe study investigated the different types of leisure involvement among the survivors and tried to understand the emotions and motivations behind the participation amidst the cultural backdrops of Bangladesh. Thus the study explores the different perception of leisure among the survivors in different contexts that involved family, peers and friends, and the community. The barriers to participation were also analyzed to comprehend how the social, cultural, structural and personal barriers are impacting their leisure participation. This understanding also lead to explore the negotiation strategies used by some of the survivors to overcome the barriers to be involved in leisure activities of their choice and therefore able to enjoy the benefits from the participation. Overall, the study opens up new doors to understand the aspect of leisure in the lives of the female acid attack survivors in which social and individual leisure played a major role to help them find meaning in life once again after their sense of freedom and security was lost from the tragic incident of acid attack. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7198], "author_name_tesi": "Karim, Rehnuma ", "last_name_ssi": "Karim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rehnuma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Linda Caldwell", "Dr. Linda Caldwell", "Garry Chick", "John Dattilo", "Constance A Flanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Linda Caldwell, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Linda Caldwell, Committee Chair", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "John Dattilo, Committee Member", "Constance A Flanagan, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acid attack", "Survivors", "Women's Leisure", "Leisure experiences", "Leisure Constraints"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "GEO-ANNOTATION AND GEOPARSING OF TEXTUAL DOCUMENTS", "id": "15266muk229", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Geoparsing is the process of automatically recognizing place references in unstructured text and resolving those references to corresponding geographic coordinates.

The results reveal that in the first growing season inbred plants \nproduced only 37% as many seeds as outbred plants (inbreeding depression, \u03b4 = 0.63), much \nhigher than that previously reported from a greenhouse study that employed a larger set of \nhorsenettle genets (\u03b4 = 0.17). I also found that outbred genets produced >2.5 times as many \nramets as inbred genets in the spring of year two, and that inbreeding depression increased both per ramet and per genet from year 1 to year 2. The application (every other week) of an \ninsecticide on one of the two replicate fields yielded small decreases in overall levels of \nherbivory that coincided with similar changes in estimates of inbreeding depression per ramet \n(from 0.79 to 0.68 in year 2). The results from this study show that inbred plants exhibited \nslower growth and reduced reproductive output relative to outbred plants, suggesting they are \nlikely to linger in vulnerable stages of development and have fewer resources to devote to chemical defenses and volatile signaling. Since my results clearly demonstrate that inbreeding depression in horsenettle under field conditions is greater over 2 years of growth, S. carolinense \nis likely not in transition from SI ( Self-Incompatibility) to self-compatibility. Rather, the \nplasticity in the SI system may be part of a stable mixed mating system that permits the plants to self-fertilize when cross pollen limits seed production and/or when few S-alleles are present in the population. \nIn chapter 3, I examined whether plant volatile signaling phenotypes can act as an indirect form \nof plant defense against herbivores. Specifically, I tested the effects of inbreeding on constitutive volatile emissions and emissions induced in response to feeding by the lepidopteran herbivore Manduca sexta, and the composition of the arthropod community subsequently recruited to herbivore-damaged and undamaged plants (in a large-scale field survey). My results show that inbreeding resulted in higher levels of constitutive volatile emissions attracting more herbivores \nto inbred plants whereas undamaged outcrossed plants (quieter than undamaged inbred plants) \nwere less attractive to generalist herbivores. Inbred plants also exhibited weaker volatile \ninduction in response to herbivore damage. Breeding status significantly influenced the attraction of herbivorous and predatory insects to horsenettle plants in the field: Hymenopteran predators and parasitoids were significantly more prevalent on damaged outcrossed plants than on damaged inbred plants. In contrast, inbred plants attracted significantly higher levels of \ngeneralist coleopteran herbivores and dipterans regardless of damage status. Taken together, the \nmost significant finding of this study is that inbreeding negatively impacts the overall volatile signalling phenotype. This study also reveals a likely cost of inbreeding for Solanum carolinense that complements previous reports of reduced fitness under field conditions. The results from the field experiment also support the hypothesis that induced-plant signalling is an adaptive form of indirect plant defense. \nIn chapter 4, I examined whether physical structural defenses such as trichomes and spines, primarily considered as the first line of defense against herbivores, are also affected by inbreeding. My data clearly demonstrate that inbreeding adversely affects both constitutive and induced physical defenses in horsenettle. Specifically, we found that inbred plants produce fewer abaxial and adaxial leaf trichomes and internode spines than outbred plants, and that foliar damage by the larvae of a specialist herbivore, M. sexta, induces more leaf trichomes on the new leaves and more internode spines on the outbred plants. I also found that the induction of physical defenses as well as any underlying chemical defenses are likely to have incurred a cost. \nInduced plants, regardless of the type of damage, had shorter internodes, delayed in flowering and produced fewer flowers during the course of the experiment.  \nIn chapter 5, I examined whether inbreeding also affects susceptibility to pathogens. In a \ncontrolled greenhouse experiment, we examined the incidence of powdery mildew (Oidium \nneolycopersici) on undamaged, caterpillar damaged and mechanically damaged inbred and \noutbred horsenettle. I found that powdery mildew has a more rapid onset of infection in inbred \nplants, particularly when plants were not previously damaged. On the other hand, 3 days after the initial observation, I also found that powdery mildew infestation had swept to high levels across all breeding and damage treatments. These data suggest that inbreeding may increase plant susceptibility to pathogen infection and, therefore, may potentially facilitate pathogen establishment in natural populations. The observation of higher levels of powdery mildew infection in undamaged compared to damaged plants at the first time point furthermore suggests that defense responses induced by the damage treatments may have provided some level of initial resistance. \nTo explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in plant defenses against \nherbivory caused by inbreeding, I carried out a transcriptome profiling of damaged and \nundamaged (Manduca sexta ), inbred and outbred horsenettle ramets using the commercially \navailable tomato microarray chip. The microarray analyses demonstrate that herbivore damage \nup-regulates numerous genes in defense pathways while down-regulating several general growth \nand photosynthesis-related genes, and the analysis of damaged inbred and outbred plants showed that inbreeding affects the pattern of gene expression and that outbred plants have significantly greater expression of genes involved in defense pathways, than inbred plants. This study explained in chapter 6 provides clues into the genetic causes of the differences in resistance that we observed in the field between inbred and outbred plants as discussed in chapter 3. \nExperiments on how inbreeding affects plant defense against herbivory also leads to questions on how these defense signalling plant phenotypes can affect interactions with beneficial and antagonistic insects. Building on the results from our tritrophic interactions experiment described in chapter 3, I investigated whether inbreeding in horsenettle affects the quantity and composition of night-emitted volatile blends, and whether M. sexta females have an oviposition preference of for inbred vs. outcrossed plants, both in the absence and presence of visual and contact cues. My results suggest that inbreeding negatively affects overall nighttime volatile emissions by disrupting the emission of compounds that serve to deter oviposition by M. sexta, and by changing the ratios of emitted compounds. As a result, M. sexta females laid significantly \nmore eggs on inbred plants in choice tests when compared to outbred plants, even when given \naccess to only volatile cues. These experiments constitute chapter 7 of the dissertation.

Reports have also indicated that more than one chemokine receptor might be involved skin inflammation.\nAlthough studies such as neutralization of CCL27, the ligand for CCR10, suggested that CCR10 might be important for skin inflammation, there is no direct evidence confirming this as of yet.

Transition programs have gained popularity for this reason.  These programs are intended to help adult learners enroll in postsecondary education (Alamprese, 2005).  The state of the literature on these programs demonstrates a need for more research about the outcomes associated with participation.  Previous research on adult learner participation in transition programs is limited in its scope and depth (Valentine, Hirschy, Bremer, Novillo, Castellano, & Banister, 2009).  To add to the literature, this study is designed to capture and explore the stories of adult learners enrolled in a transition program to examine their experiences and perceptions.\n\tWhen researching adult learner transition to higher education, I came across numerous studies reporting the challenges and barriers that hinder adult learner success.  I also found that the challenges and barriers discussed in recent literature are the same as those described over three decades ago by Patricia Cross (1981).  Therefore, this research also aims to explore to what extent these barrier types identified in Cross\u2019s (1981) survey research adequately reflect the experiences of adult learners entering higher education today and to provide an updated account of the obstacles that adult learners face.  \n\nTheoretical Framework and Method\n\tThis study is a narrative inquiry shaped by the theoretical framework of Schlossberg\u2019s Transition Theory (Anderson, Schlossberg, & Goodman, 2012) and Cross\u2019s (1991) categories of adult learner barriers.  For data analysis, I used the hermeneutic approach as described by Patterson and Williams (2002).  I followed this approach to analyze each participant\u2019s narrative.  I also engaged in cross-case narrative analysis, determining the similarities and differences between the participants\u2019 narratives.\n\nFindings\nThe findings suggest that the connections the participants formed during enrollment in \u201cTransitions Prep\u201d attributed to an overall positive experience for all.  The narratives of this study also indicate that the participants\u2019 perspectives of the transition to higher education changed through participation in \u201cTransitions Prep.\u201d  Although one participated reported a loss of confidence in her ability to be successful in higher education, the majority of the participants described themselves as having gained confidence.  Additionally, the findings of this study imply that adult learners may face challenges not fully addressed by Cross\u2019s (1991) account of adult learner barriers to higher education.  Lastly, I found that the stages to self-actualization from Maslow\u2019s (1943) Hierarchy of Needs explain the participant motivations more precisely than the theories used to inform the theoretical framework of this study. \n\nRecommendations\nBased on the findings, I recommend that research on the outcomes of participation in a transition program be conducted.  I also recommend that Schlossberg\u2019s Transition Theory and Cross\u2019s (1991) categorizations of student barriers be reconceptualized to give more emphasis on the influence of identity and be reconsidered within the current social context.  Additionally, I encourage researchers to contemplate how elements of self-actualization may help to explain adult learner motivations for entering higher education.  Furthermore, I suggest additional research to uncover the true impact of funding on transition program development and determine appropriate requirements for program design.  \nFor future practice, I suggest that universities and colleges implement research-based supports, including transition programs, to aid adult learners as they attempt to earn postsecondary degrees.  In addition, I suggest that higher education institutions be mindful of how aging poses physical limitations for adult learners and consider how to best provide appropriate accommodations for aging adult students. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11679], "author_name_tesi": "Karmelita, Courtney E", "last_name_ssi": "Karmelita", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adnan A Qayyum", "Adnan A Qayyum", "Melody M Thompson", "David Post", "Margaret Ann Lorah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adnan A Qayyum, Dissertation Advisor", "Adnan A Qayyum, Committee Chair", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member", "David Post, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult learners", "transition", "higher education", "adult learner barriers", "transition theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Synoptic and mesoscale climate forcing on Antarctic ice shelf surface melt dynamics", "id": "17395", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8465", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Given that the polar regions, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, have experienced one of the largest temperature increases on Earth over the last few decades, an understanding of Antarctic climate has become more urgent. Ice shelves themselves are located at the intersection of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and the cryosphere\u2014the air-ice-ocean boundary, and are sensitive to changes in any of these media. In addition to being particularly sensitive to changes in climate, ice shelves play an important role in controlling the flow of glaciers into the ocean, which has important implications for sea level changes. In a warming world, an increased understanding of how climate change is affecting Antarctic ice shelves is valuable for assessing vulnerable regions of the Antarctic that may be prone to further instability. This work focuses on determining the underlying climatic processes controlling energy and mass balance responsible for driving melting over ice shelves. A novel melt-magnitude retrieval method is presented that uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived near-IR reflectance coupled with ice surface temperature as a proxy for surface melt magnitude. This method has a higher spatial resolution than passive microwave melt detection, has the added benefit of retrieving melt magnitude rather than a binary melt occurrence or non-occurrence, but has a lower temporal resolution than either passive-microwave or microwave-scatterometry melt detection. This limitation is a result of the opacity of cloud cover to both visible and IR radiation, requiring more satellite overpasses to obtain spatially contiguous imagery. This work also examines several weather variables associated with a large-extent, long-duration surface melt event on the Ross Ice Shelf. It is shown that cloudy conditions coupled with increased sensible and latent heat flux to the surface were present during the event, and these conditions are consistent with those that induce surface melting. Finally, an analysis of co-occurring climate conditions and surface melting over a recent 15-year time period (1987-2002) is presented. This analysis examines surface melt extent in three regions: Ross Ice Shelf, Larsen Ice Shelf and the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Region. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are used to categorize weather patterns for each December and January day during the study period, and the average surface melt extent for each SOM pattern is computed. These values are compared to average December and January surface melt extents for each region to determine the SOM patterns associated with significantly greater or significantly less melt than the 15-year average. Over the Ross region, increases in sensible and latent heat fluxes are associated with greater surface melt extent, as is the presence of cyclonic circulation in the Ross Sea that drives mild maritime air poleward. In the Larsen and Amundsen-Bellingshausen regions, radiation fluxes appear to be more closely associated with surface melt extent, although the relationship for the geographically heterogeneous Amundsen-Bellingshausen region is less clear. These results can guide future mesoscale modeling studies that will be able to more precisely determine the causative role of each atmospheric variable in generating surface melting on West Antarctic ice shelves.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8370], "author_name_tesi": "Karmosky, Christopher Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Karmosky", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derrick Lampkin", "Derrick Lampkin", "Andrew Mark Carleton", "Richard B Alley", "Michael Mann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derrick Lampkin, Dissertation Advisor", "Derrick Lampkin, Committee Chair", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member", "Richard B Alley, Committee Member", "Michael Mann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antarctica", "Ross Ice Shelf", "Larsen Ice Shelf", "Self-Organizing Maps", "Surface Melt", "MODIS", "Remote Sensing", "Climate", "Climatology"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Power Optimization in Bluetooth Low Energy implemented through a System on Chip NRF51 and Apple Notification Center Services", "id": "12604dzk5214", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the field of wireless communication, consumption of power has become a major issue.

In order to understand how learners stayed motivated in a college setting, I selected participants who were in their second year of the TAA program.  A total of eleven (out of a population of twenty-two) TAA students participated in this study. \n            Using semi-structured interview data, observations, and document analysis, six themes emerged:  1) Gaining Opportunities, 2) Supportive Environments, 3) Traveling in the Dark, 4) Coming to Terms and Accepting the Situations, 5) Obstacles, and 6) Gender Issues.  This study suggests that TAA participants are motivated to work toward completion of their college degrees despite the obstacles they encounter even though evidence suggests that displaced workers earn significantly less than at their previous jobs.  However, training programs at educational institutions have reaped monetary benefits for the institution through the TAA program. \nThis study shed some light on the 2 X 2 model of achievement motivation framework established by Elliot and McGregor (2001).  Although a forced-choice questionnaire was not used with the TAA participants, the 2 X 2 framework \u2013 2 (mastery vs. performance) x 2 (approach vs. avoidance) \u2013 provided a partial way of understanding TAA participants\u2019 motivations.  The mastery goal concept stood out because participants wanted to master the course material in order to move forward with their programs.  Even when obstacles surfaced, participants did not demonstrate characteristics of avoidance.  However, the 2 X 2 framework has a narrow focus and was not sufficient to entirely explain TAA participants\u2019 motivations.  As a result, the study suggests that motivation is a multi-faceted concept that is outcome-based and might best be understood by what is accomplished through individuals' actions.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7399], "author_name_tesi": "Karnes, Sandra Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Karnes", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied", "Fred Michael Schied", "Melody M Thompson", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Chair", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TAA program", "Adult Education", "Second Year College Students"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF A CHECKLIST ON SCHOOL TEAMS\u2019 PLANS FOR AUGMENTATIVE AND ALTERNATIVE COMMUNICATION ASSESSMENTS", "id": "15034jlb733", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15034", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children with complex communication needs (CCN) require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to participate in home, school, and community environments, but many school teams are unprepared to provide effective AAC assessments.

The primary goal of the project was to implement an improved annealing heat treatment \u2018on-heat\u2019 detection method capable of quantitatively determining when a load of metal within a furnace reaches its target temperature.  Current practice techniques are subjective and inherently induce overly conservative heat treatment cycles.  By more quantitative control of heat treatment cycles, the point in time when the load uniformly reached its target temperature could be determined with increased precision.  This precision could facilitate shorter, less conservative heat treatment cycles with process time savings and energy savings.\nThree different approaches for achieving quantitative on-heat determinism were surveyed including: heat transfer modeling, analysis of furnace gas consumption, and analysis of load surface temperature using an infrared sensor (OP-AID method).  By comparison of these different approaches, the best control strategy capable of significant reductions in heat treatment cycle times was found to be the OP-AID method.  Although the control strategy based on furnace gas consumption proved to be effective, its responsiveness was degraded by the amount of signal filtering it required.  Also, since the OP-AID method reacted directly to the surface temperature of the load, it could better ensure product quality compared to the gas flow rate analysis that reacted indirectly to the furnace environment temperature.\nAdditionally, an analysis was conducted to study the balance between metallurgical constraints vs. cost constraints in the design of the OP-AID method.  The aggressiveness associated with achieving time savings opposed the maximization of metallurgical specifications (load temperature uniformity), and this balance was quantified through a multi-criteria analysis.  Through this analysis it was found that the parameters of the OP-AID method could provide heat treatment cost savings with sufficient product quality.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6134], "author_name_tesi": "Karnezos, Thomas C.P.", "last_name_ssi": "Karnezos", "middle_name_ssi": "C.P.", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Robert Carl Voigt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["heat transfer modeling", "heat treatment", "process control", "fuel efficiency", "infrared sensor", "gas flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Physical Therapists\u2019 Understanding\nof Geriatric Patient Advocacy: A Mixed Method Study\n", "id": "24826", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11074", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This project focuses on physical therapists in their role as adult educators and advocates for their geriatric patients.

Development was split into two portions: fundamental or basic concepts and components, and advanced components.  During these stages, many components, such as the transmitting and receiving probes, were fabricated, procedures were developed, and calibration of the transmitting probe was completed.\nOnce the development stages were complete, the laser Doppler velocimetry system was used to measure subsonic flows of a cold air exhaust jet.

These experiments were performed in layered Berea sandstone with a single longitudinal fracture.  The artificially created fracture was oriented perpendicular to the natural bedding of the rock for the case of spontaneous capillary imbibition.  Samples were initially vacuum saturated with the desired resident phase.  During the capillary imbibition experiment, small amounts of a wetting phase were introduced into the bottom of the fracture, allowing it to imbibe and exchange places with the resident non-wetting phase through the fracture-matrix interface.  Fluid occupancy in the fracture as well as saturation changes during the imbibition process were monitored using Micro-Computed Tomography (MCT).  Numerical simulation of various experimental scenarios was carried out.  \n\nExperimental observations combined with simulation results indicate that the fracture exhibits strong capillary behavior.  Experimental observations also show strong correspondence between fluid invasion in the matrix and variations in porosity in the matrix bedding planes.  Different porosities correspond to different permeabilities and capillary pressure curves.  Co-current and counter-current flow occur during capillary imbibition in a fractured rock.

It is well established that acid forms of zeolites are the most active in these reactions and the excellent catalytic abilities are thought to be due to the presence of Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid centers or sites in the zeolite structure.\n\tThe purpose of this study is to characterize these acid sites by using the 31P solid-state NMR of the probe molecule trimethylphosphine oxide adsorbed onto these zeolites. The 31P nucleus possesses excellent sensitivity and more importantly a large chemical shift range. This characteristic property of the 31P nucleus is essential to resolve the different acid sites in a zeolite based on their strength or \u2018proton donating ability\u2019. When a TMPO molecule is complexed to an acid site, there is a loss of electron density near the oxygen atom, which is relayed back to the 31P nucleus and is seen as a deshielding effect. The NMR resonances of the 31P nucleus are then shifted downfield and there have been suggestions in literature that this shift can be used as an indicator of acid strength.\n\tThis study undertakes to prove, through the use of double- and triple-resonance NMR techniques that the resonances seen in the 31P spectrum of TMPO complexed to acid zeolites are either due to Br\u00f8nsted or Lewis sites. The differences in structure between these two complexes are exploited to assign the acid sites. In particular since a Br\u00f8nsted site is defined by the presence of a proton, dipolar connectivity experiments such as cross-polarization and rotational echo double resonance between protons and 31P nuclei are used to verify the nature of these resonances.\n\tSince TMPO contains three methyl groups, it is critical to replace the protons with deuterium hence ensuring that the source of the 1H magnetization is from the zeolite. The deuterated version of the probe molecule, TMPO-d9 has been synthesized and used extensively to study the acid sites in two very important zeolites, HY and HZSM-5 with varying Si/Al ratios.\n\tIn HY, two types of acid sites have been resolved and identified as Br\u00f8nsted sites. One resonance in the 31P spectrum is assigned to protons associated with bridging hydroxyl groups pointing into the supercages while the other to protons in the smaller sodalite cages.\n\tIn the zeolite HZSM-5, three Br\u00f8nsted resonances have been confirmed and agree with recent reports in literature, which identify three cation positions in this zeolite. As the Si/Al ratio is increased (and the overall acid site concentration decreases), it is found that the relative amounts of the stronger acid sites increases.\n\tOn comparing the chemical shifts of the probe molecule bound to HY and HZSM-5, it also found that the resonances in HZSM-5 show a greater downfield shift. This result is in qualitative agreement with the general thinking that HZSM-5 contains stronger acid sites. The resonances of the probe molecule bound to zeolite H-&#61538; appear at positions intermediate to HY and HZSM-5 and is again consistent with literature reports that H-Beta consists of acid sites that are intermediate in strength.\n\tThe excellent resolution provided by TMPO, the high sensitivity of the 31P nucleus, the ease of the technique and most importantly the information content of the spectra makes TMPO a very useful probe for the characterization of zeolite acidity.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4025, 4026], "author_name_tesi": "Karra, Murthy Dakshina", "last_name_ssi": "Karra", "middle_name_ssi": "Dakshina", "first_name_ssi": "Murthy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James David Kubicki", "Anne M Andrews", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Alan James Benesi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James David Kubicki, Committee Member", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Chair", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zeolite", "hy", "trimethylphosphine oxide", "zsm-5", "faujasite", "acid sites", "nmr"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DELAYED COKING OF SOLVENT EXTRACTED COAL FOR PRODUCTION OF ANODE GRADE COKE: CHARACTERIZATION OF SOLID AND LIQUID PRODUCTS ", "id": "11961", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6413", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the feasibility of using high temperature solvent extraction of coal to produce feedstock for the production of anode grade coke through delayed coking.

The conversions varied from 8% to 57% (dry basis) based on mass using ash as tracer, due to issues with the filter. Multiple runs were performed in order to generate enough material for the laboratory scale delayed coking experiments. The low conversions were attributed to the high H/C ratio of the decant oil and the reactor design, particularly the filtration unit of the reactor.  Coal extraction, under conditions used in this work, proceeds through the thermal relaxation which enhances the transport properties and thermolysis, possibly, to crack enough of the coal structure in order to release the compounds of coal into the extract. Characterization of the decant oil and the coal extract was performed using simulated distillation GC and GC-MS. The coal extraction resulted in a decrease in the single- and two-ring aromatic compounds concentration and increased the concentration of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons. The concentration of the paraffins also increased slightly. Even though there was increase in the concentration of two ring compounds in the jet fuel range (boiling  point 180 oC \u2013 270 oC), there was an overall increase in the concentration of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons because the fuel oil fraction (boiling point >330 oC) was the largest fraction in the decant oil.\nCokes were produced by delayed coking in a laboratory-scale delayed coker at the EMS Energy Institute. Decant Oil was also coked for comparison purposes. A total of three coking reactions were performed. The solvent extracted liquid was coked at 470 oC and 0.273 MPa (39.7 psig), and the decant oil was coked at 465 oC and 0.253 MPa (36.8 psig). A catalytic coking run with the solvent extracted liquids was also performed at 467 oC and 0.263 MPa (38.2 psig). The catalyst used in the process is one that is typically used in fluid catalytic crackers, although no specific information about the catalyst was provided. Higher pressures (40 psig) compared to typical refinery conditions (10-25 psig) were employed to increase the yield of coke. The gasoline fraction obtained from coking of the decant oil and the coal extract was mostly paraffinic while the catalytic coking of the coal extract had a higher concentration of single-ring aromatic compounds indicating that the catalyst used aided in the formation of aromatic compounds in the liquid fractions. The jet fuel fraction also showed similar trends as the gasoline fraction. The heavier fuel fractions had an increase in the concentration of single, two-ring aromatic compounds and polyaromatic hydrocarbons while the concentration of the paraffin decreased. The extensive cracking during the delayed coking process resulted in the conversion of the paraffins into aromatic compounds (liquid and solid aromatic compounds) and light gases. It was observed that the catalyst increased the liquid yields and decreased the solid coke yield, and may have increased the rate of hydrocarbon cracking in the coker.\nThe cokes produced had low ash contents ranging from 0.54-1.01% by mass. Calcination and graphitization of the cokes at 1400 oC and 3000 oC reduced the ash contents drastically, with the ash content of the graphitized cokes less than 0.15% by mass. The cokes produced were characterized using Optical Microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO). Optical microscopic analysis of the cokes from coal extract (OTI - 14.8) were slightly less anisotropic than the coke from decant oil (OTI - 20) due to the introduction of coal derived structural elements. The green cokes generated had similar lattice parameters (interlayer spacing ~ 3.420 \u00c5, Lc ~ 27 \u00c5)   as determined by XRD indicating that the chemical composition of the feed was not altered enough to affect the graphitability. Raman spectroscopic analysis showed that the calcined cokes had a high degree of disorder (~ 45%) which decreased to less than 10% upon graphitization. TPO analysis showed that the green cokes were composed of filamentous carbon which on calcination and graphitization transformed into crystalline graphite platelets.   \nComparison of the liquids and cokes generated through co-coking of coal with decant oil showed that the solvent extraction process produces cokes of higher quality as indicated by the optical texture index (14.87 for coal extract compared to 7.1 for co-cokes), lattice parameters and ash contents (0.57% by mass for coal extract compared to 1.02% by mass for co-cokes) while the co-coking produces liquids that could potentially be more valuable (higher concentration of two-ring aromatics in liquids from co-coking)  depending on the product composition and the end use of the liquids.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6414], "author_name_tesi": "Karri, Vamsi ", "last_name_ssi": "Karri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vamsi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caroline Clifford Burgess", "Caroline Elaine Clifford"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caroline Clifford Burgess, Thesis Advisor", "Caroline Elaine Clifford, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["solvent extraction", "coprocessing", "delayed coking", "anode grade", "GC-MS", "co-coking"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PSBR CORE DESIGN STUDIES OF THE D2O TANK DESIGN \nAND NEW LEU FUEL UTILIZATION\n\n", "id": "11843", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6445", "abstract_tesi": "The Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR) is in the process of changing the core-moderator assembly of the reactor requiring a complete safety evaluation.

Theoretical models and numerical methods implemented in computer programs are utilized to analyze and design nuclear reactors. The focus of this PhD study's is the development of an advanced high-fidelity multi-physics code system to perform reactor core analysis for design and safety evaluations of research TRIGA-type reactors. \nThe fuel management and design code system TRIGSIMS was further developed to fulfill the function of a reactor design and analysis code system for the Pennsylvania State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR). TRIGSIMS, which is currently in use at the PSBR, is a fuel management tool, which incorporates the depletion code ORIGEN-S (part of SCALE system) and the Monte Carlo neutronics solver MCNP. The diffusion theory code ADMARC-H is used within TRIGSIMS to accelerate the MCNP calculations. It manages the data and fuel isotopic content and stores it for future burnup calculations.\nThe contribution of this work is the development of an improved version of TRIGSIMS, named TRIGSIMS-TH. TRIGSIMS-TH incorporates a thermal hydraulic module based on the advanced sub-channel code COBRA-TF (CTF). CTF provides the temperature feedback needed in the multi-physics calculations as well as the thermal hydraulics modeling capability of the reactor core. The temperature feedback model is using the CTF-provided local moderator and fuel temperatures for the cross-section modeling for ADMARC-H and MCNP calculations. To perform efficient critical control rod calculations, a methodology for applying a control rod position was implemented in TRIGSIMS-TH, making this code system a modeling and design tool for future core loadings.\nThe new TRIGSIMS-TH is a computer program that interlinks various other functional reactor analysis tools. It consists of the MCNP5, ADMARC-H, ORIGEN-S, and CTF. CTF was coupled with both MCNP and ADMARC-H to provide the heterogeneous temperature distribution throughout the core.  Each of these codes is written in its own computer language performing its function and outputs a set of data. TRIGSIMS-TH provides an effective use and data manipulation and transfer between different codes. With the implementation of feedback and control- rod-position modeling methodologies, the TRIGSIMS-TH calculations are more accurate and in a better agreement with measured data.\nThe PSBR is unique in many ways and there are no \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d codes, which can model this design in its entirety. In particular, PSBR has an open core design, which is cooled by natural convection. Combining several codes into a unique system brings many challenges. It also requires substantial knowledge of both operation and core design of the PSBR. This reactor is in operation decades and there is a fair amount of studies and developments in both PSBR thermal hydraulics and neutronics.  Measured data is also available for various core loadings and can be used for validation activities.  The previous studies and developments in PSBR modeling also aids as a guide to assess the findings of the work herein. \nIn order to incorporate new methods and codes into exiting TRIGSIMS, a re-evaluation of various components of the code was performed to assure the accuracy and efficiency of the existing CTF/MCNP5/ADMARC-H multi-physics coupling. A new set of ADMARC-H diffusion coefficients and cross sections was generated using the SERPENT code. This was needed as the previous data was not generated with thermal hydraulic feedback and the ARO position was used as the critical rod position. The B4C was re-evaluated for this update. The data exchange between ADMARC-H and MCNP5 was modified. The basic core model is given a flexibility to allow for various changes within the core model, and this feature was implemented in TRIGSIMS-TH. The PSBR core in the new code model can be expanded and changed. This allows the new code to be used as a modeling tool for design and analyses of future code loadings. \nThe CTF code can be used as a thermal hydraulic stand-alone modeling code. The TRIGSIMS-TH code generates and expands channel thermal hydraulic input model that is capable of analyzing the flow in and around the core construct. The tool can be used to analyze future changes such as the safety analysis of the D2O tank changes.\nThe TRIGSIMS-TH code system is an automated tool. Using a generalized input, -it will generate all the needed code-specific input files for the various applications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12193], "author_name_tesi": "Karriem, Veronica ", "last_name_ssi": "Karriem", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Veronica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["TRIGA reactor", "MCNP", "COBRA-TF", "Partially inserted control rods", "PSBR", "Thermal hydraulic and neutronic coupling methods", "CTF", "TRIGSIMS"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Development of the Method of Characteristics for Embedded Lattice Physics Calculations", "id": "16160", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8100", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Present day reactor calculation schemes are based on a multistage approach, which involves the pregeneration of nuclear data. A fundamental step in this process is the approximation of the assembly environment in the reactor, i.e. the actual assembly neutron leakage is approximated with a leakage model. Although the pregeneration approach works well for operating reactors, its applicability has been challenged with the advent of advanced Light Water reactor and High Temperature reactor designs. A practical solution to this deficiency is to use an online cross section generation approach, which entails coupling the cross section generation code (lattice physics code) to the reactor calculation code. In the online approach, the assembly leakage conditions are dynamically updated, thereby providing a better leakage approximation and therefore more representative nuclear data for the core calculation.\nA requirement for an online cross section generation scheme, is a fixed keff calculation with fixed incoming boundary conditions. This feature does not exist in many production lattice physics codes. In this work we present the development of an existing lattice physics code for use in an online cross section generation scheme. The work focuses on the Method of Characteristics (MOC) that is implemented in the HELIOS code system, developed by Studsvik Scandpower. In order to gain insight into the MOC implemented in HELIOS, two MOC transport codes were developed. A methodology was developed to extend HELIOS\u2019 capability to include a fixed keff calculation with fixed incoming boundary conditions. The testing of the implementation yielded very good results. The first outcome of this work was the determination of the details pertaining to the interface of HELIOS to other transport or diffusion codes for the purpose of leakage feedback from the core calculation to HELIOS. The second is the extension of an industry code for use in online cross section generation calculational schemes. A consequence of these developments is that an online cross section generation approach based on HELIOS can be developed on a firm basis and that such a development has the potential of near term practical application.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8042], "author_name_tesi": "Karriem, Zainuddin ", "last_name_ssi": "Karriem", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zainuddin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Seungjin Kim", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Oscar Zamonsky", "Barry Ganapol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Member", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Oscar Zamonsky, Special Member", "Barry Ganapol, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neutron Transport", "Method of Characteristics", "HELIOS", "Emebedded Lattice Calculation", "Hybrid Transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effects of Creep and Shrinkage on Time-dependent Strain and Curvature of R/C Members", "id": "12752", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The long-time deflection multiplier specified in the ACI Code is simple to use, but neglects the effects of several parameters such as age at loading and reinforcement ratio that are known to have significant effects on long-time slab deflections.

Like other polyomaviruses, such as SV40, transcription of the JCV early coding region generates a single pre-mRNA that is alternatively spliced to produce two mature transcripts that encode large T antigen (TAg) and small t antigen (tAg). Several years after this initial finding it was discovered that the JCV TAg mRNA could be alternatively spliced further to produce three additional mRNAs that encode T'135, T'136 and T'165. All five early proteins are produced during viral replication and are involved in transformation of non- permissive cells via interactions with cell cycle, apoptotic and proteosomal degradation factors. In permissive cells, the early mRNAs reach nearly equivalent levels of expression as an infection progresses. However, in non-permissive cells, the level of T'136 mRNA is observed to be higher than the levels of the T'135 and T'165 transcripts. While investigating the mechanisms regulating alternative splicing in permissive and non-permissive cells, I hypothesized that cis-acting signals and trans- acting splicing factors may regulate JCV early mRNA expression patterns. In this work, I focused upon a predicted A/C-rich exonic (ACE) motif that is similar to the motif found to influence splicing of the human CD44 gene. This ACE motif is located downstream of the T'136 acceptor splice site and is bound by the transcription and alternative splicing factor, YB-1. My results indicate, surprisingly, that the presence of the ACE motif primarily regulated the expression of T'165 mRNA and enhanced T'136 mRNA levels, but did not affect T'135 mRNA expression. Furthermore, point mutations introduced into the ACE motif increased YB-1 binding to the motif and enhanced splicing of T'136 indicative of regulation in vitro. The late JCV regulatory protein, agnoprotein, has been shown previously to interact with YB-1. My data suggested that agnoprotein may be one of the factors responsible for a shift in the early mRNA\niii\niv expression pattern that is observed between early and late phases of the infection cycle. RT-PCR\nexperiments indicated that as agnoprotein expression increased during infection, the interaction between YB-1 and agnoprotein resulted in an increase in T'165 expression. Lastly, I also identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motif downstream of the T'165 acceptor splice site, predicted to be recognized by the SR protein ASF (alternative splicing factor). I was unable to demonstrate a specific regulatory effect of ASF on the expression levels of T'165 using site-directed mutagenesis, ASF overexpression or treatment with ASF-specific inhibitory compounds. Due to the presence of an overlapping ESE recognized by a second splicing factor, SRp40, I predict that further analyses will demonstrate that SRp40 functions antagonistically toward ASF and strongly inhibits splicing at the T'165 acceptor site. Taken together, these experimental results highlight viral and cellular trans-acting splicing factors and cis-acting elements that regulate alternative splicing of the JCV early pre-mRNA.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5393], "author_name_tesi": "Kartikeyan, Ramya ", "last_name_ssi": "Kartikeyan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard John Frisque", "Richard John Frisque", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "David John Vandenbergh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard John Frisque, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Chair", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["YB-1", "Alternative splicing", "JC virus", "Agnoprotein", "ASF"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Towards Achieving Secure Content Discovery in Centralized and Decentralized Systems", "id": "9z902z84b", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12768", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A content or service selection process involves a user searching for a content or\nservice of his choice over the Internet.

In this study, the process of proving is analyzed using the constructs of resources, actions, bundles, and intentions. An individual\u2019s mathematical knowledge is cast as a network of relations between connected elements of mathematics, such as properties, objects, procedures, definitions, and theorems. These elements of mathematics can be referred to as resources to which the individual has access during the act of doing mathematics. Once individuals have called on these resources, they reason about them or perform certain actions on or with these resources. Some of these actions can be to ask a question, to construct an example, to perform a form of reasoning (e.g., inductive), or to apply a theorem. However, understanding the actions of an individual requires examining the intentions associated with the same actions (Skovsmose, 2005). Bundles are defined as subsections of the proving process that consist of groups of actions and resources that are clustered together by an identifiable intention.\n\nFive undergraduate students of mathematics and five advanced graduate students of mathematics were identically asked to validate or refute five mathematical statements. All ten participants were interviewed individually as they attempted the five tasks. The interviews were video\u2013 and audio\u2013 recorded and then were transcribed for analysis. The data was analyzed using ground theory methods of open coding, axial coding, selective coding and constant comparison.\n\nThe process of coding and constant comparison resulted in two claims related to bundles involving the generation and use of counterexamples and examples, and a third claim related to the sequencing of bundles. Both the expert and novice provers recognized the implication of finding a counterexample on the validity of the task statement. The expert provers persevered in the search for a counterexample regardless of whether they believed one exists or not. However, the novice provers did not persevere in the search for a counterexample. Both expert and novice provers used constructed examples (i.e., examples that are generated using the conditions present in the mathematical statement) as a resource that satisfy conditions present in the statement to be proved. In addition, expert provers connected the task context to a previously known illustrative example (i.e., examples that are previously known to the prover and may not be completely compatible with the conditions in the task statement). They then used the known properties of these illustrative examples to shed light on the proving process for the task at hand. Novice provers did not call upon illustrative examples. A third claim is presented related to how the expert and novice provers sequenced the bundles. Expert provers may knowingly interrupt the deductive logic in the sequencing of bundles. Novice provers were not willing to allow such interruptions.\n\nThe findings of the study show great similarity in the proving behavior of the expert provers interviewed, but also great differences when compared to the proving behavior of the novice provers.

For exponential random graph models (ERGMs) with degree sequences as sufficient statistics, we develop a privacy preserving estimator that is asymptotically consistent. For more general ERGMs where the differentially private mechanism applies a version of randomized response technique, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for inference.

To do this a new optimization approach was developed for computing the fit of a serial subtraction cognitive model to human performance data by varying architectural parameters. The new optimization approach utilizes a modified parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) on a high performance computing (HPC) cluster together with the ACT-R cognitive architecture and a serial subtraction cognitive model. Modifications to the PGA were necessary because of stochasticity embedded in the subsymbolic processes of the model\u2019s architecture. The optimization approach in this thesis was highly successful in fitting the serial subtraction model to three different levels of human data: average across subjects, challenge and threat task appraisal groups, and single-subject level performance. The optimization results revealed several interesting patterns in the parametric values found to produce best fits to the human data. Two of the patterns are supported by individual differences theories of stress and anxiety from cognitive performance research. If the field\u2019s traditional manual optimization process had been used instead, these patterns would have gone undiscovered.

I find conditions under which it is possible to identify whether actual behavior of agents is consistent with a given solution concept. I propose different applications for my general methodology. For example, I can identify whether and how often firms play Nash equilibria (NE) in an entry game, which equilibria are more likely to be selected, and whether profit functions are private information or common knowledge. I also identify whether choices are sequential or simultaneous. \nThe second essay is a logical continuation of the first one.  I focus on entry games with complete information and provide a statistical tool to test for the NE solution concept. I develop a sieve likelihood ratio type procedure to test whether the NE assumption can rationalize the data on outcomes and payoff shifters in semiparametric entry games with second-order rational firms. I allow agents to play mixed strategy NE in the regions of NE multiplicity. I do not impose parametric restrictions on the way firms randomize between different equilibria. The testing procedure does not assume that the model is point identified. I apply the proposed procedure to the data on entry and exit decisions of small grocery stores in rural areas in the USA.  \nIn the third essay I address the issue of data availability in parametric binary outcome models. In particular, I consider environments where the researcher only observes the data that correspond to a particular outcome (pure choice-based data) and has some auxiliary information about the distribution of the explanatory variables. \nI propose a Generalized Method of Moments type procedure to estimate parametric binary models with pure choice-based data when auxiliary information on distribution of explanatory variables is available.

Such a network may also employ helper nodes which may be specially designed to relay data alone or those nodes in the network that have their own data to send but have extra resources to help as relays. Energy is an important resource in a wireless ad-hoc network. Wireless routing protocols try to minimize wasteful operations so that energy is conserved wherever possible. The ability of such a routing protocol to change routes dynamically plays a big role in how efficient the protocol is. \n\nIn the protocol described here, routes change dynamically with feedback responses.

A prominent example is nitrate, which is the most energetically favorable electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen and often dominantly controls microbial reactions taking place in anoxic systems. Solid electrodes present another substrate that can regulate microbial reactions, serving as an electron donor and/or electron acceptor for microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). Electrode-mediated microbial metabolisms are central in bioelectrochemical systems (BESs), an emerging technology with a variety of potential applications, including a novel experimental platform to study the dynamic change of microbial metabolisms with real-time monitoring under controlled conditions. A better characterization of microbial reactions associated with such key substrates has important implications to understand microbial reactions in anoxic environments and also developing biological processes that exploit relevant microbial metabolisms. This research investigated the capabilities and constraints of microbial metabolisms at the nexus of electrode- and nitrate-mediated respirations relevant to wastewater treatment processes.\nThe facultative metabolic shift between anode electrode reduction and nitrate reduction was investigated in anode-reducing biofilms to study the effects of alternative metabolic options on exoelectrogenic biofilms in BESs. This has important implications not only to explain the fundamental ecology and performance of these systems, but also to develop reliable integrated nutrient removal strategies in BESs, which potentially involve nitrate that can support/induce alternative metabolisms. Using the exoelectrogenic nitrate reducer Geobacter metallireducens, the critical conditions controlling those alternative metabolisms were investigated in two-chamber, potentiostatically controlled BESs at various anode potentials, biofilm thicknesses, and nitrate concentrations. Results showed that anode-reducing biofilms preferentially reduced nitrate at all tested anode potentials (-150 to + 900 mV vs Standard Hydrogen Electrode) with a rapid metabolic shift, despite the fact that the biofilms had no prior nitrate exposure. The critical nitrate concentration that triggered a significant decrease in BES performance was a function of anode biofilm thickness but not anode potential. This indicates that these alternative metabolisms were controlled by the availability of nitrate, which is a function of nitrate concentration in the bulk solution and its diffusion into an anode-reducing biofilm. Coulombic recovery decreased as a function of nitrate dose due to electron-acceptor substrate competition, and nitrate-induced suspended biomass growth decreased the effluent quality.\nThis nitrate-induced metabolic shift of anode-reducing biofilms was further investigated in the context of a shift between two different electrode-mediated metabolisms, electrode reduction and electrode oxidation. The characterization of metabolic shifts among different electrode-mediated reactions such as anode reduction and cathode oxidation is important to understand EETs in natural settings and also to develop stable BESs. This part of the research investigated the capability of anodically-grown G. metallireducens biofilms to shift from anode reduction to cathode oxidation. In tests with potentiostatically controlled graphite electrodes, G. metallireducens biofilms demonstrated a quick and alternative shift between anode reduction and cathode oxidation as a function of electrode potential and availability of the co-substrates nitrate and acetate. Cathodic electrode oxidation was coupled with nitrate reduction by metabolically active biofilms with a large cathodic current of ~ 3.68 A/m2. This metabolic shift from anode reduction to nitrate reduction took place quicker than the metabolic shift from ferric reduction to nitrate reduction. The presence of nitrate-reducing enzyme in the anode-reducing biofilms cells in the absence of nitrate, measured as specific in-vitro nitrate-reducing enzyme activity, was thought to enable such a quick metabolic shift to start nitrate reduction. Cyclic voltammetry and the analysis of its first derivative provided insights into the electron transfer mechanisms of these biofilms.\nFinally, the potential occurrence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), a microbial nitrate-reducing metabolism that involves the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite and then nitrite to ammonium, was investigated in two full-scale wastewater treatment plants. DNRA in biological wastewater treatment systems and BESs is largely unstudied despite its potential impacts on system performance. This part of the research examined differential expression and diversity of nrfA, a key marker gene for DNRA, in activated sludge from full-scale domestic wastewater treatment plants with one designed for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). Expression of nrfA, which encodes the penta-heme nitrite reductase NrfA catalyzing the nitrite ammonification step of DNRA, was observed in anaerobic and anoxic mixed liquor, but not in aerobic mixed liquor samples. The expression of nrfA under anaerobic and anoxic conditions suggests an overlooked potential for DNRA activity to occur in biological wastewater treatment systems. Some retrieved nrfA sequences were related to sequences associated with a microbial community with anammox activity, and the nrfA diversity in this wastewater treatment system differed from that observed in soil systems. Retrieved nrfA sequences both in genomic DNA and transcript samples were dominated by sequences associated with Actinobacteria, which are often abundant in EBPR processes. These results suggested potential occurrence of DNRA in wastewater activated sludge and encourage further studies in different types of wastewater treatment systems and with chemical tracer analyses to obtain comprehensive understanding of DNRA in this context.\nThis research investigated dissimilatory nitrate reduction in electrode-respiring biofilms and full-scale wastewater treatment processes. Elucidating the dynamics of nitrate-dependent reactions of electrode-respiring G. metallireducens in the contexts of a competitive reaction to anode reduction and an alternative electrode-mediated reaction have implications for BES development. Moreover, the experimental frameworks that were developed to address those problems would be applicable to study other electrode-mediated microbial metabolisms. Findings of nrfA expression and its diversity in full-scale wastewater treatment processes indicated potential occurrences of DNRA in wastewater treatment processes, which would have implications for energy and chemical utilization in these systems, and broadened the representation of diversity in the rather limited nrfA database.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11870], "author_name_tesi": "Kashima, Hiroyuki ", "last_name_ssi": "Kashima", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hiroyuki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Ming Tien", "Christopher Aaron Gorski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Christopher Aaron Gorski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bioelectrochemical system", "Nitrate reduction", "Geobacter", "nrfA", "Wastewater treatment", "Biofilm"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Case Study to Examine Institutional Factors Facilitating and Inhibiting Faculty Preparation for Teaching in an Online MBA Program", "id": "21462", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9590", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine institutional facilitating and inhibiting factors that enabled and constrained faculty preparation for teaching in an online MBA program.

This is the counting version of the subgraph isomorphism problem and is #P-complete. We present the first general subcase of this problem which is almost always efficiently approximable.  The template families for which we almost always obtain an efficient approximation algorithm (formally captured by the notion of a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme) include graphs of degree at most two, bounded-degree forests, bounded-width grid  graphs, subdivisions of bounded-degree graphs,  and major subclasses of outerplanar graphs, series-parallel and planar graphs. As a simple consequence, we also obtain a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for counting all cycles in a random graph (solving an open problem of Frieze and McDiarmid). We also provide a general technique which can easily be applied to proving many more similar results. We then investigate the famous #P-complete problem of counting perfect matchings in a graph. For this problem, we present a simple randomized algorithm. The algorithm runs in time almost linear in the size of the input adjacency matrix and is a randomized approximation scheme for almost all graphs. This algorithm is faster than the previous best algorithm of Chien by a factor on n (number of vertices in the graph).\n\nIn the second part of this thesis, we present algorithms for constructing approximate sparse representations of geometric intersection graphs. Given a collection of geometric objects, their intersection graph is an undirected graph that has one vertex per object, and connects two objects by an edge whenever the intersection of the two objects is nonempty. A disk graph is an intersection graph of a set of disks with arbitrary radii in the plane (the generalization to higher dimensions is known as a ball graph). We present the first algorithm for constructing sparse (1+epsilon)-spanners for ball graphs. The algorithm takes sub-quadratic time. For the special case where all the balls have the same radius, we show that the spanner construction has complexity almost equivalent  to the construction of a Euclidean minimum spanning tree. We also present efficient algorithms for answering approximate distance queries in ball graphs. Disk graphs have been widely used to model wireless ad hoc networks. Spanners and distance queries are used for topology control and routing in these networks. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5731], "author_name_tesi": "Kasiviswanathan, Shiva Prasad", "last_name_ssi": "Kasiviswanathan", "middle_name_ssi": "Prasad", "first_name_ssi": "Shiva", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Furer", "Piotr Berman", "Woodrow Dale Brownawell", "Sofya Raskhodnikova", "Adam Davison Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Furer, Committee Chair", "Piotr Berman, Committee Member", "Woodrow Dale Brownawell, Committee Member", "Sofya Raskhodnikova, Committee Member", "Adam Davison Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geometric Disk Graph", "Perfect Matching", "Subgraph Isomorphism", "Approximation Algorithm", "Graph theory", "Graph Spanner"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Planning Procedure for the Identification and Development of Owner Information Exchange Requirements for Capital Facility Projects", "id": "19946", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9010", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The implementation of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has enabled the processes to effectively and collaboratively develop, manage, and support capital facility projects. However, project teams are still challenged with interoperability issues between software packages, incompatible information exchanges, and a lack of owner-developed requirements for integration into their facility management (FM) systems. Through initial research, it was determined that very few owners have defined their actual needs and how this information can be leveraged in their management systems, the level of detail necessary to maintain information efficiency, and how data developed during the project can be integrated into their facility management systems. By defining these requirements internally through a structured procedure prior to project conception, stakeholders will have the opportunity to streamline the information exchange process during design and construction into the operations of a facility.\n\nThe focus of this study was to develop a planning procedure for institutional owner organizations to determine appropriate facility requirements for construction projects and integrate BIM into their chosen facility management system. The planning procedure can lay a foundation for creating a structured process for identifying, defining, and managing data needs for all phases of the facility lifecycle.  \n\nQualitative research techniques were employed for this research. To develop this procedure, it was necessary to examine the current state of the industry and existing owner initiatives. Concurrent with this focused literature review; a participant as observer case study and a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted to develop the finalized planning procedure. \n\nThe resulting contribution of this research is a planning procedure that can assist an owner organization in determining appropriate facility information requirements for capital facility projects and integrate BIM data into their computerized facility management system. The developed procedure defines a method for identifying, defining, and managing data needs for all phases of the facility lifecycle. This protocol is suitable for both facility owners and project teams to use as an initiating step towards facility information planning and to develop the procedure to suit the specific project information needs and owner operational requirements.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8845], "author_name_tesi": "Kasprzak, Colleen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Kasprzak", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building Information Modeling (BIM)", "Owner", "Facility Management", "Processes", "Systems Engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Managing Population and Drought Risks Using Many-Objective Water Portfolio Planning Under Uncertainty\n", "id": "9610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2974", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study contributes a many-objective analysis of the tradeoffs associated with using the portfolio planning approach for managing the urban water supply risks posed by growing population demands and droughts. The analysis focuses on four supply portfolio strategies: (1) portfolios with permanent rights to reservoir inflows, (2) adaptive options contracts added to the permanent rights, (3) rights, options, and leases, and (4) rights, options, and leases subject to a critical reliability constraint used to represent a maximally risk averse case.

In summary, this thesis contributes a framework that couples interactive visualization and many-objective optimization to innovate urban water portfolio planning under uncertainty.

In the past, water resources planning has been done using single-objective benefit-cost analysis, where a single estimate of a project's costs and benefits is calculated to select funded projects.  The calculation of monetary benefit functions, however, is heavily dependent on several critical assumptions.  For example, the analysis must assume that the preferences of diverse stakeholder groups will not change in the future system states.  Moreover, operational design and implementation of engineered water resources systems must consider a broad suite of risk-based performance objectives.  This dissertation research advances water resources planning and decision support techniques that can confront the limiting challenges associated with classical approaches.  We specifically advance a many objective approach using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that allows planners to generate and evaluate planning alternatives that can balance diverse planning goals and objectives.\n\nThis dissertation contributes two new many objective planning frameworks, collections of techniques that use many objective analysis to further our understanding of how to improve planning under uncertainty.  The first framework, termed de Novo Planning, incorporates the concept of learning into many objective planning formulations.  De Novo Planning addresses the fact that planning formulations themselves change as decision makers solve problems and analyze results.  Global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' variance decomposition is used to determine an appropriate level of complexity for decision variables in the system. Multiple problem formulations are then constructed and solved using a MOEA to test the insights learned through the sensitivity analysis.\n\nThe second planning innovation is termed Many Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM).  MORDM addresses deep uncertainty, a situation in which stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on the full suite of risks that are posed to their system.  Deep uncertainty can severely impact the expected performance of planning alternatives in ways that are difficult to predict.  This issue is especially relevant since most system planning under uncertainty is evaluated using a single best estimate of the distributions of data.  Estimates from historical system information and their associated likelihoods, though, could be incorrect.  For example, climate change can alter the magnitude and timing of streamflow availability, which makes the historical data an unreliable indicator of future events.\tRobust Decision Making (RDM) has been advocated as a way to address this issue, by evaluating a wide array of plausible futures to show future system vulnerabilities.  The MORDM framework introduced in this thesis bridges many objective analysis with RDM, by evaluating solutions in the many objective tradeoff with an ensemble of alternative futures that investigate key assumptions and uncertainties, quantifying the solutions' robustness, and facilitating choice of robust solutions for a final negotiated decision.\n\nThe dissertation's planning innovations are demonstrated using two test cases with differing hydrologic characteristics and regulatory structures.  The first test case explores how to improve the supply reliability of a single city in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of Texas.  The LRGV case study uses risk-based planning triggers to control a city's use of a water market, with transfers between agricultural use and municipal supply.  The goal is to highlight how non-structural adaptation such as water marketing can aid water management in the arid western U.S.  Problems of water availability are also becoming more apparent in the eastern U.S., where water planning was traditionally focused on flood management and droughts were not often considered a serious issue.  The second test case explores multi-sector long-term supply planning for the Lower Susquehanna portion of the Susquehanna River Basin  in Pennsylvania and Maryland.  Two many objective problem formulations for the Lower Susquehanna expose biases and challenges of classical planning formulations.  Subsequent exploration of deep uncertainty suggests critical modeling assumptions for the test case.

Furthermore these investigations sought to provide answers to fundamental questions regarding the biology of Ailanthus such as maximum age at which seed production occurs and maximum lifespan, both of which ultimately affect the management of the species. Second, I carried out a series of multi-year experiments to better understand two separate aspects of Verticillium wilt of Ailanthus: efficacy of Verticillium nonalfalfae as a biocontrol agent against the target host, and intra-specific resistance that may be present within established populations in the U.S. that ultimately would affect large scale use of this potential bioncotrol. Host range studies sought to clarify and expand preliminary host-range testing, and also test whether V. nonalfalfae isolate VnAa140 was host-adapted. Finally, I sought to investigate the role of the unbiquitous exotic ambrosia beetle, Euwallacea validus, which attacks declining Ailanthus trees throughout the study area.

TonB is the dynamic central protein in this system, responding to energy from the proton motive force (pmf) at the cytoplasmic membrane and transducing that energy to outer membrane for transport through the TonB-gated transporters (TGTs) which bind the iron-siderophores.  Determining how this protein achieves that has proven to be a difficult task with several discrepancies between the in vivo and in vitro data.  TonB possesses two functional domains: an N-terminal \u00e1-helix which is required for cytoplasmic membrane association and receiving energy; and a semi-structured carboxy-terminal domain which responds to energization, interacts with the TGTs, and transduces the necessary energy for transport.  This study shows that the only residue in the N-terminal helix to provide an important side-chain is the histidine at position 20.  The Q160 region in the carboxy-terminus is known to interact directly with the TGTs and although the arginines at positions 158 and 166 have been proposed to form contacts essential for function, neither shows a significant loss of activity when substituted by alanine.  In fact very few residues exhibit any loss of activity when substituted by cysteines and none are completely inactive.  The ones that do have phenotypes are the aromatic residues, the Q160 region from positions 161-164, and the glycine at position 186.  This glycine, as well as a phenylalanine at position 125 form strong disulfide linked dimers when substituted by cysteines as seen previously for the aromatic amino acids at positions 202, 213, 215, and 230.  These data suggest that TonB is a protein that functions largely through the conformational changes is its backbone as opposed to having a few catalytically important side-chains.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3310], "author_name_tesi": "Kastead, Kyle A", "last_name_ssi": "Kastead", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["TonB"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Information Fusion of Multiple Genomic Sensors for Clustering and Cis-Regulatory Element Identification\n\n", "id": "6910", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3071", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of computational techniques for analyzing genomic data has seen rapid growth in recent years, especially with the advent of high-throughput technologies and availability of genome-wide DNA sequences. Co-regulated genes are often involved in similar cellular and biological processes, controlled by common regulators. Genes with similar patterns of expression often exhibit similar regulatory behavior. Further, control sequences corresponding to common regulators may be identified within non-coding DNA sequences of co-expressed genes. Clustering techniques may be used to identify cohorts of genes with similar expression patterns. The results of a clustering algorithm and the quality of the clusters are largely dependent on the choice of distance measure used to calculate similarity. A novel clustering algorithm, which uses Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence to estimate gene similarity, is presented. The KL Clustering algorithm has been applied successfully to Heart Rate Variability data. Due to systematic and experimental variations, gene expression measurements are often noisy. Individual expression profiles are modeled as Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF) to address this problem. A new approximation method to evaluate KL divergence for GRBFs is introduced. Microarray data alone are limited in their power to identify co-regulated genes. A Combined Clustering algorithm that is capable of incorporating diverse sources of information simultaneously is\npresented.\nTranscriptional regulation is mediated by the interaction between transcription factors and their DNA binding sites, represented by short sequences usually present near the promoter regions of genes. Co-regulated genes often have one or more regulators in common. A search for common sequence patterns within DNA sequences of clustered genes can be used to identify transcription factor binding sites (regulatory elements or motifs). A novel method to identify regulatory elements that discriminate between prespecified gene clusters is presented. The algorithm, based on the Na\u00efve Bayes technique, uses a string-based model to represent motifs. Since the motifs are discriminative, the need for background distributions is completely eliminated. The method is capable of integrating diverse data sources such as gene expression data, sequence data and phylogenetic information (e.g. sequence conservation across species). An evaluation of the identified motifs on mouse genes indicates that comparative genomics significantly improves the quality of the predictions. A new interactive motif visualization tool MotifTreeViz is presented.\nPreliminary results on several real data sets indicate that this suite of algorithms produce results that are biologically significant. All the algorithms are designed to be scalable. The software is made publicly available via a web user interface at http://biogeowarehouse.cse.psu.edu.

In addition, most histories tell us that those women who did make the front pages worked either as \u201cstunt girls,\u201d performing daring feats and then writing about their exploits to shock or titillate readers, or as \u201csob sisters,\u201d covering trials in maudlin prose intended to bring readers to tears.  However, a significant number of women broke those barriers during the Prohibition era, especially in Chicago, where the Tribune, in particular, gave women journalists wide latitude to pursue beats traditionally considered more suitable for men in that period.  The female Tribune journalists whose work is examined in this dissertation are Genevieve Forbes Herrick, whose byline was a fixture on the paper\u2019s front page throughout the Roaring Twenties; Maurine Watkins, who drew upon her work as a crime reporter to write the enduring social satire Chicago; Kathleen McLaughlin, a confidante of mobsters whose crime reportage in Chicago earned her a coveted spot in The New York Times\u2019s once exclusively male newsroom; Leola Allard, who covered Chicago\u2019s juvenile and domestic courts, reporting on crimes ranging from spousal abuse to kidnapping; and Maureen McKernan, whose clear- thinking, no-nonsense coverage of crime for the Tribune began to move closer to the modern ideal of objective, factual reporting.\nThis dissertation also explores factors that allowed for the emergence of the mob sisters, including the explosion of gangland crime \u2013 and murders by women \u2013 in Chicago during Prohibition; the increasing professionalization of journalism during the 1920s; a female-friendly culture at the Tribune; and the intersections of crime, celebrity and entertainment during the Jazz Age, all of which helped to create a window of opportunity for these women to not only cover crime, but to develop a new acerbic, witty, anti-sob-sister voice that reflected the changing attitudes of a city whose residents were concerned \u2013 yet proud of and even amused by \u2013 the chaos around them.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9095], "author_name_tesi": "Kaszuba, Beth Fantaskey", "last_name_ssi": "Kaszuba", "middle_name_ssi": "Fantaskey", "first_name_ssi": "Beth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ford Risley", "James Ford Risley", "Ann Marie Major", "Russell Frank", "Marie Hardin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ford Risley, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ford Risley, Committee Chair", "Ann Marie Major, Committee Member", "Russell Frank, Committee Member", "Marie Hardin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mob sister", "sob sister", "Chicago Tribune", "crime", "journalism"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "THEY ARE WOMEN, HEAR THEM ROAR: FEMALE SPORTSWRITERS OF THE ROARING TWENTIES", "id": "6174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Contrary to the impression conveyed by many scholars and members of the popular press, women\u2019s participation in the field of sports journalism is not a new or relatively recent phenomenon. Rather, the widespread emergence of female sports reporters can be traced to the 1920s, when gender-based notions about employment and physicality changed substantially. Those changes, together with a growing leisure class that demanded expanded newspaper coverage of athletic heroes, allowed as many as thirty-five female journalists to make inroads as sports reporters at major metropolitan newspapers during the 1920s. Among these reporters were the New York Herald Tribune\u2019s Margaret Goss, one of several newspaperwomen whose writing focused on female athletes; the Minneapolis Tribune\u2019s Lorena Hickok, whose coverage of a male sports team distinguished her from virtually all of her female sports writing peers; and the New York Telegram\u2019s Jane Dixon, whose reports on boxing and other sports from a so-called \u201cwoman\u2019s angle\u201d were representative of the way most women cracked the male-dominated field of sports journalism.  \nWhile the careers of these three women exemplify the different types of sports reporting practiced by female journalists of the period, they also highlight the overall mood and tensions of the era.  In particular, their writing illustrates the ways in which female sports journalists simultaneously accepted and challenged social and professional norms of the period.  Goss, for example, earned a regularly appearing column in the sports section \u2013 a ground-breaking accomplishment for any female sportswriter at the time \u2013 but was restricted to covering female athletes.  Hickok and Dixon, in contrast, were able to cover male athletes but were limited in other ways: Hickok\u2019s stories were typically confined to the news pages rather than being allowed in the sports section, whereas Dixon was steadily instructed to tailor her stories to the supposedly unique and superficial interests of female sports fans.\nIn sum, the work of these three women sheds light on the opportunities and obstacles that female sportswriters faced in the 1920s \u2013 and in the process provides a lens for understanding the wider gender and equality issues that underlay women\u2019s lives during the Jazz Age.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1342], "author_name_tesi": "Kaszuba, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Kaszuba", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ford Risley", "Patrick Robert Parsons", "Russell Frank", "Adam W Rome"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ford Risley, Committee Chair", "Patrick Robert Parsons, Committee Member", "Russell Frank, Committee Member", "Adam W Rome, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["women sportswriters", "female sportswriters", "women and sports journalism", "women and sports media"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Identification Of The Microbial Factors Contributing To Super-shedding Amongst Isolates Of Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli O157:H7", "id": "28777", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12419", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157) are considered as zoonotic foodborne pathogens of major public health concern that cause considerable intestinal and extra-intestinal illnesses in humans. Asymptomatic cattle are the primary reservoir of O157 that are localized in the recto-anal junction (RAJ) of colonized animals and shed in the feces and into the environment. \nA small subset of cattle, termed supershedders (SS), shed O157 at a rate that is several orders of magnitude (\u2265 104 CFU/g of feces) greater than other colonized cattle. Recent studies suggest that SS cattle play a major role in the prevalence and transmission of O157, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms associated with super-shedding.\n\nTo understand microbial factors contributing to supershedding, we sequenced two supershedder O157 isolates, SS17 (GenBank accession no. CP008805) and SS52 (GenBank accession no. CP010304). Comparative genomics analyses identified several polymorphisms in SS17 and SS52 as compared with other previously characterized O157 strains (EC4115, EDL933, Sakai, TW14359), including in a key adherence- and virulence-related loci. Whole genome alignments revealed that both SS strains cluster closely with the lineage I/II spinach outbreak isolates (EC4115 and TW14359) as compared with lineage I outbreak isolates (Sakai and EDL933) or bovine lineage II isolates. Phenotypic analyses revealed a distinctive and strong aggregative locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE)-independent adherence phenotype of wild type SS strains on bovine RAJ stratified squamous epithelial (RSE) cells that was conserved amongst other SS isolates. \nTo determine the role of the major fimbrial genes on the adherence of SS strains to host cells, a series of deletion mutants targeting the type 1 fimbriae  (fim) and Long Polar Fimbriae (lpf) 1 and 2 operons were constructed in SS strains and EDL933, and the adherence phenotype was evaluated on bovine RSE and human HEp-2 cells. The results provide strong evidence that all three fimbrial operons play a role in the adherence phenotypes of SS strains to bovine RSE and human HEp-2 cells.  For instance, the results show that the strain \u0394fimHSS17 showed a decrease in the adherence phenotype (from strong aggregative to moderate diffuse) on bovine RSE cells, while the same mutant strain became non-adherent on human HEp-2 cells. In contrast, no change in phenotype was noted with the \u0394fimHSS52 and \u0394fimHSS77 strains on either RSE or HEp-2 cells. The deletion of the entire fim operon resulted in a decrease in adherence in the SS77 strain on the RSE cells (from strong aggregative to moderate diffuse), yet no change in adherence phenotype in either the SS17 or SS52 strains was observed.\nStrikingly, \u0394lpf1 mutants of both tested SS strains (SS17 and SS52) on RSE cells and HEp-2 cells, show a decrease in adherence, suggesting that the lpf1 operon may play a major role in expression of the O157 adherence phenotype to both bovine and human cells.  Further, \u0394lpf1, \u0394lpf2, double (lpf1/ and lpf2) and triple (fim, lpf1 and lpf2) knockouts in SS isolates and EDL933 provide compelling evidence for a strain and host-cell type dependent role of the fim, lpf1, and lpf2 operons in the adherence phenotype of SS strains of O157 that is likely to be tightly regulated along with other O157 adherence factors.\n\nOur comparative genomics and molecular genetic investigations provide key insights on the genomic structure and genetic heterogeneity amongst SS strains of O157, have led to the discovery of a novel adherence phenotype of SS strains to bovine origin RSE cells, provide evidence for a previously un-described role of the fim, lpf1, and lpf2 operons in mediating adherence of SS and other O157 strains to mammalian cells, and highlight opportunities for future investigations into the regulation of adherence in SS strains and the development of potential immunotherapeutic strategies to control O157 super-shedding in cattle, and thereby reduce the risk of transmission, food contamination, and human infection of this major pathogen. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11784], "author_name_tesi": "Katani, Robab ", "last_name_ssi": "Katani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Robab", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vivek Kapur", "Chitrita Debroy", "Chitrita Debroy", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vivek Kapur, Dissertation Advisor", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Chair", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Member", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shiga Toxin-producing Escherichia Coli O157:H7", "supershedding", "microbial factors", "adherence", "fimbrial genes", "comparative genomic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Up in the air: Using blogs to study the identity and emotion transitions of the unemployed.", "id": "16248", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8259", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The 2008 economic crisis led to massive job loss, motivating many of the recently unemployed to evaluate their work-related identity.

One central problem in the domain of document networks is that of link prediction among any two documents or document centric entities, such as authors, based upon already present links in a given network. The problem of link prediction in document networks is a fundamental problem. Several applications, such as recovering missing link among entities in a given network of documents, citation recommendation to research professionals, collaborator recommendations to authors, discovering influential authors or bloggers in research articles or web-logs respectively, studying ideas and opinion propagation in evolving collection of research documents or news media, disambiguating references of people mentioned in news articles, etc. can be cast as a particular flavour of link\nprediction problem to be solved. This thesis studies following three link prediction\nbased research problems in document networks: (i)Who influences other\u2019s actions\nin a collaborative research environment?, (ii)which documents get cited by a document that joins a citation network?, and (iii) which is the correct entity for an\nentity mention in free text?.\nAmong various computation methods to solve domain specific link prediction\nproblem, statistical machine learning based techniques are an increasingly accept-\nable method due to their capability of modeling complex relationships among documents and document centric entities and dedicated efforts from research community to make the resulting intractable inference computationally scalable.

Insulin resistance is implicated in the pathology of both metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome, and both conditions are associated with elevated levels of cardiovascular disease risk factors.  Given the similar etiology of metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome, whole grains and high fiber foods have been recommended for both conditions because they lower the glycemic response and improve insulin sensitivity.  However, there is limited evidence from clinical trials as to the effectiveness of whole grains and high-fiber foods in the dietary treatment of these conditions.  The purpose of the two clinical trials I conducted was to determine if including whole grains and high fiber foods in the diet reduces cardiovascular disease risk in metabolic syndrome, and lowers testosterone levels in polycystic ovary syndrome.  \n\nIn the first study, obese men and women (25M, 25F) with metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive dietary advice to either avoid whole grain foods or to have all of their grain servings from whole grains for 12 weeks.  All other dietary advice to  achieve weight loss was the same for both groups.  A fasting blood draw, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), dual energy x-ray absorptiometery (DXA) scan, and biometric measurements were done at the beginning and end of the 12-week diet period.   \n\nBody weight decreased 3.7 \u00b1 3.5 kg or 3.5% in the whole grain group (P<0.001) and 5.3 \u00b1 5.2 kg or 4.8% in the refined grain group (P<0.001) (n.s. between groups).  Waist circumference and body fat percentage also decreased in both groups from baseline (P<0.02).  Despite a similar decrease in body weight, CRP levels decreased 38% in the whole grain group, but were unchanged in the refined grain group (P=0.007 between groups).  There were no other significant differences between groups with respect to  changes in biometric measurements, lipids and lipoproteins, glucose tolerance, markers of inflammation and fibrinolysis, and sex hormones.  Participants in the whole grain group but not the refined grain group increased their intake of dietary fiber and magnesium, and decreased their intake of saturated fat compared with baseline (P<0.05).  Participants in both groups reported a greater overall satisfaction with their diet compared with baseline (P < 0.001), rated a greater sense of having a healthy lifestyle (P < 0.001), and considered their families to be more approving of their diet (P < 0.001).  In addition, participants in the refined grain group had a lower preoccupation with food compared with baseline (P = 0.002) and participants in the whole grain group rated their meal planning and preparation as more difficult (P = 0.006).      \n\nThe aim of the second study was to determine if varying meal composition affects postprandial testosterone levels in women with PCOS.  I evaluated changes in testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), glucose, and insulin levels following a high-fat, Western meal (62% fat, 24% carbohydrate, 1g fiber) and a low-fat, high-fiber meal (6% fat, 81% carbohydrate, 27g fiber) in 15 women with PCOS using a randomized, 2x2 crossover design with a 7-day washout period.  Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 30 minutes and every hour after each meal for six hours.   \n\nTestosterone levels decreased 27% within two hours after both meals (P<0.001).  However, the testosterone level and the free androgen index remained below pre-meal values for four hours after the low-fat, high-fiber meal (P <0.004) and for six hours after the high-fat, Western meal (P <0.004).  Insulin levels were almost 2 fold higher at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the low-fat, high-fiber meal compared with the high fat, Western meal (P <0.03).  Glucose levels also were higher at 30 and 60 minutes after the low-fat, high-fiber meal compared with the high-fat, Western meal (P<0.003).\n\nThe findings from these two studies demonstrate that whole grains and high fiber foods have metabolic and reproductive effects in metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome.  The results from the first study demonstrate that weight loss can be achieved with a diet high in whole grains, similar to a conventional hypocaloric diet with refined grains, but there may be additional benefits to the cardiovascular risk profile.  Specifically, I observed a reduction in c-reactive protein, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in participants consuming whole grains but not refined grains.  \nThe finding of a prolonged reduction in postprandial testosterone levels following a high-fat, Western meal compared with a low-fat, high-fiber meal indicates that diet plays a role in the regulation of testosterone levels in women with PCOS, and that diet composition may be an important consideration in the treatment of hyperandrogenism in PCOS.  Future studies examining larger cohorts for longer periods are necessary to determine the long-term health benefits of whole grains and high-fiber foods in metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome.  \n\n \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2256], "author_name_tesi": "Katcher, Heather Ilene", "last_name_ssi": "Katcher", "middle_name_ssi": "Ilene", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Richard Scott Legro", "Michael Henry Green", "Peter J Gillies", "Ian Alexander Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Richard Scott Legro, Committee Chair", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member", "Peter J Gillies, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metabolic syndrome", "weight loss", "whole grains", "c-reactive protein", "testosterone", "fiber", "polycystic ovary syndrome"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Optimization of Distributed Netted Sensor Fields with Application to Undersea Surveillance", "id": "11906", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4021", "abstract_tesi": "Distributed-Netted Systems (DNS) can be used in many different environments.

The literature fails to answer questions such as is mobility cost effective, how fast is fast enough, are fewer high performance sensors preferred over many less expensive lower performance sensors, etc. We introduce a novel geometric method that allows rapid analysis of competing approaches including heterogeneous mixtures of several different sensor types. Our approach will allow planners to select Pareto efficient solutions for undersea surveillance applications. Within our approach, the sensors are modeled as disks which represent their acquisition footprint. The sensor will be able to detect, classify, localize, and track (DCLT) any submerged contact that enters this region; we refer to the sensor&#8223;s ability to DCLT as \"acquiring&#8223; the contact. Submerged contacts can only enter along one side of the rectangular area, known as the border. The contacts are described in terms of their offset from one side of the region and the angle they create with the border (also referred to as the heading). Probability density functions are used to describe these offsets and headings, and their combination results in a probability mass function (PMF). A coverage function is developed to determine which of these offsets and headings are \"covered&#8223; by a sensor located at a particular point in the area. The goal of the approach is to maximize the probability of acquisition, which is calculated as the Frobenius inner product of the Hadamard product of the PMF and the coverage function.

Instead, we resort to output from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR).  The HRRR\u2019s 3-km grid spacing can resolve larger-scale topographic effects.  Widely used convective storm forecasting parameters obtained from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh model are averaged during convective days from 2013\u20132015.

The remaining variability is attributable to hemispheric-scale meridional temperature and pressure gradients along with topographical influences where meso-\u03b2-scale anomalies exist.  The anomalies, especially those related to low-level wind shear, are sensitive to low-level wind direction, which dictates where local winds blow upslope or downslope.  Tornado tracks from 1950\u20132015 are compared with anomalies within the mean fields of the convective forecasting parameters.  Several anomalies are examined with mean soundings or hodographs at points within and just outside of the anomaly of interest to investigate their dynamic or thermodynamic origins.

During the end of the last glacial period, several large freshening events were recorded in the geologic record within the Champlain Sea, indicating that large volumes of freshwater from pro-glacial lakes, such as Lake Agassiz and others in the Great Lakes Region, likely routed out into the North Atlantic.  This study utilizes a two-dimensional estuarine model of the Champlain Sea during two flood events at 11.4 and 13.0 ka BP to estimate the durations and magnitudes of these freshwater flooding events, the later being of particular note as it closely predates the Younger Dryas cooling episode.  Values of pre and post-flood paleo-salinity within the current-day Lake Champlain are used as constraints within the model to determine the amount and duration of freshwater fluxes required to cause the observed salinity changes.  Paleo-salinity during the 11.4 ka BP event changed from 25 ppt to 8 \u00b1 3 ppt, which requires flood volumes in excess of 5,500 km3 to inundate the region over timescales of less than two weeks.  The model could not reproduce the observed freshening of the Champlain Sea (25 to 0 \u00b1 3 ppt) for reasonable flood volumes, which may reflect model limitations in strongly sloping bathymetry and narrow channels, as well as uncertainties in the bathymetric reconstruction.

The second aim of this study is to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using a group version of the Trier Social Stress Test (GPST-A), a social-evaluative stressor, in a school-based setting.

Results from a discontinuous multilevel model indicate that the protocol was feasible in the school context and effective at eliciting a typical stress response.  Results also indicate that rumination, but not suppression or reappraisal, was associated with the reactivity phase of the stress response.  Specifically, trait rumination predicts a less steep cortisol reactivity slope and state rumination predicts a steeper cortisol reactivity slope.  Suppression and reappraisal had no effect on participants\u2019 cortisol response profiles.   \nThe present study provides a better understanding of affective chronometry in a group of adolescents through a unique analytic approach.

Like other tissue-specific stem cell populations, SSC initiate differentiation while also maintaining a cohort of undifferentiated stem cells via self-renewal. Decisions to self-renew or differentiate are controlled both extrinsically and intrinsically. These decisions must be tightly controlled, as dysregulation can lead to loss of tissue homeostasis, infertility or cancer. Currently, understanding of mechanisms regulating SSC fate decisions, particularly differentiation, is limited. Therefore, the goal of the studies herein was to identify and examine molecular factors required for fate decisions of SSC. Two proteins, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and Neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), were investigated. Stat3, a transcription factor, is part of the Jak/Stat signal transduction pathway. The Drosophila Stat3 homolog, Stat92E is necessary for self-renewal germline stem cells. Also, embryonic stem cells require Stat3 signaling to maintain pluripotency. Ngn3 is a transcription factor needed for the differentiation of neurons and \u0192\u00d2-cell progenitors. In the mammalian germline, expression of Ngn3 coincides with early germ cell differentiation. Furthermore, in rodents, the cytokine Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf) regulates SSC self-renewal and Ngn3 is known to be a Gdnf down-regulated gene. Despite this, to our knowledge, the functional roles of Stat3 or Ngn3 have yet to be examined in SSC fate decisions.\nIn Chapter II: Regulation of SSC differentiation by Stat3, the objective was to determine the effect of Stat3 mRNA reduction on SSC fate decisions. To address the objective, Stat3-specific shRNA was used to permanently reduce Stat3 expression in cultured Thy1+ germ cells. After functional germ cell transplantation, it was apparent that short hairpin RNA-mediated stable reduction of STAT3 expression in cultured SSCs abolished SSC ability to differentiate beyond the undifferentiated spermatogonial stage following transplantation into recipient testes. Therefore, these results demonstrate that STAT3 promotes the differentiation of SSC.\nThe objective of Chapter III: Neurogenin 3 is a regulator of mouse spermatogonial stem cell differentiation was to determine if NGN3 plays a functional role in SSC differentiation. To address this, we studied the SSC-enriched Thy1+ germ cell population, which is also composed of non-SSC spermatogonia produced by differentiation. Withdrawal and replacement of Gdnf from cultured THY1+ germ cells resulted in an increase followed by down-regulation of Ngn3 gene expression, indicating that Ngn3 transcription is repressed by GDNF signaling. Within the THY1+ germ cell population, NGN3 expression was found in a sub-fraction of cells both in vivo and after long-term culture. Transient reduction of Ngn3 expression in cultured THY1+ germ cells by siRNA treatment increased SSC content after multiple self-renewal cycles without impacting spermatogonial proliferation overall, suggesting alteration of the balance between SSC fate decisions in favor of self-renewal. Lastly, it was found that the SSC differentiation factor STAT3 binds the Ngn3 promoter to regulate Ngn3 transcription in THY1+ germ cells. Collectively, these results indicate NGN3 plays a key role in regulating differentiation of SSCs via a STAT3-mediated mechanism.\nCollectively, the data of these two studies indicate that Stat3 and Ngn3 work in conjunction to regulate SSC differentiation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [456], "author_name_tesi": "Kaucher, Amy V", "last_name_ssi": "Kaucher", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jon Oatley", "Jon M Oatley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jon Oatley, Thesis Advisor", "Jon M Oatley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["SPERMATOGONIAL STEM CELL", "SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 3", "NEUROGENIN 3", "DIFFERENTIATION"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "SOW AND PIGLET RESPONSES TO ENDOTOXIN-INDUCED MASTITIS", "id": "6287", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "47", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mastitis is a common contributing factor to the relatively high pre-weaning mortality rate and suboptimal sow-reared piglet growth performance experienced in pork production.  An endotoxin challenge model of mastitis was used to determine its effects on sow milk composition, milk yield, and the growth of nursing piglets.  Caseins (beta-casein in particular), lactoferrin, and immunoglobulins, as determined by SDS-PAGE and ELISA, were high in colostrum, and levels decreased to mature levels by about day four of a normal lactation.  As mammary secretions changed from colostrum to milk, decreasing levels of chloride and albumin provided evidence for the closure of tight junctions by about day four of a normal lactation.  Following endotoxin infusion to induce mammary inflammation, sow rectal temperatures peaked at 1.1-1.7 degrees C above baseline by five hours post-infusion, and gradually recovered within 12-24 h.  Milk TNF-alpha was increased 30-fold by five hours post-infusion (serum TNF-alpha appeared to increase); both recovered by 12 h.  Milk total protein (20 %), albumin (44 %), and chloride (two-fold) were increased, and milk alpha s- and beta-casein (45 %) were decreased post-infusion; milk protein composition was altered for at least 48-60 h.  It did not appear that lactoferrin in milk responded to intramammary endotoxin infusion.  Hourly milk yields of infused mammary glands were decreased 16-31 % relative to control glands and the ADG of piglets nursing infused glands were decreased 44-74 % relative to littermates nursing control glands on the day of endotoxin infusion.  The ADG of piglets nursing infused glands remained decreased relative to littermates nursing control glands for at least five days post-infusion.  The apparent conversion of milk to live weight gain of pigs nursing infused glands was decreased relative to those nursing control glands.  Intramammary endotoxin infusion in the sow alters milk composition and depresses piglet growth performance for at least three to five days after the resolution of clinical signs of mammary inflammation.

Masonry infill panels have beneficial thermal and acoustic insulating properties and are often used for interior partitions as well as exterior walls.  The structural properties of masonry infill walls, however, are often overlooked.  In common practice, infill walls are treated as architectural elements and their influence on the behavior of the structural frame is not considered during design.  Ignoring the contribution of masonry infill walls to the stiffness and response of building structures can lead to uneconomical design as well as unexpected behavior and even catastrophic collapse.  \n\nMasonry infill walls increase the stiffness of structural frames and help to limit building deflections under normal lateral loads such as wind and small seismic events.  Not accounting for the stiffness of infill walls in the design of infilled frames, however, can result in damage to the infill material and non-ductile frame behavior during large seismic events.  A new concept in the performance and design of masonry infill walls is the idea of a structural fuse system.  This seismic isolation system allows for composite interaction between infill walls and the structural frame under normal lateral loads.  Brittle failure of the infill walls or frame elements is prevented by the introduction of a fuse mechanism, which isolates the infill material from the frame under higher loads.  \n\nThe primary objectives of this research program were to study the behavior of the structural fuse system under cyclic loads and to evaluate the performance of the system for use with various masonry materials.  Additional objectives were to evaluate the performance of lumber disk fuse elements as a viable option for use in a fuse mechanism seismic isolation system, and to determine the shear and compressive strengths of the masonry materials used in the parametric study.   \n\nA new experimental program was developed and executed to accomplish these goals.  Cyclic tests were performed by applying simultaneous, displacement controlled loads at the first, second, and third stories of a two-bay, three-story steel test frame with brick infill walls; using a quasi-static loading protocol to create a first mode response in the structural system.  A parametric study was also completed by replacing the brick walls with infill panels constructed of other masonry materials including concrete masonry units (CMU) and autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) blocks, and applying monotonically increasing, displacement controlled loads to the test frame.  During these tests, in-plane damage was not observed in the brick, CMU, or AAC infill walls.  The results of this study showed that the lumber disk structural fuse elements worked well as seismic isolation devices.  \n\nBased on the provisions of the Masonry Standards Joint Committee, MSJC (2008), equations were developed for determining the nominal in-plane strength of infill walls constructed of various masonry materials.  The in-plane wall capacities predicted by these equations were compared to the results of destructive wall panel shear tests that were performed as part of this testing program.  A simplified macro model was developed using SAP2000, and compared to the results of the monotonic tests.  This approach was evaluated for use in the design office.  It was determined that a more rigorous analytical technique is required to successfully capture the in-plane behavior of the structural fuse system.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [226], "author_name_tesi": "Kauffman, Andrew Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Kauffman", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali M Memari"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali M Memari, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["structural fuse", "masonry infill walls", "cyclic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Vibration Reduction of Integrally Bladed Rotors Using Piezoelectric Materials", "id": "15633", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7938", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent advances in turbomachinery design have led to the use of monolithic bladed disks (blisks) for their increased overall aerodynamic efficiency and decreased drag, complexity, parts count, and weight. However, these improvements come at the cost of very low intrinsic damping, resulting in large vibratory stresses and ultimately leading to high-cycle fatigue. This research aims at the development of a technique that reduces the turbomachinery blade vibration generated when a change in rotation speed results in an excitation frequency sweeping through a structural resonance frequency. In particular, a semi-active technique termed resonance frequency detuning is developed, simulated, and experimentally demonstrated to illustrate its potential for turbomachinery blade vibration reduction.\n \nResonance frequency detuning involves altering the blade structural properties to avoid (to the extent possible) resonance excitation, thus inhibiting large vibration response. Through the inclusion of piezoelectric material in the turbomachinery blade, detuning alters the electrical boundary conditions of the piezoelectric material to change the blade stiffness. When switched optimally, this change results in a structural resonance frequency that is detuned from that of the excitation.\n\nTo achieve optimal vibration reduction, the piezoelectric material should be located in a region of high modal strain, so a significant aspect of this research is the development of an accurate low-order turbomachinery blade model, treated here as a representative flat trapezoidal plate with attached piezoelectric material. Based on the assumed modes method, the model produces a set of discretized equations of motion that may be coupled with those corresponding to piezoelectric shunt circuitry to simulate a variety of vibration reduction approaches.\n\nExperimental data validates both the low-order model and the concept of resonance frequency detuning. The model generates very good predictions of plate natural frequencies with a variety of electrical boundary conditions. It also predicts key plate modal parameters like electromechanical coupling coefficients and damping ratios with moderately good accuracy. More significantly, experimental data confirm that resonance frequency detuning can reduce the vibration associated with sweep excitation passing through resonance. Furthermore, the dynamics model can accurately predict the optimal parameters for implementation of resonance frequency detuning, as well as the expected ensuing vibration reduction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7892], "author_name_tesi": "Kauffman, Jeffrey Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Kauffman", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre", "George A Lesieutre", "Stephen Clarke Conlon", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Kirsten P Duffy", "Heath F Hofmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre, Dissertation Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Chair", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Kirsten P Duffy, Special Member", "Heath F Hofmann, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["resonance frequency detuning", "vibration reduction", "turbomachinery damping", "piezoelectric device", "rotating structures"]}]
