Multiple scattering is an important factor in treating the penetration of radiation through an optically thick medium, such as clouds and fog. A multistatic lidar system, which was developed at Pennsylvania State University, has the ability to evaluate multiple scattering effects in a dense medium by measuring the polarization ratio of the scattering phase function at different scattering angles, and by measuring the radial distributions of a transmitted laser beam. Measurements of aerosol properties as a function of scattering angle are particularly important for extracting information on the characteristics of the optical scatterers, such as particles sizes and number densities. It was known that the width of the intensity peak is inversely dependent upon the particle size, and this factor also explains multiple scattering effects along the beam path. The effects of a multiple scattering during propagation of narrow light beams in aerosols have been investigated using the two features; the radial distribution of scattered light, and the changes of polarization ratio compared to single particle scattering.\n\t\tLaboratory experiments were conducted in the Aerosol Research Chamber of the Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC) in Quebec and in a small chamber that we constructed at PSU. These chamber environments have been used to conduct scattering experiments under conditions of a better controlled laboratory environment. An outdoor field study was performed in State College during the summer of 2007. The field experiments were made under sufficiently high relative humidity conditions of light and heavy fog conditions on these nights that it is reasonable to use a spherical model to describe scattering particles. These conditions provide excellent situations to investigate multiple scattering effects.\nA theoretical investigation of multiple scattering using a Bistatic Monte Carlo (BMC) calculation method showed that multiple scattering effects increase as particle size, extinction and the penetration distance of a scattering medium increase. Multiple scattering calculations for atmospheric models having large extinction coefficients are comparable to or larger than those of single scattering. However, in case of a lower extinction coefficient, a single scattering component is always dominant in both forward and backward directions. Experimental results obtained from chamber tests revealed that even in the case when same particle distribution is considered, multiple scattering effects, associated with the density of scatterers in terms of optical depth, increase as the number density increases within the scattering volume. Specifically, multiple scattering increases depolarization of the scattered intensity as the scattering angle increases from 0&#61616; and 180&#61616;. Results of measurements of the radial distribution of a laser beam into optically dense media showed that multiple scattering effects increase with optical depth, lead to beam broadening along the beam path, and exhibit a slope in the gradient of the radial distribution of intensity that is much less than for the clear atmospheric condition. The results show good agreement with the previous calculations and measurements conducted by Bissonnette.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3199], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Jin Hyen ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jin Hyen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick", "Victor P Pasko", "Zhiwen Liu", "Anne Mee Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick, Committee Chair", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Anne Mee Thompson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiple scattering", "Multistatic lidar"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "MANIFOLD LEARNING IN COMPUTER VISION", "id": "6731", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3209", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Appearance based learning has become very popular in the field of computer vision. In a particular system, a visual datum such as an image is usually treated as a vector by concatenating each row or\n  column.  The dimension of the image vector is very high, equal to the number of pixels of the image.  When we consider a sequence of images, such video sequences or images capturing an object from different view points, it typically lies on a non-linear dimensional manifold, whose dimension is much lower than that of the original data. When we know the structure of the non-linear manifold, it can be very helpful in the field of computer vision for various applications such as imensionality reduction, noise handling, etc.\n\n  In the first part of this thesis, we propose a method for outlier handling and noise reduction using weighted local linear smoothing for a set of noisy points sampled from a nonlinear manifold.  This method can be used in conjunction with various manifold learning methods such as Isomap (Isometric Feature Map), LLE (Local Linear\n  Embedding) and LTSA (Local Tangent Space Alignment) as a preprocessing step to obtain a more accurate reconstruction of the underlying nonlinear manifolds.  Using Weighted PCA (Principal Component Analysis) as a foundation, we suggest an iterative weight selection scheme for robust local linear fitting together with an\n  outlier detection method based on minimal spanning trees to further improve robustness.  We also develop an efficient and effective bias-reduction method to deal with the ``trim the peak and fill the valley' phenomenon in local linear smoothing.  Synthetic examples along with several real image data sets are presented to show that we can combine manifold learning methods with weighted local linear smoothing to produce more accurate results. The proposed local smoothing method has been applied to the image occlusion handling problem and to the noise reduction problem for point-based rendering.\n\n  The second part of this thesis focuses on image occlusion handling utilizing manifold learning. We propose an algorithm to handle the problem of image occlusion using the Least Angle Regression (LARS) algorithm. LARS, which was proposed recently in the area of statistics, is known as a less greedy version of he traditional forward model selection algorithm. In other words, the LARS algorithm provides a family of image denoising results from one updated pixel to all of the updated pixels. Using image thresholding and the statistical model selection criterion of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we propose a method for selecting an optimal solution among the family of solutions that the LARS algorithm provides. Three sets of experiments were performed. The first measured the stability of the optimal solution estimation method. The second set showed the effects of subblock computation on\n  performance. The last set applied the occlusion handling algorithm to the noisy data cleaning problem, and compared it to two other methods: Orthogonal projection with Weighted PCA and Robust PCA. Experimental results showed that the proposed method yields better performance than the other methods.\n\n In the third part of this thesis, we propose a robust motion segmentation method using the techniques of matrix factorization, subspace separation and spectral graph partitioning.  We first show that the shape interaction matrix can be derived using QR decomposition rather than Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) which also leads to a simple proof of the shape subspace separation\n theorem.  Using the shape interaction matrix, we solve the motion segmentation problems using spectral clustering techniques. We exploit the multi-way Min-Max cut clustering method and provide a novel approach for cluster membership assignment. We further show that we can combine a cluster refinement method based on subspace separation with the graph clustering method which improves its robustness in the presence of noise. The proposed method yields very good performance\n for both synthetic and real image sequences.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3197], "author_name_tesi": "Park, JinHyeong ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "JinHyeong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rangachar Kasturi", "Hongyuan Zha", "Octavia I Camps", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rangachar Kasturi, Committee Chair", "Hongyuan Zha, Committee Chair", "Octavia I Camps, Committee Member", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["manifold", "image occlusion handling", "weighted PCA", "Least Angle Regression", "Spectral Graph Clustering", "Motion Segmentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "SHARED LEADERSHIP IN PROJECT TEAMS: A QUALITATIVE EXAMINATION OF THEORETICAL THEMES, ANTECEDENTS, AND OUTCOMES", "id": "15130pvj5055", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15130", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the individual approach to examining leadership has cast light on understanding leadership dynamics within a team, it also contains some inherent limitations because this approach only considers the relationship between single leaders and their followers. Over the last decade, scholars have begun to take collectivistic approaches to studying leadership such as shared leadership. While many leadership scholars emphasize the importance and value of shared leadership, a dearth of research exists as to what precisely constitutes shared leadership within a team context and as to why certain teams exhibit more effective shared leadership than others. \nThe primary purpose of this study was to clarify shared leadership by exploring the content and theoretical themes of shared leadership and its fundamental antecedents and outcomes. I also aimed to conceptualize and develop a model of shared leadership that can be adapted for multiple contexts by conducting the research in South Korean context. Because this study was aimed at discovering a new construct that lacks theoretical and conceptual clarity, it was appropriate to use a qualitative method.\nThrough in-depth interviews with thirty management consultants and seven non-participant observations of team meetings, this study examined theoretical themes, antecedents, and outcomes of shared leadership. The preliminary evidence showed that shared leadership includes team members\u2019 autonomously making a decision, taking a proactive initiative, engaging in extra-role behaviors, horizontally making joint decisions, and vertically making joint decisions. My investigation of situational antecedents (i.e., about formal leader traits and behaviors, team composition, and work characteristics) provides insight into the boundary conditions that nurture the proliferation of shared leadership. I also found various individual antecedents, including holding a core team evaluation, showing team trust, and creating an open communication climate, for promoting shared leadership. Finally, I discovered that shared leadership has unique short- and long-term outcomes on individuals and teams.\nI ascertained that the main contribution of this study is a model outlining what exactly shared among team members is. This study also presented a novel methodology to provide constructive insights on the shared leadership phenomenon through a comprehensive understanding of shared leadership based on a qualitative data analysis of individuals with firsthand shared leadership experience.

Decision statistic distributions are developed at both the platform and target. These distributions allow efficient Monte Carlo simulation of detection performance and comparison with a previous work\u2019s assumption of Gaussian decision statistics. We then explore the detection advantage the platform can achieve by evasive on-off keying and by optimization of its transmitted power. A favorable (evasive) operating region of the platform in the (low power, small range) region of the (range, power) plane is identified. This suggests that the platform should start detection (and range-finding) using a low-power probing signal, increasing power until a reliable detection rate is first achieved while ensuring the target\u2019s detection rate does not exceed a specified level.\nUsing a detailed waveform-based simulation framework, the second part of the feasibility study using LPI sonar signal is about covert range estimation. A frequency selective channel filter is used for a more realistic simulation. As in the first part, the platform uses matched filtering and the target uses energy detection. However, the objective of the platform is to estimate the range to the target while ensuring that the target still fails to detect the platform\u2019s pinging LPI waveform.

These models, however, lead to different representations of market structure and consumers\u2019 heterogeneity. The ideal point model, a more general case of the vector model, often suffers from degenerate solutions. Recent research\nsuggests that such ideal point degenerate solutions can be results of mixing sample of consumers that utilize different underlying utility functions.

Results suggest that ideal point segments and vector segments can be distinguished by their average prescription volume and preference variance. Vector segments exhibit higher prescription volume despite the fact that they consist of a small number of physicians than ideal point segments.

This successive emergence of new products within a product family can be considered as product family evolution, which is derived from inherent evolving properties and adaptation to dynamic product environments. Although product family design has been widely discussed, product family evolution has not been sufficiently explored in an analytical manner. To tackle this issue, this research aims to demonstrate the underlying properties of product family evolution and to model the process of product family evolution. The methodology of this research is based on a network science approach and consists of two phases: 1) characterization of product family evolution and 2) modeling of product family evolution. In the first phase, a network representation for product family architectures is devised to effectively describe relationships between components. Then, topological properties and significant network motifs in the product family network at each time period are investigated through a case study using the smartphone models of a major company. The results show that both individual product and product family networks follow the properties observed in other real networks. The network properties and significant motifs of the individual smartphone networks suggest that the individual product structure grows as a scale-free network with common building blocks. On the other hand, the smartphone product family network evolves with both scale-free and small-world properties due to commonality in a product family. Also, the product family network changes with common and specific motifs during each specific time duration. In the second phase, the complex adaptive process of product family evolution is simplified and modeled to estimate configurational changes in product family architecture design. In this model, evolution modes embedding specific variant generation mechanisms are realized through a mixed-strategy game theory and an evolving network model - fitness model. For the proposed product family evolution model, illustrative examples are introduced to describe the dynamic configuration process of a product family structure. Finally, evolutionary opportunities for product and product family design focusing on the universality of network properties are addressed from the perspectives of topological robustness and complexity. From theoretical and empirical evidences, it is identified that a design structure with scale-free network topology and commonality has topological robustness since it has less complexity in structural connectivity and variety.

Lexicogrammatical performance refers to the extent to which writers make appropriate choices of vocabulary and syntax in accordance with the expectations of discourse communities. Improving their performance in this regard presents a major challenge to L2 writers. In working to improve lexicogrammatical performance, genre-based pedagogy has focused either on raising awareness through explicit instruction or on enhancing performance through situated learning. These methods, however, have been only modestly successful. This thesis explores an alternative approach\u2014one that uses corpus technology to enhance awareness and performance simultaneously. The research develops a corpus-based system consisting of a genre- and discipline-specific corpus and a companion search engine, the effects of which are evaluated in relation to the lexicogrammatical performance of students in an undergraduate ESL composition course for the duration of one semester. Through working with this system, L2 writers meet their lexicogrammatical challenges in an effective and efficient way. Their interaction with the corpus (Learner-Corpus Interaction, LCI) is a multi-layered process comprising four structural units: consultation, transaction, exchange, and move. Through these units, students engage in intense hypotheses testing to eventually appropriate the target lexicogrammatical items from the corpus. Thus, the primary characteristic of LCI is the dialogic negotiation and collaborative construction of knowledge. The way LCI facilitates the students\u2019 development is strikingly similar to the ways in which an experienced tutor helps a student to advance through the Zone of Proximal Development. The findings suggest that the writer\u2019s composing process is fundamentally a developmental process and that corpus-based research should focus on maximizing the writer\u2019s developmental potential through collaborative construction of text. LCI raises the exciting possibility that many issues in writing pedagogy (e.g., plagiarism) can be addressed by facilitating micro-scale development through highly focused and situated interaction with a corpus. To maximize the benefits for students, the thesis suggests that a corpus system should be incorporated into, and coordinated with, the teacher\u2019s instruction and guidance. In identifying guidelines for such coordination and theoretical principles for artifact-mediated writing in this digital era, the thesis offers this conclusion: it posits distributed cognition theory as a conceptual framework for coordinating computational mediation with genre-based writing instruction in contemporary writing contexts\u2014contexts that are increasingly mediated, distributed, and collaborative.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3583], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Kwanghyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kwanghyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Celeste S Kinginger", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Karen E Johnson", "Xiaofei Lu", "Xiaoye You"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Celeste S Kinginger, Dissertation Advisor", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Xiaofei Lu, Committee Member", "Xiaoye You, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Learner-Corpus Interaction", "L2 writing", "Lexicogrammar", "Genre-based pedagogy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "development of lithium powder based anode with conductive carbon materials for lithium batteries", "id": "28028", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current lithium ion battery with a graphite anode shows stable cycle performance and safety.

Among the challenges, lithium anode\u2019s problem related to lithium dendrite growth causing internal short and low cycling efficiency is very serious. Thus, extensive research on lithium metal anode has been performed to solve the lithium dendrite problem and a major part of the research has been focused on the control of the interface between lithium and electrolyte. However, research on lithium anode design itself has not been much conducted. In this research, innovative lithium anode design for less dendrite growth and higher cycling efficiency was suggested.\nLiterature review for the lithium dendrite growth mechanism was conducted in Chapter 2 to develop electrode design concept and the importance of the current density on lithium dendrite growth was also found in the literature. The preliminary test was conducted to verify the developed electrode concept by using lithium powder based anode (LIP) with conductive carbon materials and the results showed that lithium dendrite growth could be suppressed in this electrode design due to its increased electrochemical surface area and lithium deposition sites during lithium deposition.\nThe electrode design suggested in Chapter 2 was extensively studied in Chapter 3 in terms of lithium dendrite growth morphology, lithium cycling efficiency and full cell cycling performance. This electrode concept was further developed to maximize the electrode\u2019s performance and safety in Chapter 4. In this new electrode design, electrically isolated super-p carbon agglomerates in the electrode were effectively reduced by adding conductive fillers such as graphite and further improvement in cycling performance and safety was also verified.\nThe lithium powder based anode with conductive carbon materials is very useful concept as an alternative anode design instead of pure lithium metal anode for high energy density lithium batteries such as lithium-sulfur and lithium-air. As shown in Chapter 5, this electrode concept can be further developed and optimized through the application of new carbon materials and structure.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11705], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Mansu ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mansu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Seong Han Kim", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Seong Han Kim, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lithium batteries", "lithium powder", "lithium dendrite", "lithium cycling efficiency", "Cycling performance", "Internal short"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Relationship of Change Readiness and Work Engagement in Manufacturing Organizations in South Central Pennsylvania", "id": "26824", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11909", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Successful change efforts are critical to an organization\u2019s strategy and growth and, therefore, an understanding of how to best manage these change efforts is of interest to innovative and forward-looking organizations.

As no empirical studies were found which examined this relationship, this research adds to the existing literature on both topics.\nTo explore the multiple variables and inter-relationships posed in the four research questions, a cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of manufacturing employees in south-central Pennsylvania.  Work engagement was measured via the three subscales of vigor, dedication, and absorption of the nine item Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES-9).  Organizational readiness for change was measured with the reflexivity, and innovation and flexibility subscales of the Organizational Climate Measure (OCM).  \nMethods to analyze the data included descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, and hierarchical multiple regression, factorial ANOVA, and coding of qualitative data.  The results of bivariate analyses demonstrate the moderate positive strength of the relationship for the seven study variables.  Therefore, this study provides the first empirical evidence of the importance of employee work engagement to an organization\u2019s readiness for change and adds to the existing literature on both constructs.\nResults of the hierarchical multiple regression analysis demonstrates (a) dedication was the only work engagement variable with a significant influence in explaining differences in the change readiness scores of innovation and flexibility, and (b) dedication and absorption had very similar influences in explaining score differences in reflexivity.  The importance of the employee\u2019s dedication on an organization\u2019s readiness for change strengthened the significance of the moderate to strong correlation measured between dedication and overall RFC.\nFinally, three methods were used, including factorial ANOVA, to investigate the influence of position and years in the organization on overall EWE, overall RFC, and the subscales of each construct.

In the present  study,  initial-value calculations are performed with the dynamical core of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration/Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory climate model to examine whether the difference in the eddy energy between the WB and SB life cycles can be explained in terms of the stabilizing effect of the horizontal zonal wind shear in the background state. Consistent with observations, the idealized life cycle calculations show that a greater maximum eddy energy is attained for the WB basic state than for the SB basic state, suggesting that the horizontal zonal wind shear indeed plays the dominant role in determining the eddy amplitude.  In addition, the WB life cycle produces a more pronounced poleward jet shift. Because warmer climates simulated by climate models tend to show both a poleward jet shift and more intense zonally localized tropical convection that , according to Moon and Feldstein (2009), prefers the WB state, our result suggests that the poleward jet shift in the warm climates ultimately may arise from the strengthening of tropical convection. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4564], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Mee Rea ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mee Rea", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Sukyung Lee", "Sukyung Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Sukyung Lee, Thesis Advisor", "Sukyung Lee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["climate warming", "baroclinic life cycle", "poleward jet shift"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Configurable Accelerators for Visual and Text Analytics", "id": "23019", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10545", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Continuously recording a person's daily life and creating a digital backup of it is no longer just science fiction.\nCurrent lifelogging technologies allow us to automatically capture every single minute of a person's experience from wearable sensors.\nHowever, how to efficiently manage the captured personal multimedia data and provide user services using the data still remains a great challenge.\nThis dissertation presents a proposal to leverage hardware acceleration for a personal analytics system that can continuously capture a person's daily life and respond user queries using the captured lifelog.\nFirst, two visual accelerators for biologically-inspired recognition are introduced: HMAX accelerator for object recognition and gist accelerator for scene recognition.\nThis includes a description of the novel architecture, and an analysis of the experimental results of each accelerator by comparing its performance to contemporary solutions on different platforms. \nSecond, a prototype system of personal analytics, which consists of front-end recognition and back-end text analytics, is presented to realize the vision of creating a lifelog system that enables total recall through total capture of a person's everyday experience.\nThird, a text accelerator for Naive Bayes multiclass classifier is presented to support the real-time text processing of the back-end analytics in personal analytics system.\nBy leveraging these visual and text accelerators, the front-end system is able to extract essential information from multimedia data and transmit the lifelog data into the back-end system in real-time.

The statistical basis consists of two components \u2013 a frequency component and a severity component. The two components are linked via a recursive modeling structure where the frequency evaluation is conducted at a segmental level. In particular, I demonstrate this evaluation at the interchange level of spacing. I evaluate the entire interstate network in Washington State, via a longitudinal analysis of crash histories for the period 1999-2007. For the nine year period, I collected geometric and traffic volume information, and evaluated crash cost bases for the most severe outcome of a crash.  \nThe frequency component is motivated by the need to fill the gap in the extant literature. Current literature is sparse if not nonexistent in terms of insights on heterogeneity in the overdispersion parameter effect at the segmental level of analysis. The overdispersion parameter is modeled as a parametric function of highway geometry, resulting in a heterogeneous negative binomial model structure. Further, to improve insights into the effects of geometry from a design policy standpoint and enhance our understanding of the performance basis of geometric elements, I develop heterogeneous negative binomial models of heterogeneous geometry \u2013 based on the definition of segmental geometry that can consist of below-standard, at-standard and above-standard design elements. By using this approach, enhanced insight is developed due to the fact that interactions between varying standards within a segment effectively capture statistical information observed from reported crashes. This is shown by improvements in likelihoods over contemporary models which employ a non-standards approach.  \nThe second major contribution of this dissertation is the severity analytical component which is built as a second stage component. In the second stage analysis, the severity models are constructed using collision type information, as opposed to the traditional approach of involving geometrics. This allows the simplification of severity models at the unconditional level to highly tractable multinomial type specifications \u2013 a computational advantage for computing efficiently the severity outcomes on entire networks.  \nThe two-stage statistical basis thus developed in this dissertation offers a plausible and tractable methodology for determining accurately cost bases for the identification of high priority safety investment corridors. The fact that multi-year histories are used in both stages implies that the findings can be potentially robust and therefore contribute to stable parameter estimation and therefore increase our confidence in our understanding of the effect of geometry and collision type on crash frequency and severity.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8034], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Minho ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Swagata Banerjee", "Tao Yao", "Jeremy Joseph Blum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Dissertation Advisor", "Swagata Banerjee, Committee Chair", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geometric Effects", "Crash Frequency", "Accident Severity", "Heterogeneous Negative Binomial Model", "Multinomial Logit Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFICIENT MEAN-SHIFT BELIEF PROPAGATION\nAND ITS APPLICATIONS IN COMPUTER VISION", "id": "11156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4433", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are widely used in many areas of computer vision and machine learning. Since classic belief propagation is not suitable for a continuous state space, sampling-based belief propagation methods have been developed, e.g. non-parametric belief propagation (NBP). However NBP requires a large number of samples and its resampling process is slow, preventing its wide applicability. We are motivated to develop an efficient belief propagation method. Starting with a new heuristic method, mean-shift belief propagation (MSBP) that works iteratively with local weighted samples to infer max-marginals within a large or continuous state space, we further propose a novel data-driven MSBP (DDMSBP) based on recent work of smoothing-based optimization that is even more robust at finding a significant mode of the marginal density. We prove that the inference time for DDMSBP is bilinear in terms of the number of samples and the number of nodes in a graph for arbitrary unary potential functions as long as the pair-wise compatibility functions remain Gaussian. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel MSBP and DDMSBP methods through simulation and on five challenging computer vision applications: 1) multi-target tracking, 2) 2D articulated body tracking, 3) 3D deformable neuro-image registration, 4) detection of near-regular patterns in real-world images, and 5) perceptual grouping of 2D lattices in urban scenes. \n\nThe main contributions of this thesis are: 1) the development and validation of a provable inference algorithm DDMSBP for PGMs with state of the art performance; and 2) a set of novel, robust and efficient solutions to five challenging computer vision problems.

For sensor applications, nanostructures provide high surface area to volume ratios. The high surface area to volume ratio allows more reaction areas between target species and detection materials and also improves the detection sensitivity and response time. The main goal of this research was to exploit the advantages and develop innovative methods to accomplish the synthesis of nanowires and nano-coulmn conducting polymers used in humidity detection. To accomplish this, two fabrication methods are used.  The first one utilizes the geometric confinement effect of a temporary nanochannel template to orient, precisely position, and assemble Polyaniline (PANI) nanowires as they are synthesized. The other approach is to simply spin-coat a polymer onto a substrate, and then oxygen plasma etch to generate a nano-columned Polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) thin film. 200 nm silicon oxide coated wafers with embedded platinum electrodes are used as a substrate for both fabrication methods. The biggest advantage of this first method is that it is simple, requires a single-step, i.e., synthesizing and positioning procedures are carried out simultaneously. The second method is potentially manufacturable and economic yet environmentally safe. These two methods do not produce extra nano-building materials to discard or create a health hazard.  \nBoth PANI nanowires and nano-columned PEDOT films have been tested for humidity detection using a system designed and built for this research to monitor response (current changes) to moisture, To explain the surface to volume ratio effect, 200 nm PANI nanowires and 10 &#956;m PANI wires were directly compared for detecting moisture, and it was shown that the PANI nanowire had a better sensitivity. It was found difficult to monitor the behaviors of the PEDOT reaction to varying moisture levels because even low humidity levels saturate the sample surface within a few minutes. Because of this, it was not perfect to distinguish the effects of etching the PEDOT film for humidity detection and difficult to apply nano-columned PEDOT films as a humidity sensors under continuously changing humidity conditions. However, nano-columned PEDOT films showed excellent performance in simulated breath tests, i.e., an area where the medical needs sensors for pulmonary monitoring. \nSince the polymers are sensitive to heat, it was important to characterize the influence of temperature on the sensor performance. PANI nanowires and nano-columned PEDOT sensors were tested in the environmental chamber developed in this work as a function of temperature with the humidity fixed, and only the temperature was varied. The PANI nanowires showed very fast degradation at temperatures above room temperature, while the nano-columned PEDOT film performed up to 50 \u00b0C. The influence of other gases was also tested for the potential of gas sensing, selectivity, and chemical stability. In order to exclude the moisture effect during the measurement, the samples were characterized under the lowest humidity condition, RH 14 % preserved in the system. Under these conditions the PANI nanowires responded to the gases (hydrogen and carbon monoxide were used), but the moisture inside the PANI nanowire was forced to influence the gas detection. Therefore, samples were dried overnight under a nitrogen environment and tested again. With this careful control of the moisture present, it was found that PANI nanowires respond to both hydrogen and carbon monoxide gases, however, there is no selectivity between gases. Nano-columned PEDOT films were also tested under the same experimental moisture-controlling conditions. It was shown that there was little response to other gases. Any response that may have been presented was buried in the electrical noise. Finally, both samples were tested for long-term stability. PANI nanowires showed almost linear degradation with continuous use, while nano-columned PEDOT was stable over extended periods of time. The PANI nanowires were more reactive to the environment compared to the nano-columned PEDOT films. The only disadvantage of the nano-columned PEDOT sensor structure is that it loses its durability when it is directly exposed to liquid water or highly saturated humidity for long periods of time. A surface treatment of PEDOT was developed that enhanced its durability against water without degrading its sensor performance. Nano-columned PEDOT films look promising for breath sensors for medical usage because they have sub-second response times and are relatively chemically and physically stable.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4996], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Pilyeon  ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pilyeon ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Fonash", "Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Barbara Shaw", "Sanjay B Joshi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Fonash, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conducting polymers", "humidity sensors", "Nanotechnology"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Classification of Transients by Distance Measures", "id": "26313", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11445", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to a rapidly increasing size of data in astronomical surveys, statistical methods which can automatically classify newly detected celestial objects in an accurate\nand efficient way have become essential.

This study intended to contribute to the understanding of active housewives\u00a1\u00af learning in a community-based organization. Using ethnographic methods such as the observation, the interview, and the interpretation of documents, I conducted research in a community-based organization, Green Future, in a city in Korea, in which the housewives have guided and taught the natural environment to the residents. The collected data were analyzed by the conceptual and theoretical frameworks of cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) and feminist standpoint theory. \nI found that the housewives have moved from the periphery toward full participation in the practice and adopted the activity as their profession as well as learned the knowledge and skills, as they continued to participate in the activity of the organization. But their learning in the community-based organization was not confined to only this kind of learning. They have been transformed into the practitioners to keep the natural environment within the community, that is, the agents to facilitate community development in terms of use value, not of exchange value. The first thing I found in the study was also that active learning of the housewives has appeared with the expansion of their activities in the community-based organization. Their activities have continuously been reconstructed through the emergence and settlement of the contradictions within and between the elements of activity as well as the interaction with neighboring activities. Their expansive learning was not simple movement from the periphery of the activity to the center, but continuous reconstruction and production of new knowledge and activity in the community depending on the housewives\u00a1\u00af standpoint.\nThrough the CHAT analysis of the community-based learning, finally, I was able to find that it has an important implication for adult education; what people informally learn in everyday life or every place such as the workplace, the home, and the community could be articulated by the connection with the collective activity of human being.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6002], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sangok ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sangok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied", "Ian E Baptiste", "Esther Susana Prins", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied, Committee Chair", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cultural Historical Activity Theory", "CHAT", "Community-based organization", "expansive learning", "standpoint theory", "Informal learning", "Housewives"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATION OF A PIEZOELECTRIC ULTRASONIC MOTOR INTO A LOW TEMPERATURE COFIRED CERAMIC PACKAGE\nFOR ACTIVE OPTICAL FIBER ALIGNMENT\n\n", "id": "7791", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The major goal of this thesis was to integrate an ultrasonic motor into a ceramic package and demonstrate a useful function of the device. The chosen demonstration was a fiber-optic alignment package that utilized the strengths of the piezoelectric motor, such as its small size, low power consumption, fine position resolution, quick response and high power to weight ratio. In order to demonstrate this functionality a number of key research tasks had to be undertaken.\nSpecifically, materials development of a low fire, piezoelectric ceramic with properties that would remain stable under high power drive conditions was required. The piezoelectric ceramic had to be processed at a firing temperature that made it compatible with low temperature cofired ceramics (LTCC) and silver electrodes.\nA piezoelectric miniaturized motor was designed using the electromechanical properties of piezoelectric ceramic. The motor was designed around two resonance modes that enabled an elliptical motion of the tip, which then permitted the possibility of 2 degrees of freedom when a bimorph structure was used. The motor was designed and optimized using ATILA finite element method (FEM) simulations. The motor design considered the key geometric factors controlling the resonance modes and vibration amplitudes. The motor was also considered with a variety of different electrical drive conditions and the properties were tested with prototyped motors. The properties included resonance behaviors, characterization of displacements, torque, efficiency, and so on. Based on these studies a cofired structure was then developed and similarly characterized.\nOne of the important goals in this research was to cofire the ultrasonic motor with LTCC in order to create a reliable housing structure with low fabrication costs and facilitate mass production. In order to achieve this, various thermal, mechanical and structural factors were considered during a cofiring process. Finally, the ultrasonic motors were successfully cofired with commercial LTCC green tapes as well as with silver electrodes without encountering delamination or bending problems.\nIn the final part of the thesis, a LTCC packaged structure was designed and fabricated with the integrated piezoelectric motors. These motors were then driven with a computer controlled circuit that was designed to aid a procedure aimed at optical alignment between a fiber and a laser. Once alignment was achieved, a pre-stressed structure with springs maintained the position of the fiber without any external electrical field or adhesive material. This package design provided a unique ability to adjust and realign an optical fiber in the case where misalignment occurs during installation or use. The optical package was characterized for thermal stability over a temperature ranging from room temperature to 50 oC. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6004], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Seung Ho ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seung Ho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Clive A Randall", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Michael T Lanagan", "Heath Hofmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Heath Hofmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cofiring", "Ultrasonic motor", "Piezoelectric", "Alignment", "High Power"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SELF-REGULATION OF ACADEMIC PROCRASTINATION: A MIXED METHODS STUDY\n\n", "id": "9051", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5862", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous procrastination research has provided considerable support for procrastination as a failure of self-regulation.

Using a mixed-methods study, forty-one students completed measures of students\u2019 academic procrastination and their self-regulation and academic motivation and participated in semi-structured interviews conducted to explore students\u2019 perceptions of and their reasons for procrastination. Results indicate that academic procrastination was related to students\u2019 defensive behaviors including self-handicapping as well as low use of regulatory strategies. Support for students\u2019 demonstration of procrastination as an adaptive behavior (\u201cactive procrastination\u201d) was also indicated. Implications for both research and practice are provided.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5859], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Seung Won  ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seung Won ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rayne Audrey Sperling", "Rayne Audrey Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rayne Audrey Sperling, Thesis Advisor", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["procrastination", "self-regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "ROBUST INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND GRAPHS\n", "id": "6396", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6006", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three important topics on information retrieval research: (a) robust information retrieval on the web, (b)characterization and modelization of network graphs, and (c) design and development of an information retrieval tool by using the knowledge and techniques we obtained from our graph analysis study. <p>\n\nFirst, the thesis proposes new lexical signature (LS) generative methods for managing broken link (invalid hyperlink) problems. A lexical signature consisting of several keywords from a web document is often sufficient information in order to find the document later, even if its URL has changed. We first extend the performance criteria of LSs by replacing the first unique extraction property with a slightly weaker notation. As long as LSs return the target documents in the first rank, the first criterion is satisfied. Then, we add another criterion so that LSs extract highly relevant (or similar) information when the target documents cannot be found. Other performance criteria of LSs, proposed by previous research but not investigated, are search engine independence, robustness against minor document modification, and minimal conflict between existing and new LSs. We conduct a large-scale empirical study on nine methods for generating LSs, including Phelps and Wilensky's original proposal (PW), seven of our own static variations, and one new dynamic method. We examine their performances on the web over a ten-month period, and on a TREC data set, evaluating their abilities based on the five previously-mentioned performance criteria. DF is good at unique identification but poor at finding relevant documents. PW performs well on the latter data set, but more like DF on the web. TF is easy to compute and maintain, and often performs well, but depends on how the search engine ranks the documents. TFIDF and hybrid methods perform well on both real web data and on the idealized TREC data. We also propose a method called Test and Select (TS) that chooses a LS dynamically. TS attempts to avoid LS conflict at the time a new one is generated. We find that TS dominates all eight static approaches over three different search engines. All LS methods experience significant performance degradation when documents are modified significantly. To ensure reasonable performance, periodic updating of LSs may be required. <p>\n\nSince the big success of Google's search engine, the information retrieval research community has been paying much attention to graph analysis. Several graph-based ranking algorithms, e.g. PageRank and HITS, have been proposed. Collaborative filtering algorithms are other examples using structures of information graphs. \nBecause of its simplicity, availability of abundant data, and similarity to other information graphs, we decided to study the characteristics and models of the Internet AS topology as the first step in our graph analysis research. We first analyze the susceptibility of the Internet to random faults, malicious attacks, and mixtures of faults and attacks. We introduce new metrics for analyzing the connectivity and performance of networks, which improve on metrics used in earlier research. We find that preferential networks, including the Internet, are more robust only when more than 95% of failures are random faults, and robustness is measured with an average diameter. The advantage of preferential networks disappears with alternative metrics, and when a small fraction of faults are attacks. We also identify dynamic characteristics of the Internet that can be used to create improved network models. We find that the Internet is becoming more preferential as it evolves. In fact, the average diameter has been stable or even decreasing as the number of nodes has been increasing. The Internet is becoming more robust to random failures over time, but has also become more vulnerable to attacks.<p>\n\nAfter our first research on Internet AS topology, we obtain other alternative Internet topology data. We examine six metrics ---three existing metrics and three of our own--- applied to two large publicly-available topology data sets to find invariant metrics. %Certain metrics highlight differences between the two topologies, while one of our static metrics and several dynamic metrics display an invariance between the data sets. These may capture properties inherent to the Internet and independent of measurement methodology, and so may serve as better gauges for validating models. We continue by testing nine models, seven existing models and two of our own, applying these metrics to the two data sets. Our two new models perform better than any other growth model across all metrics. Compared with Inet, our models are very simple. As growth models, they provide a possible explanation for the processes underlying the Internet's growth, explaining, for example, why the Internet's degree distribution is more skewed than baseline models would predict. We also measure three dynamic characteristics of a citation graph from the CiteSeer database. We find that the citation graph shows very different dynamic growth patterns from those of the Internet; skewness and average diameter increase while the clustering coefficient decreases over time. Thus, the dynamic characteristics of the Internet can guide us to build a more accurate Internet topology generator. <p>\n\nFinally, the thesis addresses design and implementation issues of an information retrieval tool, a prototype movie search-engine called MAD6, which uses information graph structures to find relevant items. This application aims at meeting the expectations of users which are not satisfied by existing commercial movie search engines. To achieve this objective, we propose five design goals for MAD6: (1) The interface should be simple and queries should not be limited. (2) Items should be ranked according to a relevance judgment over the given query. (3) MAD6  should also present information on items related to the current item. (4) emph{MAD6} should provide recommendations to users. (5) MAD6 should provide a personalized ranking mechanism based on users' preferences. Since the current implementation of MAD6 has successfully achieved the first three goals, this thesis mainly discusses the issues involved with reaching these goals. The major barrier to achieving the remaining two goals is the lack of user preference data. However, we plan to add those features using data from Yahoo!Movies in the near future. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5998], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Seung-Taek ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seung-Taek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "David M Pennock", "Wang Chien Lee", "Peng Liu", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "David M Pennock, Committee Chair", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Peng Liu, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["static and dynamic characteristics of network mode", "graph-based network models", "lexical signatures", "broken link problems", "faults and attacks", "movie search engines", "movie graphs"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS OF HAND GRIP MOTION FOR OPTIMAL HANDLE DESIGN USING A CADAVER MODEL\n\n\n", "id": "9950", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forceful exertion of tendons while gripping hand tools may be one of the factors that lead to the development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). Also, the ratio between internal tendon force and externally applied grip force is necessary to design an optimal handle size to maximize efficiency of the force and reduce an excessive tendon force. Previous research has indicated that Flexor Digitorum Profundus (FDP) and Flexor Digitorum Superficialis (FDS) forces can be up to 3.7 times the external forces predicted by a biomechanical model. However, these values were indirect estimates derived from the biomechanical model to predict internal tendon forces. Although anatomically precise, the model was challenging to implement in practice, since they require input parameters that are often difficult or impossible to measure. Therefore, it is imperative that the model is validated with direct measurement of tendon forces using human cadaver forearms. The cadaver model with hand motion simulator allowed the application of controlled forces to the flexor tendons by the force delivery unit while the resulting grip forces are measured with force sensitive resistors. Consequently, the actual tendon forces generated by the actuators ware compared with externally applied force (grip force and finger force distribution) in power grip motion with various diameter handles. Moreover, the effect of different tendon force ratios of FDP to FDS was investigated to explore kinematic role of the ratio in power grip motion. Also, the resulting data were compared to similar measures reported in the literature and input to mathematical model to validate. Despite some differences, in general the hand motion simulator with a cadaver model produced finger kinematics closely resembling those that occur in normal human grasping and showed similar hand biomechanics result with previous studies that investigated grip force and finger force distribution with handles.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6000], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Shihyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shihyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "Andris Freivalds", "David J Cannon", "Ling Rothrock", "Neil Sharkey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Dissertation Advisor", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "David J Cannon, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hand tool design", "Flexor tendon force", "Grip force", "Hand Biomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "From social motives to spiritual development: A Cultural Historical Activity Theory analysis of communal spiritual development in a Korean American house church", "id": "19720", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9390", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study focused on a unique culturally shaped church formation, a Korean house church in the U. S., and how the members of the Korean house church learn and develop their spirituality in their communal relations and activities. As a more tightly knitted small group, the Korean house church facilitated the inclusion of the marginalized Korean Americans in their relations and activities, and in the process of the inclusion in the house church, the Korean Americans have been deeply involved in communal spiritual development activities by actively settling in the religious group as a regular member instead of their past barriers and by spiritually making more meaningful relationships with God and others.\nThis qualitative study used ethnographical inquiry to investigate the communal spiritual development activities of seven members of Canaan Mokjang, a house church, by interviewing and observing them in their house and church (SBCH) over a two-month period. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as the analytical framework, and it provided the useful comprehensive framework to understand informal religious learning as a socio-cultural phenomenon within the house church context. Indeed, learning occurred in the dynamic relations and complex interactions of the subject and object in the house church, mediated with a diverse socio-cultural religious context and actions. \nThis study revealed three communal spiritual development activities (activity systems) by adopting CHAT to analyze the informed data from the seven participants: social engagement, spiritual union, and spiritual leadership development. Through the three activity systems, participants have developed their motives from social engagement to spiritual unions to spiritual development by observing and experiencing various social and spiritual practices. The participants found a different relationship within the house church, and the relationship allowed them to be more tightly linked to other members. In this sense, they called their relations a \u201cspiritual family.\u201d Although some contradictions occurred during the process of performing the three activity systems and often these hampered them to be more involved in the activities, the process of overcoming the contradictions caused the participants to learn how they engaged in the religious small group, how they could be a spiritual family, and how they focused on developing spiritual leaders and their spirituality. \nFrom the research findings, this study discussed how a collective informal learning process of a small religious group in the communal spiritual development activities could transcend the boundary of limitation of formal and nonformal learning processes of traditional church, and how CHAT as an analytical framework could help the researcher to find the complex interactions, contradictions and learning processes in the religious informal learning context. Although there were several limitations in the study, this study provided some implications for adult religious education and some suggestions for the further research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9189], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sinwoong ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sinwoong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Kuhne", "Gary Kuhne", "Fred Michael Schied", "Melody M Thompson", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Kuhne, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Chair", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Member", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adult Education", "Spiritual Development", "House Church", "Community of Faith", "Cultural Historical Activity Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Development of Proteoliposome- and Nanowell-based Platforms to Assess P-glycoprotein Transport Activity ", "id": "13446szp164", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13446", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents two platforms developed to assess transport activities of multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pump, called P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Pgp is a transmembrane protein that is believed to be responsible for MDR of cells against broad range of small molecules. This nonspecific transport activity limits the efficacy of a number of orally induced drugs, as Pgp is expressed on the membranes of various cell types including apical surface of abdomen, epithelial cells of blood-brain barrier, and especially cancer cells. Food and Drug Administration stresses criticality of Pgp in the drug development phase by reinforcing drug screening against Pgp in the approval process. Therefore, effective and efficient techniques to screen the intercations between candidate drugs and Pgp are in high demand. To this end, we developed two assay platforms employing model membrane systems: 1) giant proteoliposome-based assay and 2) a platform with pore-spanning bilayer over an array of nanosized wells.\nGiant proteoliposomes bearing Pgp with size and composition similar to that of cell plasma membrane are excellent biomimetic system to exclusively monitor the interaction between Pgp and its substrates. In this thesis, transport activity of Pgp across the giant proteoliposome membrane was assessed by translocation of Pgp fluorescent substrate, rhodamine123 (Rho123). We monitored Rho123 transport into the giant proteoliposome lumen upon activation by ATP. The results showed that Rho123 transport rate with ATP concentration followed Michaelis-Menton kinetics, and complete inhibition was achieved with 40 \u00b5M verapamil, a Pgp competitive inhibitor.\n For the nanowell-based Pgp transport activity, an array of nanowells with 200 nm diameter and 800 nm depth was fabricated on a quartz substrate. Giant proteoliposome ruptured on the substrate surface, forming pore-spanning bilayer. Using this platform, we monitored Rho123 transport into the nanowells by active Pgp. \nIn conclusion, giant-proteoliposome and nanowell-based platforms were developed to assess the transport activity of Pgp. This thesis presents the detailed records of optimization processes and assay results and analysis from the two platforms. Finally, we anticipate that these techniques will provide outstanding platforms to assess interactions between Pgp and drug candidates under development in near future.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13672], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Soohyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soohyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sheereen Majd", "Sheereen Majd", "William O Hancock", "Peter J Butler", "Manish Kumar", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sheereen Majd, Dissertation Advisor", "Sheereen Majd, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Manish Kumar, Outside Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Giant liposome", "P-glycoprotein", "Multidrug resistance", "Pore-spanning bilayer"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF SIMPLE AND VERSATILE FABRICATION TECHNIQUE TO PATTERN CONDUCTING POLYMER FILMS FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS\n", "id": "26722", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11879", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conducting polymers (CPs) are easy to process and have tunable physical and chemical properties including conductivity, volume, color, and hydrophobicity. Therefore, these organic polymers are attractive in a broad spectrum of biomedical applications ranging from implentable electornics, and biosensing to tissue engineering and drug delivery. Patterning CP films, particularly with various surface chemistries, provide excellent platforms for biosensing and cell engineering. In this study, we developed a unique and verstaile method for direct patterning of CP films on substrates. This technique employs an agarose hydrogel stamp as a carrier of polymer precursor solution including monomers and dopants. Upon placement of the stamp on an electrode and subsequent application of a current, the polymerization of monomer only occurred in the contact areas between the topographically-patterned hydrogel and the gold substrate. This hydrogel-mediated electropolymerization technique was able to generate positive patterns of CP films with different sizes and geometries in a single-step and solution-free process. Further, the posts on a hydrogel stamp could deliver different monomer/dopant combinations to create a patterned CP film with different and addressable surface chemistries in a parallel fashion. More importantly, the incorporation of the fragile biomolecule in the polymer network could be achieved in one-step process.\nExtending the scope of this technique, we generated a CP film with molecular gradient to be applied for cellular studies where cell behaviors could be controlled by the gradient of biomarkers on the surface. Also, the transfer of the patterned CP films onto transparent, elastic, and non-conductive substrate was attempted for the potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Together, we believe that the proposed technique has great potential for sophisticated patterning of CP films with concise and direct protocols, and that the technique has great advantages over other conventional lithographic techniques for its simplicity and efficiency. \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11332], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Soohyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soohyun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Sheereen Majd", "William O Hancock", "Mohammad Reza Abidian", "Siyang Zheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Sheereen Majd, Thesis Advisor", "William O Hancock, Thesis Advisor", "Mohammad Reza Abidian, Thesis Advisor", "Siyang Zheng, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conducting Polymer", "Microfabrication", "Hydrogel"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Relationship of Pennsylvania Career and Technical Educators\u2019 Work Engagement to Satisfaction with Cte Teacher Preparation Coursework", "id": "25983", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11546", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Career and technical education (CTE) teachers in Pennsylvania typically enter service without teacher certification and little or no pedagogical training.

Although it can be argued that public sector organizations increasingly face similar pressures as the pressures on the private sector, public sector organizations, partly because of their public ownership and limited competition, may not pursue KM as strongly and effectively as private sector organizations. It seems, therefore, reasonable to expect that there will be differences in understanding, best practice, and performance indicators between the two sectors and how they impact drivers for KM activity. There are differences in how to create value from effectively managing knowledge in the private and public sector contexts, and that these differences will be reflected in KM strategy practice. \nThe purpose of this study is to test empirically the basic KM argument that KM in public organizations differs from that carried out in private organization. In the literature review, the key dimensions of KM are described (chapter 2). This includes arguments about \u2018what knowledge is\u2019 (definition, features, types, and perspective of knowledge), and \u2018what knowledge management is\u2019 (definition, principles, process, and implementation of knowledge management). Moreover, I explained current situation that KM in public organizations is still underrated even thought KM is so important to public organizations. As needed for the purpose of research, I reviewed general arguments about similarities or differences between public and private organization. Lastly, in the literature review, I introduced the \u2018management in the 1990s research program by MIT\u2019 as one part of the research model.\nIn Chapter 3, the methodology for this study is presented. Research model and the hypotheses were developed based on Hansen, Nohria, and Tierney\u2019s model (1999) and MIT90s Framework (Scott Morton, 1991). The processes of measurement such as variables operationalization, methods of data collection, units of analysis, and sample are presented.\nChapter 4 covers the analysis and the findings from the survey. In here, first, I analyzed the characteristics of survey respondents according to position, age, gender and education. Second, I tested the hypotheses which were developed to compare KM in both the private and the public sector. Most hypotheses are not supported. Even though the results are contrary to my hypotheses, I found significant differences between public and private organization in some aspects of KM. In knowledge management process, the private organization focuses more on all knowledge processes stages (the storage and retrieval, transfer and sharing, and application of knowledge) than the public organization. Moreover, the result of the test for the degree of codification hypothesis shows that the private organization follows more codification knowledge strategies than personalization knowledge strategies. The means of private organization for the rest of all aspects which are related to codification strategy is significantly higher than those of public organization. Third, factor analysis is applied to identify small number of factors that summarize observed correlations among codification and personalization variables. Fourth, the relationship between the codification and personalization dimension is tested with correlation analysis. The major implication of this is that effective organizations tend to emphasize to a similar degree both codification and personalization knowledge management strategies. \nChapter 5 presents the conclusions for this study. It is divided into five sections. In first section, an overview of the purpose of the study and the summary of research are presented. The second section covers the suggestions for KM to public organizations. The third section discusses the implication and contributions of this study. The fourth section discusses the possible future research. The final section presents the limitations of this study. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5529], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sung Chul ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung Chul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frances T.

Additionally, using the F-TES ADT, spin cast OTFTs which show mobilities of greater than 1.0 cm2 / V\u00d7s with relatively good film uniformity have been obtained. Film growth which is considerably more ordered on pentafluorobenzene (PFBT) treated Au surfaces, and on samples with patterned PFBT-Au structures grains appear to grow out from the PFBT-Au areas into the oxide areas were observed. This results in a substantial variation in field effect mobility with gate length as grains growing from the source and drain electrodes meet and overlap.  Spun F-TES ADT OTFTs fabricated with films deposited on PFBT-treated Au electrodes show mobilities of 0.1 - 0.5 cm2/V\u00d7s from a toluene solution and 0.2 - 1.0 cm2 / V\u00d7s from a cholobenzene solution.\n\nThe potential application for solution processed OTFTs was examined by performing operational and environmental stability tests.  In addition, 7 and 15-stage ring oscillators were fabricated on both glass and plastic substrates.  The 7-stage ring oscillators on a plastic substrate operate at more than 22 kHz.  The circuits also operate at low voltages with oscillation beginning at a supply voltage of about - 3 V and operate at  2.8 kHz at - 5 V. In an effort to optimally design a soluble small molecule organic semiconductor, we investigated molecular ordering, orientation, packing structure, and surface morphology of several different soluble small molecule organic semiconductors and compared their electrical performance. \n\n A patterning technology of solution processed organic films which could be applied to OTFT circuits and flat panel displays was developed. Using an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) self assembled monolayer (SAM) patterned by deep ultra-violet light (185 and 254 nm), 7-stage ring oscillators with patterned solution processed organic films were fabricated.  For future researches, solution processed OTFT integrated circuits such as novel logic gates, D-flip flop and a 5-stage frequency divider were designed and simulated. Also an entirely solution processible flat panel display were designed and demonstrated by using waveform simulations for practical feasibility of solution processed OTFT driven liquid crystal displays.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6001], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sung Kyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung Kyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Christopher Roman Wronski", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Qing Wang", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Christopher Roman Wronski, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Organic Thin Film Transistors", "Solution Processed OTFT", "Organic circuits", "Molecular electronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Structural studies on Sinorhizobium meliloti DctD related to ATP binding and activation", "id": "5948", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6005", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sinorhizobium meliloti DctD activates transcription at the dctA promoter by catalyzing the transformation of closed complex of Es54 (RNA polymerase/sigma-54) into open ones in response to the phosphorylation status of DctB, a C4-dicarboxylate sensor. DctD is s54-dependent transcriptional activator, and consists of three functional domains: an N-terminal, two-component receiver domain; a central AAA+ ATPase domain; and a C-terminal DNA binding domain. Since the DctB and DctD proteins form a two-component regulatory system, it is easy to hypothesize a general outline of signal transduction for these proteins. But detailed molecular mechanisms underlying two-component signal transduction have only recently begun to emerge from research in several labs. \nAs a step toward understanding molecular events involved in the DctB/DctD signaling system in Sinorhizobium meliloti, I have investigated its several aspects. Tryptic digestion experiments of DctD with or without ATP showed that unphosphorylated 44 kD has the ability to bind ATP, and, upon ATP binding, undergoes conformational changes, which is registered in changes in the pattern of tryptic digestion. By modeling the decay of the 44 kD peptide at varying amounts of ATP as a combination of two first order processes; one with and one without ATP being bound, it was possible to estimate an equilibrium dissociation constant of approximately 0.7 mM for ATP. Subsequent pre-steady state kinetic studies of mant-ATP binding to DctD gave the rough estimation of an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.87 mM. The results of both experiments suggest that the receiver domain does not play its role simply by preventing the AAA+ ATPase domain from binding ATP.  \nCrystallographic studies on the receiver domains of DctD and its variant, E121K, revealed another important feature of this signaling system. The crystal structure of E121KNL obtained with or without Mg2+ and BeF3-1 showed that, in the active state mimicked by Mg2+- BeF3-1, E121KNL has changes induced in the active site similar to those seen in FixJN~P, Spo0AN~P and CheY-BeF3-1, and assumes a dimer interface dramatically different from that of the off-state E121KNL. \nAlong with the results of previous crystallographic and genetic studies, the following 'working model' for signal transduction in DctD can be proposed. In the 'off-state', the receiver domain and coiled-coil linker form a dimer that inhibits oligomerization of the AAA+ ATPase domain. In this conformation the receiver domain cannot be phosphorylated or bind Mg2+ and BeF3-1. The binding of Mg2+ and BeF3-1 stabilizes an alternative dimeric conformation in which the a4-\u00df5-a5 interface is replaced with an a4-\u00df5 interface, thereby repositioning the phosphorylation site (Asp55) in the subunits by ~20 \u00c5. Reorienting the receiver domains relieves inhibition of the AAA+ ATPase domain by at least allowing or even stimulating it to oligomerize and activate transcription at the dctA promoter. Since ~4.5 % of two-component receiver domains are predicted to have coiled-coil linkers found in DctD, switching between alternate dimeric states as seen in DctD may be a common mechanism used by a subgroup of two-component regulatory systems. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5997], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sungdae ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sungdae", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Daniel Jones", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "B Tracy Nixon", "Richard John Frisque", "C \ufffdP David Tu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Daniel Jones, Committee Member", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Chair", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "C \ufffdP David Tu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DCTD"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A COMPARISON OF REGRESSION MODELS FOR INCIDENT RATE PREDICTION IN A CANADIAN POWER COMPANY\n\n\n", "id": "10804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents a comparison of regression models used to characterize relationships between incident rate (IR) and safety interventions applied in a Canadian Power Company.  Quantitative analyses were used to evaluate IR prediction models extracted using Partial Least Squares (PLS), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), and Stepwise regression methods. Data consisting of weekly time sheets recording incidents and safety training (intervention) activities were collected from two Service Groups in the Hydro One Company  The percentages of total man-hours devoted to four categories of interventions activities (Factor A - Safety Awareness and Motivation Activities, Factor B - Skill Development and Training Activities, Factor C - New Tools and Equipment Design Methods and Activities, and Factor D - Equipment Related Activities) were treated as input variables for regression models.   The specific aims of this study were to: 1) Determine whether PLS regression models perform better than OLS regression models for IR prediction, 2) Identify and characterize the intervention application rates associated with the lowest incident rates, and 3) Evaluate whether models developed within the same company, but using data from different operating units, could successfully predict IR for new data sets.\nResults show that while PLS- and OLS-based regression models employing all main factors and interaction terms as input variables (15 parameters) performed well for calibration data sets (R2 = 0.86-0.94, Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) = 4-15%), performance was poor for validation data sets (R2 = 0.70-0.86, Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) = 200-700%).  Differences in the characteristics/distribution of the input variables between calibration and validation data sets and possible seasonal trends are likely to contribute to these large errors. The extracted PLS regression model was used to examine appropriate levels of intervention activities by employing the Excel\u00ae Solver function to identify intervention activity distributions that resulted in the lowest incident rates. Solver-identified intervention levels represented approximately 16-17% of total man-hours which is slightly higher than previously published results of 11-15% of total man-hours for \u201coptimal\u201d resource allocation.  It is not clear that slight modifications in safety intervention allocations would be feasible or desirable given variability in the reporting and tracking of individual supervisors\u2019 time sheets, and uncertainty as to whether a cause-effect relationship exists between safety intervention activities and reported incidents.\nApplication of IR prediction models to different work groups was conducted to evaluate model generalizability. Results showed that neither Service Group\u2019s prediction model could be successfully applied to the other group to estimate IR. Differences in data collection periods and changes potentially affecting the quantity and quality of the safety interventions, such as, equipment development, skills enhancement, employees, and safety culture, seem likely to contribute to the inability of IR prediction models to generalize.  Any future attempt to model IR as a function of safety interventions should include an analysis using both quantitative and qualitative data characterizing intervention activities over longer time frames.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6006], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sunghae ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sunghae", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Arthur Groves", "William Arthur Groves"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Arthur Groves, Thesis Advisor", "William Arthur Groves, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["OLS regression", "Safety Intervention", "PLS regression"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "system-on-chip integration of heterogeneous accelerators for perceptual computing", "id": "19218", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9248", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditional microprocessor design has seen radical shifts over the past few years. The challenges of excessive power consumption led to the shift from faster and more complex processors to multiple cores on the same chip. More recently, there has been a growing trend towards integrating multiple customized cores instead of homogeneous arrays of processors. The distinction between embedded heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) Architectures and mainstream processor architectures is blurring. A key challenge in both these domains is to efficiently integrate these accelerators in a single chip.\nThis dissertation contributes towards making the design of system-on-a-chip architectures more flexible, more programmable, and easier to develop and verify. Specifically, a communication and interface framework to integrate heterogeneous accelerators for this domain is proposed. This framework has been incorporated to develop SoC designs for two different perceptual computing applications, visual perception and wireless body-area networks (WBANs). Perceptual computing applications perceive intent by sensing and monitoring different activities of a person and their environments. To support visual perception, a system for detecting, tracking and recognizing objects has been built using the proposed framework. A system has also been developed for supporting compressed sensing of medical signals from the human body for perceptual medical diagnostic applications. These two frameworks demonstrate the flexibility of the framework to compose different systems.\nThis dissertation also contributes to the design of approximate computing techniques for design of energy-efficient systems. These techniques leverage the programmable aspect of the proposed communication/interface framework. First, the complexity of computation is varied based on relative salience of an object in a visual scene to expend non-uniform effort on an entire scene while providing a quality of output similar to expending same effort across the scene. Second, mathematical approximations are employed to reduce the effort of computation\nfor reconstruction of compressed signals without significant loss of accuracy.\nThe proposed framework has also been validated through adoption by other researchers in their SoC integration efforts.

However, there has been minimal focus on considerations of working with younger children by adopting reflection upon everyday experiences as an integral step to cultivate a healthy life style. The purpose of this study was to introduce digital imaging to young children as a technique to capture, monitor, and reflect upon everyday experiences, thereby supporting children to turn everyday experiences into knowledge about practice, and thus help them improve dietary-related behaviors. A case study design was used within the context of the Bennett Family Center (BFC) Kindergarten, which is housed by the Pennsylvania State University. Five children who enrolled in the BFC participated in the 12 nutrition education sessions during three weeks. A personalized E-portfolio was designed to support children\u00a1\u00afs learning about their unconscious behaviors by visualizing everyday eating experiences in an easily interpretable form, using self-captured digital images. Additionally, a food-train activity was designed to support children to visualize their current eating and to reflect upon them using the food photos that children ate. \nThe results of the study showed that children were able to reflect upon every day experiences and apply proper nutrition knowledge within the proposed interventions. After the reflective activities, children ate more balanced meals across five food groups and made more healthful food choices within the food group. Children reportedly talked more frequently about the foods they were eating and tried to accomplish their goals elicited from the e-portfolio activity to eat more healthily. Children\u00a1\u00afs score of nutrition knowledge about the food guide pyramid increased and about general food healthiness was maintained as high. The findings indicate that the e-portfolio aided children in discovering the discrepancy between expectations and the actual captured data and in being conscious of their eating along with the food-train activity. In this manner, the e-portfolio with self-captured images may have served as an effective learning tool for children to construct new understanding that was linked to behavior changes.  The food-train activity may have amplified those effects as a transfer activity. For future research, involving parents in the reflection activity may benefit children\u00a1\u00afs learning in the long term.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5598], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sunghyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sunghyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan M Land", "Brian K Smith", "George M Graham", "Carla Zembal Saul"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan M Land, Committee Chair", "Brian K Smith, Committee Chair", "George M Graham, Committee Member", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supporting reflection", "representations", "nutrition education", "behavior change", "goal-setting"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Towards Interdisciplinary Perspective of Electronic Negotiation Support Systems\n\n", "id": "7536", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5860", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The principle objective of this research is to develop a prototype for negotiation support systems which aid human negotiators with strategies in electronic negotiation environments.\nNegotiation is a multi-party decision making process and is conceptualized as decision making activities. The negotiation process is also complex in that an overall understanding of all goals, solutions, and their interactions can be extremely entangled. Negotiation complexity affects the various interests in many research fields such as social science, economics, computer sciences and information systems. \nThe field of Negotiation Support Systems (NSS) is also developing a number of innovative research areas and covers a wide range of individual and group decision support technologies. However, many negotiation support systems have not been used in practice negotiation situations because much NSS research has focused on the design and implementation of NSS that often apply little behavioral and economic knowledge.\nIn the past, behavioral issues were largely ignored in NSSs and DSSs, which are based on formal approaches because these systems were designed for the analysts and experts rather than negotiators themselves. Thus, e-negotiation media and support systems necessitate integration of the results of behavioral studies in models proposed in decision theory, game theory, and negotiation analysis. To achieve an interdisciplinary approach, behavioral issues are critical for the adoption of the emerging field of e-negotiations and NSS.\nResearch into experimental games provides theoretical and empirical tools for investigating interactive decision making. These tools provide methods for theory validation as well as information on empirical behavioral regularities that are of potential value to real world decision making. \nFor the research objective, an empirical negotiation game context is introduced as a two-party, distributive (single issue) and incomplete information context with an electronic text-base (i.e., chatting tool) not face-to-face negotiation. Through a descriptive symmetrical test within the provided negotiation context and previous behavioral research review, the negotiation support contents (NSCs) model which has two phases of negotiation process: Preparation and Initial offer phases, is defined. \nTo evaluate the NSCs model, two types of experiments are designed and conducted. One is symmetric descriptive (Type 1) and the other is asymmetric prescriptive/descriptive (Type 2). In the Type 1 experiment, both parties join the experiment without the NSCs. However, only role sellers in the Type 2 experiment join experiment with NSCs, not the role buyer. The compared results of the Type 1 and the Type 2 experiments show that the role sellers\u2019 initial counteroffers in Type 2 are significantly higher than those of the Type 1 sellers. This initial offer behavior of Type 2 sellers affects the final prices which are higher than the Type 1 final prices. \nBased on empirical results, the NSCs model applies to the design of NSS and is an aiding tool for novice negotiators. This study also suggests that a behavioral studies perspective could apply to the design of NSS research and the study suggests a methodology to satisfy the desire for an interdisciplinary perspective in NSS study.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5857], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Sungsoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sungsoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock", "Gary E Bolton", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock, Committee Chair", "Gary E Bolton, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Negotiation Analysis", "Negotiation", "Negotiation Support Systems", "NSS"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PEDAGOGICAL CHALLENGES AND POSSIBILITIES: ADAPTING CRITICAL LITERACY IN EFL COLLEGE WRITING USING A VIDEO-AUTHORING PROJECT \n", "id": "10415", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is a critical action research to explore the pedagogical challenges and possibilities by adapting a critical literacy in an EFL college writing class supported by a video-authoring project.

The hydrogen generation performance of the cobalt PPX-Cl nano thin films (NTFs) was evaluated. Due to the high porosity of the nanostructure of the films, excellent hydrogen generation rates, which are comparable with novel metals, were achieved. \n Cobalt powder (1.6\u00a5\u00ecm dia.) was tested as a catalyst. It was postulated that passive film and re-precipitated film were formed on the cobalt catalyst in alkaline stabilized sodium borohydride solutions. To study the effect of the oxide films on the catalytic activity of the cobalt, ethylenediaminetetra acid (EDTA) was added to the electrolyte and hydrogen generation rates were measured. It was expected that EDTA would effectively suppress the cobalt oxide formation, increasing the hydrogen generation rate. However, the results showed that the hydrogen generation was decreased in the solutions with EDTA. In deaerated solutions, the hydrogen generation rates were increased regardless of the addition of EDTA. These results are explained as a blockage of Co-EDTA chelate, which decreases the absorption of species.\n Evaluation of an aluminum alloy as a catalyst was carried out as a catalyst for sodium borohydride hydrolysis. The effects of EDTA and deaeration were also investigated. The results were opposite to that of cobalt.

Expansins are hypothesized to disrupt non-covalent bonds between cellulose microfibrilis and hemicelluloses or other wall matrix polysaccharides in a non-enzymatic fashion. Land plants typically show acid-induced growth responses mediated by expansins. Auxin activates a proton pump that lowers the apoplast pH of plant cells. Therefore, pH-dependent wall loosening by expansins has been implicated as being important for auxin growth responses of land plants.\nEtiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyls are an excellent system for studying the fundamental processes of cell growth because etiolated hypocotyls are mainly composed of growing primary cell walls. For this reason, I studied endogenous expansin functions particularly with respect to auxin and acid growth responses using etiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyls. \nTo understand the endogenous functions of expansins in-vivo as well as in-vitro, I identified six \u00e1-expansins (EXPA1, EXPA2, EXPA8, EXPA9, EXPA11, and EXPA12) expressed in etiolated Arabidopsis hypocotyls and examined their functional roles for auxin- and acid-growth responses in-vitro and in-vivo.

Based on these results, I conclude that endogenous \u00e1-expansins are required for the normal molecular rearrangements or reorientations of cell wall polymers underlying hypocotyl elongation. Additionally, auxin- and FC-induced growth studies with the transgenic etiolated hypocotyl segments provide the evidence for endogenous \u00e1-expansins stimulating for the in-vivo \u2018acid growth\u2019 responses. \nIn addition, I made two amiRNA constructs to silence most of the Arabidopsis \u00e1-expansins. The constructs were theoretically predicted to suppress 17 \u00e1-expansins. The silencing plants containing the precursor of two pre-amiRNAs showed impaired leaf inclination compared to control plants. This suggests another functional role of \u00e1-expansins, required for normal shading avoidance. \nMoreover, I studied Arabidopsis double mutant (xxt1xxt2), which is defective in xyloglucan (XyG) synthesis, with respect to cell wall mechanical properties. 28-day-old rosette petioles of xxt1xxt2 showed decreased wall elongation in response to acidic buffer and exogenous \u00e1-expansins, compared to wild type. These results suggest that \u00e1-expansins are required for normal cell wall loosening and elongation through disrupting the cellulose-XyG network. Also, results of wall extension assays using seven different wall loosening enzymes or proteins support the conclusion that when cell walls lack XyG, cellulose-xylan and cellulose-pectin networks can take over the main load bearing role, replacing cellulose-XyG.   \nIn my thesis, I drew three major conclusions concerning in-vivo functions of \u00e1-expansins in wall growth; (1) endogenous \u00e1-expansins are required for normal wall growth responses in response to acidic wall pH and auxin in living cells, (2) \u00e1-expansins are necessary for normal shading avoidance, and (3) the cellulose-XyG network, a main substrate of \u00e1-expansins, plays a major role for the extensibility of primary cell walls in Arabidopsis. The main load-bearing structure, however, can be substituted with cellulose-xylan and cellulose-pectin networks, when cell walls have insufficient XyG contents. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6925], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Yong Bum ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yong Bum", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove", "Daniel J Cosgrove", "Hong Ma", "John Edward Carlson", "David Braun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel J Cosgrove, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "David Braun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acid-growth", "Cell wall", "Xyloglucan", "Expansins"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Upper Mantle Seismic Velocity Structure Beneath the Kenya Rift and the Arabian Shield\n", "id": "7715", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6783", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Upper mantle structure beneath the Kenya Rift and Arabian Shield has been investigated to advance our understanding of the origin of the Cenozoic hotspot tectonism found there. A new seismic tomographic model of the upper mantle beneath the Kenya Rift has been obtained by inverting teleseismic P-wave travel time residuals. The model shows a 0.5 \u2013 1.5% low velocity anomaly below the Kenya Rift extending to about 150 km depth. Below ~150 km depth, the anomaly broadens to the west toward the Tanzania Craton, suggesting a westward dip to the structure. \nThe P- and S-wave velocity structure beneath the Arabian Shield has been investigated using travel-time tomography. Models for the seismic velocity structure of the upper mantle between 150 and 400 depths reveal a low velocity region (~1.5% in the P model and ~3% in the S model) trending NW-SE along the western side of the Arabian Shield and broadening to the northeast beneath the MMN volcanic line.  The models have limited resolution above 150 km depth everywhere under the Shield, and in the middle part of the Shield the resolution is limited at all depths. \nRayleigh wave phase velocity measurements have been inverted to image regions of the upper mantle under the Arabian Shield not well resolved by the body wave tomography. The shear wave velocity model obtained shows upper mantle structure above 200 km depth. A broad low velocity region in the lithospheric mantle (depths of &#8804; ~100 km) across the Shield is observed, and below ~150 km depth a region of low shear velocity is imaged along the Red Sea coast and MMN volcanic line. \nA westward dipping low velocity zone beneath the Kenya Rift is consistent with an interpretation by Nyblade et al. [2000] suggesting that a plume head is located under the eastern margin of the Tanzania Craton, or alternatively a superplume rising from the lower mantle from the west and reaching the surface under Kenya [e.g., Debayle et al., 2001; Grand et al., 1997; Ritsema et al., 1999].\nFor the Arabian Shield, the models are not consistent with a two plume model [Camp and Roobol, 1992] because there is a continuous low velocity zone at depths &#8805; 150 km along the western side of the Shield and not separate anomalies. The NW-SE trending low velocity anomaly beneath the western side of the Shield supports the Ebinger and Sleep [1998] model invoking plume flow channeled by thinner lithosphere along the Red Sea coast.\nThe NW-SE low velocity structure beneath the western side of the Shield could also be the northern-most extent of the African Superplume. A low velocity anomaly beneath Ethiopia [Benoit et al., 2006a,b] dips to the west and may extend through the mantle transition zone. The observed low velocities in the upper mantle beneath the Arabian Shield could be caused by hot mantle rock rising beneath Ethiopia and flowing to the north under the Arabian Shield.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6781], "author_name_tesi": "Park, Yongcheol ", "last_name_ssi": "Park", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yongcheol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Charles James Ammon", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Chair", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["surface wave", "body wave", "seismic tomography", "plume"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF THE LEARNING ORGANIZATION, CAREER-ENHANCING STRATEGY, AND WORK ORIENTATION ON THE PROTEAN CAREER: A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF WORKPLACE LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE PRACTITIONERS IN A KOREAN FINANCIAL COMPANY", "id": "8632", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6860", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the learning organization, career-enhancing strategy, and work orientation on the individual\u00a1\u00afs protean career.

Approximately, 1-2% of the US population suff\u000bers from epileptic disorders characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Of these, 25% are uncontrolled by pharmacological treatments. For such patients, alternative therapeutic approaches rely on using stimulation of certain brain regions that can assist in seizure control. Currently used open loop stimulation techniques, such as vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been tested in rodents and humans with some success. Continuous stimulation at regular intervals, such as VNS and DBS can lead to cognitive impairment, brain tissue damage as well as seizure induced epileptogenesis. Hence predicting and preventing seizures seems to be a more favorable approach. Decades of studies have shown that sleep or state of vigilance (SOV) can have an e\u000bffect on seizures. It has been demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and seizure occurrence. It's also been shown that be-\nsides REM state, theta (4-8Hz) associated with Wake state is also epileptic. We use the chronic tetanus toxin (TeTx) rodent model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) to investigate if REM state can be perturbed through sensory stimulation of the\nTrigeminal Ganglion to control seizures. Our results indicate that REM state can be perturbed to control seizures. Fraction of seizures emerging out of stimulated REM state are far lower than REMs that were not stimulated. Since REM state\nwas perturbed and not interrupted, we led to the conclusion that some other dynamic that co-occurs with REM state, makes REM state seizure permissive. Our results also indicated that upon stimulation of the animal during Wake state, when\nhigh theta is present, the fraction of seizures emerging from stimulated wake state\nare also lower compared to un-stimulated Wake state. Hence, stimulation of Wake state during high theta, can also assist in seizure control. Taking these fi\fndings together, from a clinical standpoint, this novel approach of closed-loop stimulation\nbased on SOV detection, can be used to design neuro-modulatory systems to help design better treatment approaches for patients refractory to AEDs for seizure control.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11164], "author_name_tesi": "Parkar, Anjum ", "last_name_ssi": "Parkar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anjum", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Gluckman", "Bruce Gluckman", "Steven Schiff", "Thomas Neuberger", "Kevin Douglas Alloway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Gluckman, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce Gluckman, Committee Chair", "Steven Schiff, Committee Member", "Thomas Neuberger, Committee Member", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seizure control", "seizure prediction", "epilepsy", "closed loop stimulation", "sleep/wake behaviour", "trigeminal nerve stimulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Relationship between neighborhood social capital and built form-\nexplored through the chawls of Mumbai.\n\n", "id": "21224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9824", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rediscovering the fragile thread that links the physical order [architecture] to human behavior will be the main task of this urban age: a world where 75% lives in cities. \n-Georg Simmel.\n\nThis thesis sets out to explore the relationship between spatial design and neighborhood social capital, through the comparative study of the chawls of Mumbai: an industrial housing typology built in the mid- 19th century, and the mid- rises replacing them. The chawls are 3-4 story blocks with one -room tenements and common toilets for its residents. These tenements are often strung together by a common verandah overlooking the central courtyard.\n\nSocial capital at a broader level refers to cognitive and structural benefits based on trust, reciprocity and shared norms embedded in social networks. At the neighborhood level, this could mean cost-reducing and time- saving exchanges between residents such as baby-sitting, job acquisition, information exchange and micro finance. Most importantly, given the increase in crimes against vulnerable populations like the women and the aged in Mumbai, neighborhood social capital, helps harness large -scale collective benefits like visual- policing, crime- prevention, and conflict resolution between residents. \n\nStudies show that for residents to capitalize on pertinent large-scale collective benefits like visual- policing and crime-prevention, they require prior knowledge of each other.  However, sociologists cite contemporary city conditions like long working and/or commuting hours and the advent of technology like the television, internet, and mobile phones, among the many impediments, that leave people with little time to interact or meet their neighbors. As a result, large-scale benefits of neighborhood social capital often go unrealized by the residents. In such a social climate, I believe that spatial design of neighborhoods can be valuable contributors towards orchestrating these social relationships between residents. \n\nThrough the on-site interviews conducted of residents living in both chawls and mid-rises, I learnt that in spite of the above -mentioned impediments to neighborhood social capital, the residents of the chawls knew their neighbors and looked out for each other, incase of emergencies. However, most residents of the mid-rises, earlier residents of the chawls, did not know each other. Interestingly, they depended not on their immediate new neighbors but on their old chawl neighbors living in the same apartment complex, incase of emergencies. For this purpose, I chose to study the spatial design of the chawls and how they contribute towards increased exchanges between the neighbors and thus by that logic, increased social capital.\n\nSpatial elements like the exposed verandahs, the central courtyard and spacious stairways of the chawls allow for increased social contact between chawl residents. This increased social contact induced by spatial design then fosters social exchanges between the neighbors. The spatial arena for interaction gets reduced in size when these exposed verandahs and staircases of the chawls get replaced by inward -looking corridors and enclosed elevators, as the only social spaces in the mid-rises, thus reducing social networks. Provision of these spatial elements as arenas for social contact is the first step towards fostering social contact between residents, but what motivates people to use these common spaces in the first place? In other words, how do the chawls through their spatial design and arrangement, orchestrate movement of people within its common spaces?\n\nIn 2011, 16000 chawls in Mumbai were speculated to eventually be replaced by mid- rises.  It thus becomes important to analyze how spatial design contributes towards strengthening social networks; one of the main benefits being a potentially safer neighborhood. This research intends to provide design lessons and thus inform the city -administration on how to improve design and policy decisions regarding chawl re-development, which is currently focused not on communal design, but on space optimization for economic benefits. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9565], "author_name_tesi": "Parkar, Neha Deepak", "last_name_ssi": "Parkar", "middle_name_ssi": "Deepak", "first_name_ssi": "Neha", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Rebecca Henn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Rebecca Henn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chawls", "mid- rises", "spatial design", "neighborhood social capital and visual policing."]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Age and Sex Differences in Local Vasodilation and Exercise Hyperemia\n\n", "id": "8140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Local alterations in vasodilator responsiveness may significantly influence the leg hyperemic response to dynamic exercise in aging humans in a sex-specific manner.

The purpose of the first study was to compare age differences in brachial and popliteal flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and shear rate in women. Findings suggest that FMD is lower with age in women in both limbs, perhaps due to reductions in smooth muscle responsiveness.  The purpose of the second study was to test the hypothesis that metabolic inhibition of a sympathetic stimulus (i.e., sympatholysis) is reduced with age in the lower extremity vasculature of women. Findings suggest that older women exhibit diminished popliteal artery reactivity and reduced sympatholysis in the leg resistance vasculature.  The purpose of the third study was to test hypothesis that exercise-induced vasodilator responses are greater in young women than men. Findings suggest that the vasodilatory response to dynamic leg exercise is greater in young women vs. men.  The purpose of the fourth study was to test the hypothesis that age by sex interactions in exercising leg hemodynamics persist during small muscle mass exercise that is not limited by cardiac output. Findings suggest that local (non-cardiac) factors underlie the blunted leg vasodilation observed in older women but not older men. The purpose of the fifth study was to test the hypothesis that active muscle oxygen extraction would be higher in older women during knee extensor exercise.  Findings suggest that older women do not compensate for blunted whole limb hyperemia through an augmentation of local oxygen extraction.  These studies provide evidence for alterations in local vasodilator control and blunted leg vasodilation during exercise in older women, which may affect exercise capacity and blood pressure regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [616], "author_name_tesi": "Parker, Beth A.", "last_name_ssi": "Parker", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Beth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr.", "Donna Hope Korzick", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Steven Howard Zarit"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Committee Chair", "William Lawrence Kenney Jr., Committee Member", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Member", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["femoral artery", "leg blood flow", "sex differences", "aging", "leg vascular conductance", "flow-mediated dilation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Examining Race and Ethnicity in Pennsylvania Murder Charge Reductions", "id": "27608", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12119", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite concern about unwarranted racial and ethnic disparity in criminal justice outcomes, little empirical attention has been paid to discretionary case processing decisions made by the prosecutor prior to sentencing.

The basis for evaluating the particle velocity is a Stokes drag law with gravity that represents a simplified variant of the equation of motion for a rigid sphere (Maxey and Riley 1983).  The equilibrium condition, whereby the sum of the forces on the particle is zero, provides an opportunity to reduce computational cost in simulating large numbers of particles.  It is shown that the primary parameter that governs deviation from equilibrium is the product of the particle time constant and the maximum eigenvalue of the velocity gradient tensor.  This parameter is proposed as a redefinition of the Stokes number for particulate flow.  The new Stokes number's effectiveness in predicting departures from equilibrium is demonstrated mathematically and numerically.  The analytical conclusions derived from studying the behavior of a particle under a local flow field are supported by simulations in a variety of analytical flow fields.

Here, I use high-resolution molecular techniques to differentiate individuals, populations, and species within coral symbioses and subsequently quantify the ecological and evolutionary relevance of intraspecific variation.  In the first chapter, I review the technological advances that have made such work possible, and describe preliminary data from several researchers indicating that intraspecific variation may be extensive among coral hosts and symbionts.  In the second chapter, I test the value of manipulating coral-algal partnerships during host larval development for restoration purposes, finding little influence of symbiont identity on growth rates during early ontogeny.

Does news coverage distort economic reality? And, if so, what factors contribute to distortions between economic reality and media coverage? In this dissertation, I examine economic news coverage and test for evidence to support theories that economic news coverage is primarily A) Unbiased and rational, B) Universally ideologically biased in favor of one party or the other, C) Variable ideologically biased depending on the slant of the news outlet D) Institutionally biased due to reporters\u2019 preference for stories that adhere to media norms and values or E) Some combination thereof. I conduct this analysis by collecting and coding an original dataset of unemployment news coverage in nine major news sources over 15 years. The final analysis includes 1,674 articles and nearly 10,000 quotes.\n\nIn Chapter 2, I evaluate the frames journalists use in newspaper headlines. I test the hypotheses that reporters frame similar unemployment situations differently at different points in time due to factors such as political context, electoral proximity, ideology of the president and ideology of the newspaper outlet. After accounting for objective economic conditions, I find evidence for universal ideological bias across newspapers. Reporters write more negative headlines when Republicans control the Whitehouse. I also find several pieces of evidence for institutional bias. First, headlines become disproportionately more negative when unemployment goes up, as compared to when unemployment goes down. And second, the power balance in government affects the way headlines are framed. Headlines are more negative, more likely to be prospective (forward-looking), and less likely to be framed as a surprise when government is divided.\n\nIn Chapter 3, I evaluate the rhetoric reported in unemployment news stories. I once again test the hypotheses that that reporters frame similar unemployment situations differently at different points in time due to factors such as political context, electoral proximity, ideology of the president and ideology of the newspaper outlet. As in Chapter 2, I find ideological bias for more negativity during Republican presidential administrations. I also find evidence that the news media\u2019s institutional preferences for negativity, conflict and novelty all play in role in biasing the reporting of economic rhetoric.\n\nIn Chapter 4, I collect and code a secondary dataset of congressional press releases to analyze how reporters select rhetoric for newspaper articles. I investigate whether the substance of the message or the newsworthiness of the messenger affect the likelihood of media coverage. I test the hypothesis that institutional bias based on reporters\u2019 preferences for balance, authoritative voices, impact, and negativity will lead them to cover certain messages and messengers more heavily. I find little support for institutional bias in the selection of congressional rhetoric. I find that congressional press releases rarely receive media attention, regardless of the message or the messenger.\n\nThis dissertation uncovers systematic differences in how similar economic statistics are reported across contexts. My findings uncover evidence for institutional bias that is strongest when economic news is most negative and when government is divided. I also find that both headlines and reported rhetoric are negative during Republican administrations than during Democratic administrations, regardless of the ideological slant of the particular news outlet.

The World Bank once hailed social capital as the \u201cmissing link\u201d in development practice and research. However, after an initial rush of popularity, it has become more of a fad than a fundamental concept in the field, attracting only a limited amount of research. Among the issues still to be addressed are the multifaceted and multilevel nature of social capital, how it relates to development across a number of developed and developing nations, and how societal characteristics influence levels of social capital. \n\nMy project offers a theoretical and methodological framework within which to examine these issues. Specifically, I investigate how development is related to trust, civic engagement, and neighbor acceptance at both the national and individual levels. National characteristics beyond development are evaluated, such as urbanization, human capital, institutional characteristics, ethnic diversity, and religion. My multilevel approach to social capital also takes into account individual-level characteristics such as education, sex, age, and income. Using a sample of over 67 nations from all major regions of the world, I describe the distribution of social capital across the globe and estimate nation-level OLS regression models. As a final analytic step, I run hierarchical linear models, with countries and individuals as nested levels of data. The primary data source is the World Values Survey; other sources for country-level characteristics include the World Bank, Transparency International, and Polity IV. \n\nResults generally show that trust, civic engagement, and neighbor acceptance are highest in more developed and urbanized nations. However, the different components of social capital have idiosyncratic associations with development. In particular, civic engagement and outcast neighbor acceptance exhibit curvilinear relationships with development, supporting the hypothesis from the modernization perspective that less and more developed nations have higher levels of social capital while nations in the midst of development have lower levels. But trust and diverse neighbor acceptance are positively and linearly related to development, supporting the notion that development leads to a stronger sense of community (i.e., the industrialization perspective). These findings are based on a single-level, aggregate approach to social capital. Utilizing a multilevel approach, I find that social capital is largely a matter of formal institutions. That is, the origin of legal institutions and extent of democracy are the driving forces behind cross-national differences in trust, civic engagement, and neighbor acceptance. These results offer support for treating social capital as a multilevel phenomenon. They also support the claim that the components of social capital should be analyzed separately rather than as a single entity. Finally, more international development research needs to supplement social capital with concepts from research on U.S. communities, such as neighbor acceptance. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7970], "author_name_tesi": "Parks, Michael Jeffrey", "last_name_ssi": "Parks", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee", "D Wayne Osgood", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Kevin J Thomas", "David Shapiro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barrett Alan Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "Kevin J Thomas, Committee Member", "David Shapiro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["International Development", "Social Capital", "Urbanization", "Institutions", "Democracy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF ORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSES TO INFORMATION PRIVACY THREATS IN THE HEALTHCARE CONTEXT", "id": "15206", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proliferation of digitized healthcare holds great promise for sharing medical data, improving healthcare quality, saving patient lives, and reducing costs. However, these potential benefits also draw much attention to the issue of information privacy. In the presence of increasing penalties for non-compliance, reputational loss, and privacy operational issues, organizations must find ways to appropriately respond to privacy threats without impeding healthcare workflow and work practices. Thus, the broad research question examined in this study is:  How do healthcare organizations respond to information privacy threats and issues?\nThis dissertation reports the results of a grounded theory study investigating the organizational responses to information privacy threats. The empirical evidence has been derived from healthcare organizations within the United States of America. The key finding is the emergence of the Privacy Impact Assessment, a central element in the process of effective organizational response to information privacy threats. Assessing the influences and dynamics of different drivers, while simultaneously accounting for the intended (positive impacts) and unintended (negative impacts) consequences is critical to understanding the processes by which organizations respond to privacy threats. The findings are summarized within a theoretical framework of organizational responses to information privacy threats. \nThe theoretical framework developed from this work is stated below:\nThe Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) within healthcare organizations is shaped by a dynamic interplay between privacy threats, organizational drivers, and the Imbalance Challenge. Responding to privacy threats without accounting for the Imbalance Challenge causes potential negative operational impacts to outweigh positive impacts. Therefore, the Privacy Impact Assessment is characterized by the iteration between undertaking a risk assessment of privacy threats and existing drivers, management of privacy safeguards, and evaluation of their impacts. In order to manage this process, healthcare leaders are driven to act proactively and to apply appropriate strategies to accurately assess privacy threats while handling the impact of privacy safeguard enactments on healthcare workflow and work practices. \nThis dissertation makes several contributions to the research literature in information systems, organizational behavior, and health informatics. First, this research provides new theoretical insights into understanding privacy management by targeting the organizational level of analysis through a grounded theory approach. Second, this study responds to a compelling call for research investigating the effectiveness and consequences of enacting privacy safeguards. Moreover, using a grounded theory, this study provides a rich lens to understand the consequences of privacy safeguards enactments and their implications on privacy compliance. Finally, this interdisciplinary study converges the research streams of information systems, organizational behavior, and Health informatics, and promotes synergy between academia and practice by offering practical implications for healthcare practitioners and insights for further theory development. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7493], "author_name_tesi": "Parks, Rachida F", "last_name_ssi": "Parks", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Rachida", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu", "Heng Xu", "Sandeep Purao", "Barbara Louise Gray", "Allen Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Chair", "Heng Xu, Committee Chair", "Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Barbara Louise Gray, Committee Member", "Allen Lee, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["information privacy", "healthcare", "qualitative", "grounded theory", "privacy impact assessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Enumeration of E. coli using DNA Aggregate Forming Units (DAFU) with Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay", "id": "22502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay is a recently developed diagnostic technique used for the presence/absence test of pathogens. Unlike traditional PCR methods, LAMP creates a single-strand loop structure after recognition, amplifies under iso-temperature, and results in a cauliflower-like PCR product. This implies that there is a possibility to grow DNA aggregates by fixing template DNA and LAMP mixture in a polyacrylamide gel, and determine bacterial concentrations by enumerating DNA aggregate forming units (DAFU). Microbial enumeration in wastewater biosolids by Real-Time PCR is limited by the abundance of background DNA that only small amount of template DNA can be used. The aggregate forming unit technique allows a much larger template DNA for analysis and thus lowers the detection limit. The objective of this research, therefore, is to develop a DAFU technique to enumerate Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common indicator for wastewater. Serial dilutions of E. coli DNA were analyzed by both conventional LAMP and the developed DAFU technique with malB gene as the target. The LAMP-DAFU contains the same amount of DNA template, same final concentrations of all LAMP reagents, except with the addition of polyacrylamide, tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), and ammonium persulfate (APS). The result of conventional LAMP versus LAMP-DAFU revealed that the latter technique was able to detect DNA at a lower concentration. This implies that the developed method not only can be used to enumerate E. coli but also can provide better detection sensitivity. Furthermore, quantification of E. coli DNA copies with digital PCR showed the presence of 6.9 \u00d7 105 DNA copies/\u00b5l which is comparable to the result obtained by LAMP-DAFU detection at 6.0 \u00d7 105 DAFU/\u00b5l. Thus, the results showed the developed method has good accuracy for E. coli enumeration. When LAMP-DAFU was performed to amplify E. coli with a background DNA of Pseudomonas, the result implies that 688 or lower E. coli DAFU/g DS can be detected with the developed protocol. Thus, this method has potential to be used for the quantification of Class A biosolids.

That is, given a set of heterogeneous workers, a set of locations, and a set of tasks at each location, the methodology assigns the workers to the different tasks, and routes them through the different locations. All the workers begin and end their route at a depot or home location. This assignment and routing of the workers is done in such a way that a given performance measure is optimized; in this case, the goal is to minimize the makespan. The makespan is defined as the time period from the moment the first worker leaves, and the moment when the last worker returns. The travel times between locations are assumed to be non-trivial, and equal across workers. The proposed PSO approach was implemented on 10 sample problems and the results were compared to those obtained via a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The problems range from three to 10 workers, from two to five tasks per location and from four to 14 locations.\n\nThe results show that the PSO could be potentially implemented to solve these types of problems. PSO was able to find a solution to the sample problems in a shorter time, than that required for the MILP to find the optimal. On average, the computational time was reduced by 60% when utilizing PSO; however, the quality of the solution can be further improved. The PSO heuristic achieved optimal results for five of the 10 problems, while the solution obtained for the remaining five problems was sub-optimal. It is clear that the problem size plays an important role on the behavior of PSO. For larger problems, the algorithm seems to be suffering from stagnation (early convergence). In the future, the performance of the algorithm can be improved by incorporating local search heuristics, as well as a better quality initial swarm. Additionally, some random movement of particles to prevent stagnation could be explored.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9729], "author_name_tesi": "Parra Forero, Carlos Javier", "last_name_ssi": "Parra Forero", "middle_name_ssi": "Javier", "first_name_ssi": "Carlos", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jose Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jose Ventura, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Scheduling", "PSO", "Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Parental attachment and involvement as predictors of high school students' career thoughts", "id": "9244", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study used ordinary least squares multiple regression to examine 10th-, \n11th-, and 12th-grade Career and Technical High (CTC) School students\u2019 gender, student disability, student grade, highest education level of most educated parent, parental attachment, and parental involvement on career thoughts and its constructs of Decision Making Confusion (DMC), Commitment Anxiety (CA), and External Conflict (EC).

However, the baseline total cross sections are often determined from extrapolations of relatively low-temperature viscosity data, reaction probabilities are defined such that experimentally determined equilibrium reaction rates are replicated, and internal energy relaxation models are phenomenological in nature. Therefore, these models have questionable validity in modeling strongly nonequilibrium gases with temperatures greater than those possible in experimental test facilities. To rectify this deficiency, the Molecular Dynamics/Quasi-Classical Trajectories (MD/QCT) method can be used to accurately compute total collision cross sections, reaction probabilities, and internal energy exchange models based on first principles for hypervelocity collision conditions. In this thesis, MD/QCT-based models were used to improve simulations of two unique nonequilibrium rarefied gas systems: the Ionian atmosphere and hypersonic shocks in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \n\nThe Jovian plasma torus flows over Io at \u2248 57 km/s, inducing high-speed collisions between atmospheric SO2 and the hypervelocity plasma\u2019s O atoms and ions. The DSMC method is well-suited to model the rarefied atmosphere, so MD/QCT studies are therefore conducted to improve DSMC collision models of the critical SO2-O collision pair. The MD/QCT trajectory simulations employed a new potential energy surface that was developed using a ReaxFF fit to a set of ab initio calculations. Compared to the MD/QCT results, the baseline DSMC models are found to significantly underpredict total cross sections, use reaction probabilities that are unrealistically high, and give unphysical internal energies above the dissociation energy for non-reacting inelastic collisions and under-predicts post-dissociation SO internal energy. Implemented into DSMC, the MD/QCT-based models had a significant effect on simulations of simple, thermal nonequilibrium heat bath and 2D counterflow cases approximating the upper atmospheric conditions of Io. In high-fidelity 1D simulations of the atmosphere of Io, the MD/QCT models predicted approximately half the SO2 atmospheric dissociation due to O and O+ bombardment and a temperature rise due to plasma heating further from the Ionian surface than the existing baseline methodologies. \n\nHypersonic spacecraft re-entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere experience significant heating from the post-shock gas. The DSMC method is used to model hypersonic shocks during the early stages of re-entry because of the rarefied nature of the atmosphere at high altitudes. Improved modeling of the N-N2 and N2-N2 collision pairs are thus generated with MD/QCT. For the N-N2 pair, a potential energy surface developed at NASA Ames is used and, for the N2-N2 pair, a new potential energy surface is developed using a ReaxFF fit to recent advanced ab initio computations. The MD/QCT-computed total cross sections agreed well with the baseline models, but the MD/QCT reaction probabilities exhibited better physical behavior, a stronger dependence on initial molecular internal energy, and were generally lower than the baseline DSMC chemistry models for strong nonequilibrium conditions, but higher for equilibrium conditions. Furthermore, the MD/QCT results predicted faster rotational-translational energy relaxation for the N-N2 pair and faster vibrational-translational energy relaxation for the N2-N2 pair. The MD/QCT models were tested in DSMC simulations of 2D axisymmetric hypersonic flow over a blunt body and thermal nonequilibrium heat bath cases. The MD/QCT models led to increased post-shock N2 dissociation and faster rates of internal energy relaxation, each of which led to corresponding decreases in translational temperature.

At high current densities, excessive amount of water is generated and condenses, blocking the pores of porous electrodes with liquid water, limiting the reactant transport to active catalyst. This phenomenon, known as \u201cflooding\u201d becomes the limiting mechanism of PEFC performance. In order to predict flooding and its effects on PEFC performance, first a theory of liquid water transport in these porous electrodes, namely gas diffusion media (GDM) is developed, and effects of porous structure and wettability, such as bi-layer construction, is analyzed. Two-phase heat transfer in GDM is also investigated. Based on this understanding, a multi-dimensional, multi-component, two-phase mathematical model is developed. The model accounts for simultaneous two-phase flow, transport of species, and electrochemical kinetics. Multiphase mixture (M) formulation is then utilized to efficiently model the two-phase transport in the porous electrodes. Governing equations are developed using a single domain formulation, generating a single set of governing equations valid for all components of PEFC. The resulting governing equations are solved with a finite-volume based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, using a general-purpose commercial CFD software.\nThe proposed model investigates PEFC behavior under various operating conditions, primarily exploring the two-phase flow physics in the cathode GDM. Multidimensional simulations reveal that flooding of porous cathode decreases oxygen transport rate to the cathode catalyst layer and causes a substantial increase in cathode polarization. Furthermore, the humidification level of reactant streams and the inlet flow rates are found to be key parameters controlling PEFC performance, two-phase flow and transport characteristics. It is found that minimization of specific performance limitations such as dry-out and flooding depends upon not only material characteristics but also the optimization of these operating parameters.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6377], "author_name_tesi": "Pasaogullari, Ugur ", "last_name_ssi": "Pasaogullari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ugur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Ali Borhan", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Matthew M Mench"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PEFC", "flooding", "two-phase", "GDL", "MPL", "modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "When faith hurts: Stigma, social identity threat, and religion", "id": "27121", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Members of four religious groups in the United States completed an online survey designed to assess predictors and consequences of religious stigma and the effects of an experimental identity threat manipulation.

Results reveal that religious stigma was higher among religious minorities (i.e., Muslims and Jews) compared to Christians (i.e., Protestants and Catholics) and among people who are more religious.

Currently used techniques do not allow for the testing of MOSFETs in their native mode of operation and are often not suitable for measuring production devices and require special test structures.  Since MOSFETs are fully dynamical systems, the best course of action for extraction of information about their current health state is in the evaluation of fully dynamical data sets.\n\nThe first developed technique is an adaptation of the well known charge pumping (CP)  technique.  We have modified traditional CP, which utilizes substrate current measurement to determine Si-SiO2 interface traps in MOSFETs, to enable its application to MOSFETs with no substrate contacts by using the drain current.  This latter type of MOSFETs includes those used in CMOS, thin-film, and nanowire transistors.  These transistors are all three-terminal devices and our CP adaptation is, therefore, referred to as three-terminal charge pumping (3TCP).  The efficacy of 3TCP was evaluated and it showed excellent agreement with both traditional charge pumping measurements, and transfer characteristic measurements.  While 3TCP is a step towards the use of dynamical response to gate stimulus, it still employs quasi-static measurements of the net current flow through the MOSFETs. \n\nTo transition into a fully dynamical analysis of MOSFET degradation, one must move beyond traditional characterization techniques which are limited to quasi-static approaches.  In this work we have developed a technique to characterize the health state of MOSFETs through the extraction of degradation metrics is based upon the transient response of the drain to source current, Ids, to a step input to the gate of the device.    This Ids response is analyzed by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to determine eigen-transients of the system.  We refer to this technique  as degradation assessment via eigen-transient analysis (DAVETA).  We observe that DAVETA produces a measure of device degradation that is much more sensitive than quasi-static methods.  More importantly, however, DAVETA is able to track the evolution of MOSFET degradation in real time and while the device is in its normal mode of operation, which makes it possible to predict remaining time to failure.  We have applied DAVETA to study degradation measured in u-shaped vertical MOSFETs and planar MOSFETs, as well as MOSFET degradation obtained from simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) simulation experiments.\n\nWe found excellent agreement between DAVETA's results and those of traditional quasi-static experiments.  We also show from SPICE simulations that DAVETA is capable of distinguishing between different degradation mechanisms in response to an identical gate stimulus offering the possibility of developing a single tracker to distinguish multiple failure modes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3757], "author_name_tesi": "Passmore, Lucas Jay", "last_name_ssi": "Passmore", "middle_name_ssi": "Jay", "first_name_ssi": "Lucas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Samia A Suliman", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim, Dissertation Advisor", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Chair", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Chair", "Samia A Suliman, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["semiconductor", "pca", "health monitoring", "mosfet", "reliability", "mos", "dynamic"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Language and culture learning abroad: Mediating pre-service World Languages teachers' development of interculturality", "id": "24825", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10887", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The development of intercultural understanding and the ability to interact appropriately and effectively with people from other cultures has become extremely important in today\u2019s globalized, multilingual world.

The study also attempts to fill a gap in the existing research by looking specifically at learners\u2019 processes of development during study abroad, as opposed to the results, and how mediation that is focused and systematic mediation might impact that development.\n\nUsing qualitative data from students\u2019 written responses to blog prompts and classmate and facilitator feedback as well as other assignments and activities, this study looks at the different types and foci of the mediation provided by the course structure and how those worked together to help students in the process of developing interculturality. The study also looks at two case studies to examine how different students experience their time aboard, how they engage with particular mediational foci and how that engagement with the mediation might impact their development.\n\nThe study illustrates how both the structural and dialogic elements of the course work together to mediate students\u2019 experiences and their intercultural learning and development. It also illustrates the importance, for their processes of development, of the ways in which students engage with mediation offered toward their understanding of language use, communication, and culture and toward their abilities to move beyond emotional responses to analytical ones and to make connections between and across the variety of experiences that they have while abroad.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10479], "author_name_tesi": "Pasterick, Michelle Le", "last_name_ssi": "Pasterick", "middle_name_ssi": "Le", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Elizabeth A Smolcic", "Celeste S Kinginger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Edward Poehner, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Elizabeth A Smolcic, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["world languages", "interculturality", "study abroad", "foreign language", "intercultural competence"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Inflammatory mediator-induced dysregulation of colorectal carcinogenic pathways\n", "id": "11281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1501", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the U.S.  Although CRC is associated with a lifetime risk of 5-6% in the general population, this risk is increased in those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is influenced by severity, extent and duration of disease.  The inflammation seen in IBD is partly the consequence of the collective actions of various cytokines, of which tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) are arguably the most important.  Although chronic inflammation has been linked to carcinogenesis, little is known regarding the effect of its mediators on tumor suppressors and proto-oncogenes in IBD-related CRC.  The first objective of the research presented herein was to investigate the effects of TNFalpha and IFNgamma on the apoptotic intermediaries p53 and p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), as dysregulation of the p53 pathway is typical in CRC.  \n     The in vitro study of principal CRC-related signaling pathways relies heavily on the use of cultured cells.  The most well-known and repeatedly used established cell lines in public repositories have been maintained for decades.  Since long-term cell culture predisposes to spontaneous mutagenesis and altered morphological and behavioral features, a need for novel, characterized cell lines to enrich the current experimental model is necessary.  Therefore, the second objective of the discussed research was to develop and characterize novel CRC lines, as well as to compare their microRNA (miRNA) and protein expression profiles to those of the tissue from which they were derived to assess the degree of reliability of these cell lines in their representation of their progenitor tissue.  \n     We have shown that TNFalpha and IFNgamma upregulated PUMA in a p53-independent manner and that this upregulation was synergistic and corresponded to apoptotic activity.  These cytokine-induced effects suggest that TNFalpha and IFNgamma may serve protective roles, rather than those promoting tumorigenesis, in CRC.  We have also established and characterized four cell lines from fresh CRC tissue.  A weak to moderate degree of correlation was demonstrated for miRNA and protein expression profiles between the cell lines and their respective progenitor tissue, while expression levels between the four cell lines, themselves, exhibited a strong level of agreement.  Though our cell lines possess distinct features from their tissues of origin, overall, they retain similar miRNA and protein expression, rendering them acceptable for use in studies of cancer biology.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1486], "author_name_tesi": "Pastor, Danielle  Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Pastor", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Danielle ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa S Poritz", "Mary Judith Tevethia", "Timothy Ritty", "H Paul Ehrlich", "Charles H Lang", "Lisa S Poritz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa S Poritz, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Judith Tevethia, Committee Member", "Timothy Ritty, Committee Member", "H Paul Ehrlich, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Lisa S Poritz, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["colorectal cancer", "inflammatory bowel disease", "interferon gamma", "tumor necrosis factor", "PUMA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE INSTRUCTIONAL EFFECTS OF DIAGRAMS AND TIME-COMPRESSED INSTRUCTION ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND LEARNERS\u2019 PERCEPTIONS OF COGNITIVE LOAD\n\n\n\n", "id": "9777", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5327", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of visual representations and time-compressed instruction on learning and learners\u2019 perceptions of cognitive load. Time-compressed instruction refers to instruction that has been increased in speed without sacrificing quality. It was anticipated that learners would be able to gain a conceptual understanding of technical material at normal and moderately compressed (25%) speeds while instruction presented at 50% compression would depresses it. Visual representations (images/diagrams) have been shown to support learning from a multimedia environment when presented with verbal representations. Thus, it was anticipated that visuals would support learning in a time-compressed environment. \nThis study employed 216 undergraduate students from a medium sized university in a 2x3 factorial design. The independent variables were visuals (visual, no-visual) and compression rates (0%, 25%, 50%). Participants listened to audio instruction of the heart and those in the visuals condition also viewed 19 diagrams that corresponded to the verbal instruction. The dependent variables consisted of four achievement tests: drawing, identification, terminology, and comprehension.  Total test, Review Behaviors (back and replay buttons), time-on-task, and perceptions of cognitive load served as additional dependent variables. Prior knowledge of biology was also measured and considered for use as a covariate.\nOverall, scores on the knowledge-based posttest measures indicate that learning is not significantly affected at the 25% rate, but it is depressed at the 50% compression rate. Participants who listened to compressed instruction at the 50% rate obtained lower scores on the total, drawing, and identification tests than did those in who listened to either uncompressed instruction or instruction at the 25% compression rate. There was also an affect of visuals on learning. Participants who viewed visuals obtained higher scores than those who did not view visuals for the total, drawing, identification, and terminology tests. Additionally, there was visual by compression interaction for the comprehension test, which indicated that at 25% compression, high-level knowledge is depressed unless visuals are presented.  \nThe cognitive load measure indicated that normal and moderately compressed (25%) instruction use a similar amount of cognitive load, however this is increased at 50%.  Participants who viewed visuals indicated they used less cognitive load than did those participants who were not presented visuals. Although participants could review the material, the uncompressed version took the greatest amount of time. The 25% compression group took longer than the 50% compression group.\nIn sum, the results of this study indicate that listening to normal or moderately compressed (25%) instruction in a multimedia environment supports learning.  At these speeds, cognitive load is not increased thus allowing learners to gain a conceptual understanding of the material.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5322], "author_name_tesi": "Pastore, Raymond ", "last_name_ssi": "Pastore", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raymond", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Mary Land", "Peggy Noel Van Meter", "Susan M Land", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "Brian Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Mary Land, Dissertation Advisor", "Peggy Noel Van Meter, Committee Chair", "Susan M Land, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Member", "Brian Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Audio", "Visuals", "Time-Compressed", "Multiple Representations", "Multimedia"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Investigations into tangential finger force coordination", "id": "6304", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6144", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tangential force (Ft) coordination has received little explicit attention in the human prehension literature.  Ft are those forces exerted parallel to the surface of a grasped object, and are often the functional forces (e.g. holding a glass of water).  Because they are necessary for mechanical equilibrium, and because of their under-study, this dissertation explores Ft in multiple experimental and computational settings.  Adopted methods were similar to those used in other prehension studies, but unique experimental manipulations allowed for a 'fishing expedition' approach to the problem of understanding Ft coordination.  Six experiments were conducted that examined factors relevant to Ft coordination including: (1) Viscoelastic relaxation of the finger pad subjected to Ft load, (2) Interaction among fingers during maximal multi-finger Ft efforts, (3) Ft performance during a pressing task, (4) The response of Ft to variations in external load magnitude and direction during multi-finger grasping, (5) Mechanically optimal finger forces for non-vertically oriented grasped objects, and (6) Finger pad strain energy minimization as a control scheme for intra-finger normal-tangential force coordination.  The results are somewhat disparate in their immediate implications, but are all necessary facts to consider when formalizing hypotheses regarding Ft control.  The following hypotheses were developed: (1) Minimization of effort drives inter-finger force coordination, and (2) Minimization of strain energy in the contact region of the finger pad drives intra-finger coordination.  These hypotheses are intuitive, have a physiological basis, and are supported by the current data.

Low maternal responsiveness in particular has been identified as a factor present across many disorders that involved maladaptive parenting such as child maltreatment. Although maternal responsiveness has proven to be a potent predictor, it may only give insight into part of the family. Little research has examined the utility of maternal responsiveness in predicting maltreatment in comparison to bidirectional dyad-based measures of conflict, disengagement, and intrusiveness. Such a question is important to considering whether child maltreatment is best conceptualized as a parental pathology or the extreme of familial dysfunction. An examination of dyssynchrony between mothers and children in at-risk populations during difficult, but normative parenting tasks was conducted to further inform our understanding of family interactions in high-stress situations. The present study examined the possible unique association between dyadic dyssynchrony and maltreatment history. This study replicated previous findings associating higher parental burden with decreased parent-child interaction quality as measured by maternal responsiveness and dyadic dyssynchrony. The dyads with mother perpetrated maltreatment did in fact demonstrate lower responsiveness and higher dyadic dyssynchrony, but there was not any evidence of an interaction effect contrary to predictions. Finally, it was found that dyadic dyssynchrony was associated with maltreatment status even after accounting for the contributions of maternal responsiveness. This study provides preliminary support for the utilization of dyadic dyssynchrony in observational studies as a more proximal measure of parenting and family risk.

Analyzing social networks has helped in the detection and prevention of various security threats that exploit vulnerabilities of applications that rely on them.  Moreover, understanding interesting communication patterns and correlations within the social network has helped in formulating efficient search and information dispersion algorithms. This thesis addresses security and search issues in social networks.  The first part concentrates on the detection and prevention of security threats such as spam in IP enabled voice carrying social networks. In the second part, we propose techniques to perform search in unstructured social networks. The proposed techniques rely on overlapping group memberships, i.e., group correlations in such networks. Finally in the concluding part, we briefly discuss ongoing work in one of the most serious security threats today, called botnets. \n\nAs the data carrying capacity of IP-based networks has increased, it is now possible to migrate voice communication over them while still maintaining the required Quality of Service (QoS). Though this has dramatically decreased the cost of a telephone conversation compared to a traditional land line, an unfortunate side effect has been that it has attracted attention of spammers who send pre-recorded messages in bulk constituting a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on legitimate users on the network. Also the lack of adequate pre-screening techniques has further exacerbated this problem. In this thesis, we present a voice spam filtering method that relies on social networks.  Further we also evaluate this technique with a centralized SIP based model. \n\nSuccess of any social-networking based application relies on the efficiency of search. Social networks have to perform search in a distributed manner, i.e., search in social networks is typically performed either using flooding or Random Walk (RW). Flooding has the tendency to generate exponential network traffic, while RW can potentially take a long time to conclude. In this thesis, we propose a refined search technique based on correlated communities or subgroups which whenever possible, relies on restricting search to peers that belong to communities that might be highly correlated with the requested community. Further we analytically and experimentally prove that our proposed technique indeed outperforms RW. \n\nNot all social networks are formed as a result of explicit human interaction and certainly not all of them are beneficial to the user. Anti-social botnets are networks of comprised hosts all controlled by a single entity called the botmaster. A host can get infected with a bot as a result of a variety of social engineering techniques such as receiving an infected greeting card from a known associate or accidentally visiting a web page infected with the bot code. Botnets are considered one of the most serious security threats today. We conclude the thesis with a survey of some of the proposed techniques for detecting and preventing the spread of botnets. We also discuss our ongoing work in this context. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4850], "author_name_tesi": "Patankar, Pushkar Deepak", "last_name_ssi": "Patankar", "middle_name_ssi": "Deepak", "first_name_ssi": "Pushkar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "George Kesidis", "Chitaranjan Das", "Sencun Zhu", "David Jonathan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Dissertation Advisor", "George Kesidis, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Networks", "Peer-to-Peer Systems", "Unstructured Networks", "Botnets"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Common Pokeweed (Phytolacca americana L.)

It has become a frequent problem in agronomic crops in Pennsylvania. Traditionally, plowing was used to manage pokeweed; however, the wide-spread adoption of conservation tillage, a decline in the use of soil residual herbicides, and a decrease in diverse cropping rotations may have allowed pokeweed populations to increase in recent years. This research was conducted in order to identify opportunities to better manage pokeweed in corn, soybean, and other Northeast U.S. cropping rotations and shows that an integrated approach which includes both cultural and chemical tactics enables successful management of pokeweed in conservation tillage systems.\nExperiments were conducted in order to investigate the biology of common pokeweed in order to better time control tactics. In a pokeweed seedling emergence timing experiment, seedlings emerged throughout the summer, but peak emergence occurred in mid to late May. By August, pokeweed seedling emergence ceased. Both above- and below-ground pokeweed biomass decreased with delayed emergence and plants which emerged in late July did not produce mature berries by the end of the season. Experiments were also conducted to assess herbicide efficacy on pokeweed control. In corn, glyphosate, plant growth regulators, and other herbicides provided at least 80% control in trials conducted over a 3-year period. In soybean, glyphosate provided the best control of pokeweed; all treatments including glyphosate provided at least 80% control, while non-glyphosate treatments provided less than 62% control. Other glyphosate experiments examined herbicide rate, nozzle selection, carrier volume, and application timing. Air induction and flat fan nozzles provided the same level of control and in one of two years, 93 L/ha carrier provided better control than greater carrier volumes. The highest rates of 1.27 and 1.73 kg ae/ha provided the best control 12 weeks after application (WAA), but at 44 WAA, there was no difference in control due to glyphosate rate. Glyphosate application after mid-June provided better control than earlier in the summer. Even though pokeweed is a challenging weed to control, the results from this research show that there are options for controlling pokeweed in Pennsylvania field crops. Understanding the emergence pattern and current herbicide options has provided insight on how to better time control tactics and reduce this problematic weed. In order to control pokeweed, an integrated approach must be taken.

In this study, dough was baked at 219 \u00baC by using different ovens (conventional, impingement or hybrid) and with different dough weight (520g or 80g) for varying times. During baking the temperature profile at the dough center was recorded. The texture, thermal properties and pasting characteristics of baked products with reference to baking conditions were investigated. Small breads baked in the hybrid oven had the highest heating rate (25.1 \u00baC/min) while large breads baked in conventional oven had the lowest heating rate (6.0 \u00baC/min). When data were evaluated as a function of heating rate in this study, the enthalpy of amylopectin recrystallization, rate of bread firmness development and the amount of soluble amylose were lower at the slower heating rate. The differences observed in product firmness following storage are potentially a consequence of the extent of starch granule hydration, dispersion and the extent of amylose reassociation; all of which are affected by the heating rate during baking.\n\nStructural attributes of the baked goods are mainly determined by the gelatinized starch granules, which form the basis for the second study. The changes in starch granule hydration and dispersion were followed visually by using a hot stage microscopy and at a molecular level by using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Hot stage microscopy revealed changes in starch granule morphology and size during heating at either 5 or 25 \u00baC/min when monitored continuously. The results showed that granule morphology was different as a function of the heating rate and granule swelling was governed kinetically. These observations visually demonstrated the significant influence of processing conditions, i.e., heating rate, on starch granule size and morphology; and therefore potentially have implications in determining structure and texture of baked products.\n\nThe changes observed visually in starch granules indicate the potential difference in the gelatinization process of the starch granules. The visual changes observed by microscopy were further investigated using the DSC at molecular level. Differential Scanning Calorimeter tracked the processes of starch gelatinization and retrogradation at molecular levels in terms of peak temperature and enthalpy of endothermic events associated with gelatinization as well as retrogradation. The effect of heating rate on baked product structure, texture and firmness development following storage has been reported. However, the differences in the mechanistic processes occurring during starch gelatinization, as a function of heating rate, are unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of heating rate at different moisture contents on starch retrogradation and gelatinization processes. Starch suspensions at a water: starch ratio of 0.7 or 2.0 were heated by using a DSC at heating rates between 5 \u00b0C/min and 40 \u00b0C/min for the retrogradation study. The thermal profiles were evaluated, as a function of heating rate, and the retrogradation behavior following storage were also determined. The effect of heating rate was not evident on the retrogradation behavior of starch suspensions at either moisture content. To determine the effects of heating rate on starch-water interactions, starch suspensions at a water:starch ratio ranging from 0.7 to 3.0 were heated at 5, 15 or 25 \u00b0C/min by using a DSC to different final temperatures and rescanned. The deconvoluted G and M1 endotherms and the corresponding additional unfrozen water (AUW) were determined. The results showed that the G and M1 endotherms merged at higher heating rates and at higher moisture contents. A significant interaction was observed between moisture content and heating rate demonstrating that the gelatinization process was governed by moisture content at the lower heating rates and by heating rate at the higher heating rates. Results from the AUW data suggest that the M1 component of gelatinization dominated at lower moisture content and lower heating rates. However, at higher moisture contents, an interaction was observed between moisture content and heating rate. The data suggest that at higher moisture content and at higher heating rate, there is still a kinetic limitation to the complete melting of the M1 endotherm. All these results support the premise that baking process can be a potential tool in developing the baked product quality and shelf life. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [706], "author_name_tesi": "Patel, Bhavesh K", "last_name_ssi": "Patel", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Bhavesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Koushik Seetharaman", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Edward William Mills", "Ralph D Waniska"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Koushik Seetharaman, Committee Chair", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Member", "Edward William Mills, Committee Member", "Ralph D Waniska, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["baking process", "starch retrogradation", "starch gelatinization", "heating rate"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF GLASS/POLYCARBONATE INTERFACE FOR COMPOSITE MATERIALS APPLICATION\n\n\n\n", "id": "8139", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5208", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Glass fiber composites have tremendous success in industrial applications because they provide a light weight, high performance, polymer based alternative to other materials for certain uses. Glass fiber composites exploit the mechanical performance of the glass, paired with the light weight nature of the polymer. During industrial processing, glass fibers are easily incorporated into the polymer matrix using conventional mechanical processes such as extrusion or are incorporated as a mesh. As with any composites, the interface between the polymer and the glass play a vital role in determining the mechanical properties of the final material. Commercially, the glass surface is manipulated by using silane coupling agents that bond covalently to the surface. Although glass fibers are now widely used, there is little understanding about the interface between the glass fibers and most polymer matrices. Many scientists have attempted to study the interface by performing micromechanical tests between a single fiber and the polymer matrix. One such test is known as the single fiber pullout test. In this study, the pullout test is employed to study the interface between polycarbonate and glass fibers that have been treated with different silanes. Furthermore, the respective composites with 10 wt% glass fibers in polycarbonate are tested for their mechanical properties (the glass fibers used here were also treated with the same silanes as in the pullout tests). The results from the pullout tests show consistency with theoretical arguments, and correlate to the composites tests.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5183], "author_name_tesi": "Patel, Romesh J", "last_name_ssi": "Patel", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Romesh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Evangelos Manias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor", "Evangelos Manias, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polycarbonate", "glass fibers", "pullout test"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Electrochemically Deposited Poly(thiophene)s And Their Composites With Carbon Nanotubes And Fullerenes", "id": "12533", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13276", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bulk heterojunctions of conducting polymers and fullerenes (as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) have been particularly successful as active layers in organic photovoltaics, however, the currently employed randomly oriented heterojunction morphology has to be reevaluated if organic photovoltaics are to be commercialized for widespread use. To that end, electropolymerization has been used to create dense composites of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs) with carbon nanotubes and PCBM to\nfacilitate exploration of the properties of new bulk heterojunctions with preferential alignment of the thiophene rings parallel to the electrode surface. In conventional, solution-processed P3ATs, the thiophene ring alignment is governed by the interactions between the alkyl side chain and the substrate, which directs charge mobility along the substrate plane. On the other hand, electrochemically grown polymer chains exhibit inplane orientation of their monomer units. This orientation with monomers stacked normal to the electrode surface can facilitate broad absorbance and promote charge transport to the active layer/electrode interface. The optical properties of the e-P3HT films were tuned by modifying the stacking orientation of the electrodeposited monomers. Crystals oriented in the (100) direction (thiophene rings perpendicular to substrate) were found in e-P3HT and regioregular, solution cast P3HT, however, orientation in the (010) direction (thiophene rings parallel to substrate) was only present in e-P3HT. This in-plane stacking of the e-P3HT resulted in a broader optical absorbance; however, the lack of long-range conjugation caused a blueshift in the absorbance maximum compared to rr-P3HT. Raman spectroscopy revealed that despite these stacking and conjugation differences, \u00c3\u00b0-\u00c3\u00b0 interactions in e-P3HT were comparable to those in regioregular P3HT and significantly higher than in regiorandom P3HT.\nThe degree of stacking in e-P3HT depended on the applied polymerization potential as well as polymerization time, and an increase in either of these deposition parameters was detrimental to the degree of stacking and the electrical properties of the films. At high polymerization potentials, the faster rate of polymerization does not allow for adequate orientation of the thiophene ring at the growing surface, resulting in a film with more disorder than a film that is deposited slowly. Thick films that were grown for\nlong times showed increased disorder compared to thin films grown under the same conditions. Films that were electrodeposited slowly (at 1 mA cm-2) for a short amount of time (90 s) resulted in a stronger (010) x-ray diffraction peak and lower photoluminescence intensity compared to films that were polymerized at higher current\ndensity (fast deposition).\nElectropolymerization affords the deposition of thin polymer films that are normally insoluble as chemically synthesized polymers, eliminating the need of solubility enhancers, such as alkyl side chains, that do not contribute to the performance of the polymers. As such, the optical and electrical properties of poly(3-methylthiophene) (e-P3MT) were observed to be superior to those of e-P3HT, showing improvements by at least an order of magnitude in conductivity and by as much as three-orders in mobility compared to films of e-P3HT. Furthermore, the absorptivity and field-effect mobility of e-P3MT was much higher than that of e-P3HT, and similar to that of rr-P3HT. With the added benefit of a facile fabrication method over solution processed polymers, e-P3MT was further considered as a replacement for rr-P3HT in bulk heterojunction active layers.\nFinally, thiophene monomers were electrodeposited within carbon nanotube mats\non fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) to form dense e-P3HT/CNT composites. Scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the polymer was infused throughout the thickness of the CNT mat, resulting in a composite film with a highly dense CNT network. The e-P3HT/CNT composites exhibited photoluminescence\nquenching with increasing CNT density, providing evidence of charge transfer from the polymer phase to the CNT phase. Higher conductivity and mobilities were also observed in the composite films. Binary and tertiary composites of e-P3MT, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes were electrochemically deposited into photovoltaic geometries to test their photovoltaic response, demonstrating the promise of this method as a cost and time saving way for device fabrication.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12823], "author_name_tesi": "Patel, Romesh J", "last_name_ssi": "Patel", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Romesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Hickner", "Tse-Chiang Chung", "Ralph Colby", "Enrique Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Hickner, Committee Chair", "Tse-Chiang Chung, Committee Member", "Ralph Colby, Committee Member", "Enrique Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conducting polymers", "Organic solar cells", "Electropolymerization."]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "REGULATION OF GENE TRANSCRIPTION BY THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR \u2013NEW TARGETS AND MECHANISMS OF REGULATION.", "id": "8497", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5152", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adaptation in response to changes in internal as well as external environment is imperative to sustenance of life. Modulation of gene expression is a critical component of this adaptive response and is mediated by activation of various transcription factors. Individual signaling pathways have been well characterized for many transcription factor systems. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor that is activated by a variety of structurally diverse ligands, including the environmental contaminant dioxin, the cigarette smoke constituent benzo[a]pyrene and the therapeutically prescribed drug omeprazole. Prior to activation, AHR is primarily located in a cytoplasmic complex with chaperone and co-chaperone proteins. Ligand-binding is believed to initiate a conformational change that leads to nuclear translocation, dissociation from the chaperones and heterodimerization with AHR-nuclear translocator (ARNT). AHR-ARNT heterodimer recognizes and binds to a consensus DNA sequence (TNGCGTG), commonly referred to as a dioxin response element (DRE), to drive transcription of target genes. Phase I and II xenobiotic metabolism enzymes have been the well-characterized targets of AHR-mediated transactivation. This sequence of coordinate events has been described as the classical pathway of AHR activity. Different lines of evidence suggest that AHR serves physiologically relevant functions, though the details have not been elucidated. The goal of this research project was to identify previously uncharacterized targets of AHR-mediated gene regulation and to investigate the hypothesis that AHR functions through mechanisms that are independent of DNA-binding. The advances in performing genome-wide transcriptional profiling at the time of commencement of this project, encouraged the use of DNA-microarray technology for identifying new target genes. Epiregulin, a potent mitogen belonging to the epidermal growth factor family, was discovered to be regulated by AHR in immortalized murine hepatocytes. The fact that a number of AHR ligands have been associated with carcinogenesis signifies that the induction of growth factors like epiregulin might be a potential mechanism for AHR-mediated tumor enhancement. The next phase of this project led to the identification of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), another receptor involved in drug metabolism, as an in vivo target of AHR activation. This association between AHR-CAR highlights the possibility of crosstalk between AHR and other pathways. Exposure to divergent stimuli leads to simultaneous activation of multiple signaling pathways. This suggests that it is essential to study the networking of various pathways to be able to predict the biological outcomes. The third phase of this project focuses on the ability of AHR to modulate the inflammatory pathway and on the involved mechanism. AHR activation can repress the acute-phase response (APR) gene expression, implicated in disorders like septic shock and Alzheimer\u2019s, partly by antagonizing NF-\u00eaB mediated gene regulation through a non-classical mechanism not involving DRE. Serum amyloid family members, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin were found to be repressed by AHR, signifying that AHR regulates multiple members of the APR. Thus, this research has led to the identification of multiple AHR-regulated genes. It also presents a model to study AHR-mediated gene repression, an aspect that has therapeutic potential.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5124], "author_name_tesi": "Patel, Rushang Dilipkumar", "last_name_ssi": "Patel", "middle_name_ssi": "Dilipkumar", "first_name_ssi": "Rushang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Robert Bruce Mitchell", "Naomi S Altman", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew, Committee Chair", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Robert Bruce Mitchell, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aryl hydrocarbon receptor", "Dioxin", "Inflammation", "Toxicology", "Nuclear receptor", "Gene regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Diabetes and Experimental Stroke: Early Pathophysiology in the db/db mouse", "id": "13753", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5552", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Diabetes is associated with an increased vulnerability to stroke and increased morbidity/mortality following a stroke.  Although increased risk of stroke is attributable to increased rates of atherosclerosis, there is no well-established single mechanism explaining the poorer stroke recovery observed in diabetics.  In animal models, diabetic db/db mice exhibit larger infarct volumes relative to their non-diabetic db/+ littermates following a cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult.  It was recently found that the enhanced morbidity in the diabetic db/db mice was associated with increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity.  In other experimental models of stroke, neutrophils are considered to be a source of MMP-9 and BBB breakdown.  The overall objective of this thesis was to determine the role of neutrophil infiltration on stroke recovery in the brain of the db/db Type II diabetes mouse following cerebral HI.   Specifically, the effects of diabetes on neutrophil infiltration, endothelial cell activation (ICAM-1 and P-Selectin), and BBB integrity was compared to the heterozygous control (db/+).  The underlying hypothesis was that diabetic db/db mice, in comparison to the heterozygous control (db/+), will have more neutrophils adhering to the cerebral vessels and infiltrating the brain resulting in increased cell death following cerebral HI.  \n\t8-week old db/db mice, and their non-diabetic db/+ controls, were subjected to unilateral carotid ligation and hypoxia (HI) and their brains were analyzed at 4 and 24 hr post-HI.  In another series of experiments, circulating neutrophils were depleted 24 hr prior to HI with the rat anti-mouse Ly6G 1A8 antibody and then 30 min prior to sacrifice bovine serum albumin was injected (i.v) to determine the level of BBB permeability.  Brains were analyzed at 4 and 24 hr post-HI, as before. Blood and brain samples were collected for flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blot analysis. \n\tConsistent with previous studies, HI resulted in a more rapid and extensive cell death in db/db mice, relative to the non-diabetic, db/+ mice.  MMP-9 was variably associated with cell death in both the db/db and db/+ mice.  Also, while there was more MMP-9 protein detected in the cortex and caudate-putamen of the db/db mice, there was also more tissue damage.   P-selectin and ICAM-1 protein expression were not altered with diabetes.  Additionally, while there was an effect of diabetes on circulating neutrophil levels, which significantly increased even in response to sham surgery in the db/db mice, brain neutrophil levels were not consistently associated with cell death in either the db/db or db/+ mice.  Similar to MMP-9 protein, while there were more neutrophils in the cortex and caudate-putamen of the db/db mice, there was also more tissue damage.  There was also early loss of BBB proteins (occludin, collagen IV, and laminin) in the db/db mice, but only in those brains where there was also more tissue damage.  Finally, neutrophil depletion had no effect on infarct area in the db/+ mice and had a variable effect on infarct area in the db/db mice.  Neutrophil depletion also had no effect on MMP-9 and BBB breakdown.  Overall, future studies need to compare more comparably damaged db/db and db/+ mice in order to separate out the effect of diabetes versus extent of cell death.      \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5543], "author_name_tesi": "Patel, Shyama Dinesh", "last_name_ssi": "Patel", "middle_name_ssi": "Dinesh", "first_name_ssi": "Shyama", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ian Alexander Simpson", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Susan Vannucci", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ian Alexander Simpson, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Chair", "Susan Vannucci, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "Samuel Shaomin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diabetes", "stroke", "neutrophils"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE MAPPING OF SUPERSONIC FLOW AND\nCALIBRATION OF A FOUR ELEMENT HOT-FILM PROBE", "id": "8816", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6368", "abstract_tesi": "The major goal of this study was to perform preliminary velocity and flow angulation\ncalibration of a new four element hot-film probe designed by Tao Systems.

There are two primary types of aluminum alloys used \nin aircraft: cast alloys and wrought alloys. Majority of the traditionally used cast aluminum alloys in aircraft manufacturing are the Al-Cu or Al-Si-Mg alloys including A214, A355, A356 and E 357. Aluminum castings are typically produced using green sand, permanent mold casting or die casting. However, aluminum castings are susceptible to porosity defects. Porosity is a microscopic void or hole found in a casting. To eliminate micro-porosity defects in aluminum castings, multiple heat treatments can be used.  \n\nIn particular hot isostatic pressing (HIP) can be used to effectively to remove sub-surface porosity in complex shaped castings. HIPing process includes the use of elevated temperature and the application of a hydrostatic pressure via pressurized gas.

Whether the result of experimental measurements or numerical simulations, it is of particular importance to use such data to provide a model-based and objective quantification of the dynamical complexity of a system, which, together with a measure of its stochasticity, determine fundamental limits to the system's predictability. However, a number of approaches for estimating complexity are based on information theory and require sequences of coarse-grained, or more specifically, discrete observables, which are not usually directly available, and typically have to be generated from continuous-valued discrete-time series.\n\nIn this work, we obtain discrete observables for systems, whose underlying generating mechanism is deterministic chaos, solely from their time series data. We devise a selection procedure to pick good observables from a candidate set, which have a simple structure in the space of continuous observations, and also remain particularly faithful to the original time series measurements without much loss of the relevant information. Using coarse-grained observables, we build computational models, which while being minimal in a specific sense, are in turn capable of statistically reproducing input sequence of these observables with high likelihood on average, at par with its true probability. From these coarse-grained, computational models, we then calculate information-theoretic quantities that distinguish apparent randomness from the deterministic structure of the system dynamics, as hidden in the time series data and captured by its discrete observables. Using these measures, we quantify the interaction effect of the external stochastic fluctuations with the underlying deterministic chaotic behavior of the driven nonlinear oscillators. We confirm the transition in the measure of randomness as a function of the noise level, from almost constant to a significantly high power-law growth regime. Finally, we study the noise-induced transitions of stable periodic orbits as part of the major problem of distinguishing chaos from noise, using noisy experimental measurements alone. We find that the possibility of such distinction is dependent on the amplitude of external stochastic fluctuations and also, to an extent, on the choice of coarse-grained observables.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15093], "author_name_tesi": "Patil, Navendu Santosh", "last_name_ssi": "Patil", "middle_name_ssi": "Santosh", "first_name_ssi": "Navendu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph P.

The design is carried out in the analog domain to exploit certain advantages of analog integrated circuit design, such as, high efficiency, in terms of area and power, and ease of computation. The neural architecture designed is a multilayer feedforward neural network to solve the XOR classification problem, which serves as a benchmark for several complex classification problems that are not linearly separable. Each component circuit of the network, such as the synapse circuit that performs the multiplication operation and the non-linear activation function circuit that acts as squashing function, is designed using MOSFETs operating in the sub-threshold (weak inversion) region.\nThe schematic designs are carried out using Cadence OrCAD Capture version 16.6 EDA software and simulated using PSPICE version 16.6, an in-built simulation tool within OrCAD capture. The layout of the individual components and the overall schematic is also done using Electric VLSI Design software version 9.06 on a 200 nm design scale. A consistency check is carried out to ensure equivalency of layout with the schematic, for a potential scope towards chip fabrication using Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service (MOSIS) foundry.

Most applications\naccess shared storage servers through a multi-level buffer cache hierarchy. Multiple I/O applications accessing these shared resources give rise to inter-application interference at the disk level as well as the shared buffer caches throughout the hierarchy. Consequently, the disk spends most of its time positioning the head for the next I/O operation (IOP) and numerous destructive interferences are observed throughout all the shared buffer caches accessed by the compute nodes and the shared storage servers. This application interference reduces the effective capacity of the caches by displacing useful data before it is accessed, at the same time forcing the disk to spend most of the time in seeking due to the interleaving of the different I/O streams arising from these\ndifferent applications.\n\nThis thesis presents an end-to-end interference minimizing uniquely designed high performance I/O stack that spans multi-level shared buffer cache hierarchies accessing shared I/O servers to deliver a seamless high performance I/O stack. In this thesis, I show that I can build a superior I/O stack which minimizes the inter-application interference and consequently increases application performance based on our understanding of application characteristics such as reuse and locality, application data access patterns, application execution history, disk characteristics such as spin time and seek\ntime. This thesis offers a unparalleled  substantiation of designing high performance I/O stack components to minimize the inter-application interference suitably to get the best application performance. I propose several novel modules that work at different layers in the I/O stack to increase application performance dramatically.\n\nThis thesis has four main contributions:\n\n(1) I propose a novel client side prefetching module called APP, (Aggressive Pipelined\nPrefetching which automatically detects and configures prefetching parameters, selectively offloads data to idle remote buffer caches and transfers data in the background to minimize the\ninter-application interference seen on the shared disks to ultimately increase disk throughput and decrease application execution time.\n\n(2) I propose an application scheduler called AppMap (Application Mapper) which schedules\napplications based on application  characteristics such as reuse and locality on the nodes of multi-level buffer cache hierarchy to increase application hit rates throughout the shared buffer caches in the hierarchy and  decrease application execution time.\n\n(3) I propose an end-to-end hint exploiter I/O stack called Mnemosyne which makes use of user specified data access pattern hints to increase the effectiveness of multi-tiered buffer caches by eliminating duplication and caching the hotter data in the upper level caches. At the same time it uses these hints to predict the next access and prefetch the data, thus, reducing the disk interference.\n\n(4) I propose a server buffer cache partitioning module called Caerus which partitions the shared server buffer cache to minimize the inter-application interference seen on shared server buffer caches such that it increases the hit rate of the individual applications along with the overall buffer cache hit rate.\n\nThe first contribution of this thesis is an intelligent client side prefetching module called APP which automatically infers and configures parameters to minimize inter-application disk interference. The goal of APP is to decrease application execution time by increasing the throughput of individual I/O streams and utilizing idle capacity on remote nodes along with idle network times thus effectively avoiding alternating bursts of activity followed by periods of inactivity. APP significantly increases overall I/O throughput and decreases overall messaging overhead\nbetween servers. APP clients make use of aggressive prefetching and data offloading to selective remote buffer caches in multi-level\nbuffer cache hierarchies and background network transfers in an effort to minimize disk interference and tranquilize the effects of\naggressive prefetching.\n\nThe second contribution of this thesis is to come up with a cluster application scheduler or an AppMap which maps applications to the different nodes in a multi-level shared buffer cache hierarchy. The challenge here is to predict the inter-application buffer cache\ninterference without actually executing the applications as well as to schedule the applications such that this interference is\nminimized. We devise two models based on reuse and locality, derive the inter-application interference on all shared nodes and propose a\nlocal optimal algorithm which maps the  applications to the nodes in the hierarchy such that the interference throughout the buffer cache\nhierarchy is minimized. Our models are computationally efficient and require only the reuse distance metric and I/O rates of the\nrespective applications. I/O rate is a concept defined by us as the number of buffer cache blocks touched by an application per second\nand includes both the blocks, read and written by the application. AppMap is especially pertinent in data centers where several\napplications are scheduled on shared resources to avoid over-provisioning.\n\nNext, I propose a novel end-to-end hint exploiter high performance I/O stack called Mnemosyne which is capable of accepting user\nspecified hints specifically data access pattern hints to increase the effectiveness of multi-level caching by striving for exclusivity\nin the buffer cache contents. Multi-level caches are often plagued by content duplication, reducing the effective capacity of these\ncaches. Additionally, due to the duplication, the same interference manifests itself in the lower as well as upper level caches. The\nchallenge here is to assimilate the information provided by the user to come up with a global strategy, which unburdens the user from\nmaking decisions for every loop in the program. Additionally, Mnemosyne uses these hints to predict the next access of the application and prefetch the data before it is requested. I/O\nservers in multi-tiered architectures are often characterized by slack time and peak I/O bursts. Mnemosyne reduces the disk interference by issuing the requests in a layout aware manner, thus, avoiding the disk from getting flooded with requests all at once, which increases the chances of random seeks in the I/O streams.\n\nThe fourth and final contribution of this thesis is the conception of an innovative server cache partitioning module called Caerus which dynamically partitions the server buffer cache to\nminimize the inter-application buffer cache interference such that the individual hit rates of the applications sharing the buffer cache as well as the overall hit rate of the server buffer cache increase. The challenge here is to find the partition size dynamically, such that applications that do not benefit from getting larger cache space are given a small portion of the cache while applications that require more cache space for acquiring higher hit rates get a larger portion of the cache space. At the same time, Caerus takes into account the different phases of application behavior and adapts its allocation based on the phase in which the application is executing.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1070], "author_name_tesi": "Patrick, Christina M", "last_name_ssi": "Patrick", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Padma Raghavan", "Brian Cameron", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Brian Cameron, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["storage cache", "interference", "Multi-level buffer caches", "performance", "I/O", "disk", "cache"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Motivational Perspective on Alcohol Use and Sexual Behavior Among College Students", "id": "8456", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4103", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "College students engage in both alcohol use and sexual behaviors that have important developmental and health implications. Based on the theory of reasoned action, links between motivations for and engagement in drinking and sexual behaviors were examined in three studies. First, a multi-dimensional measure addressing distinct motivations for and against sex was developed. Three sub-scales were designed to measure motivations against sexual behavior: Values, Health, and Not Ready. This scale was used in conjunction with a set of sub-scales (Intimacy, Enhancement, and Coping) assessing motivations for sexual behavior by Cooper, Shapiro, and Powers (1998). The resulting six subscales were shown to be reliable, valid, and configurally invariant across gender and European and Asian American ethnicity (N = 1653; 41.6% male, M = 17.99 years, SD = 0.38) using confirmatory factor analysis. Second, in an independent sample, latent profile analysis was used to identify profiles of motivations for alcohol use and profiles of motivations for sexual behavior (N = 227, 51.1% male, M = 18.85 years, SD = 0.38). Four profiles of alcohol use motivations were identified: Anti Drinking, Average Drinking, Pro Drinking, and Pro Drinking for Sex. Three profiles of motivations for sex were identified: Anti Sex, Pro Sex, and Pro Sex for Coping. Third, a within-person approach was used to model the event-level links between drinking and sex over 14 days (N = 218 people, 51.4% male). Multi-level models were used to model up to 14 days of data for each person (2879 days). After controlling for average alcohol use, the number of drinks consumed on a given day was associated with greater likelihood of having oral sex, a greater number of sexual behaviors, and more short-term positive consequences of sex on that day. A Drinking \u00d7 Alcohol-Sex Expectancies interaction indicated that individuals with more positive expectancies were most likely to have sex after drinking. These results highlight the importance of motivations and expectancies for understanding alcohol use and sexual behavior.

GASB 34 also required many local governments to record and depreciate their infrastructure assets on a retroactive basis.\n\nGASB 34 is perhaps the most important change in government accounting history due to the improvements it will make in the transparency and accountability of government financial reporting, but the provisions of GASB 34 have been unpopular, costly, and difficult to implement.  Adoption is mandatory, but the consequences for failing to adopt are minimal, since there is little regulatory oversight over the financial reporting of local governments.  Given these conditions, the extent to which local governments have adopted GASB 34 is unknown.  \n\n\nThis study used Everett Rogers' model of organizational innovativeness to identify the organizational determinants associated with the adoption of GASB 34 in Pennsylvania local government.  The model contained three organizational components: organizational culture, organizational structure, and the external environment.  Proxies of organizational culture were the propensity to innovate and responsiveness to constituents.  Proxies of organizational structure were occupational specialization, functional differentiation, administrative intensity, organizational size, and slack resources.  Proxies of the external environment were debt financing and percentage of intergovernmental revenue.  The research question was: Can a model of organizational innovativeness identify the determinants of the adoption of GASB 34 among Pennsylvania local governments?  \n\n\nThe logistic regression indicated that organizational size was a strong and consistent determinant of adoption, supporting the hypothesis that larger Pennsylvania local governments are more likely to adopt administrative innovations such as GASB 34 than smaller local governments.  The propensity to innovate and responsiveness to constituents were also included in the model, but the predictive ability of these variables was much weaker than that of organizational size.  Overall, the results suggested that components of organizational culture and structure can be determinants of the adoption of administrative innovations such as GASB 34.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4828], "author_name_tesi": "Patrick, Patricia A.", "last_name_ssi": "Patrick", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Patricia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Ames Peterson", "Frances T.

Chapter 3 of this dissertation solidifies and defines the WrbA protein family across all domains of life.  Presented with a phylogeny are the first biochemical investigations of WrbA proteins from E. coli and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, a thermophilic species from the Archaea domain.  This research is the first to demonstrate that WrbA proteins have NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductase (NQO) activity.  Physiologically relevant kinetic parameters presented here implicate WrbA in two-electron reduction of quinones, protecting against oxidative stress.  Throughout the experiments, wild-type WrbA proteins demonstrate monomer-dimer-tetramer equilibria with one FMN cofactor per monomer in the holo-tetramer.  Chapter 4 examines multimeric flavodoxin-like NAD(P)H:Quinone Oxidoreductases (NQOs) with many similarities to WrbA proteins, and a phylogeny suggests that WrbA is evolutionarily related to these NQOs.  They appear to function in redox-linked processes and protect against environmental stressors, and previous research indicates that reduced dimeric NQO protein is required to protect protein targets from proteasomal degradation.  Chapter 5 is the first comprehensive biophysical investigation of any flavodoxin-like NQO protein and it employs E. coli WrbA as the model protein.  The study focuses on peptide interactions with the WrbA flavin cofactor, and it incorporates biochemical and biophysical characterizations of wild-type proteins and alanine variants of E. coli WrbA.  Fluorescence quenching experiments demonstrate that flavin binding is cooperative and linked to multimerization in E. coli WrbA; monomer WrbA does not bind flavin.  Redox potentials were determined with a gold-capillary spectroelectrochemical cell that I constructed and modified from previous investigations.  (Construction of the electrochemical cell apparatus is presented in Appendix A.)  The experiments show H133 directs electron accumulation to the flavin isoalloxazine ring in WrbA.  Specific activities indicate that WrbA proteins retain activity with smaller electron acceptors and that the residues investigated by alanine-scanning are important for enzyme activity.

This inextensible fiber material is advantageous for manufacturing high performance aerospace grade components because of its superior mechanical properties. Unfortunately, when compared to automated metal fabrication or injection molding processes, high production costs plague the manufacturing of CCF composite components. Discontinuous Carbon Fiber (DCF) materials have been developed for production of structural composite components. DCF materials were able to form complex geometries due to enhanced fiber axis stretching, in-plane shear, and inter-ply shear. Use of DCF materials with low cost advanced forming technologies has increased but transition of formed products is limited to simple geometric shapes due to process limitations caused by the occurrence of deleterious deformations.\n\nA single diaphragm forming process was utilized to form pre-collated laminates of pre-impregnated DiscoTexTM into a sine wave spar for use in aerospace wing structures. Sine wave spars are opposite sign doubly curved geometries that are difficult to form. DiscoTexTM is a five harness satin woven DCF that was pre- impregnated with an out of autoclave resin system, Cytec Cycom 5320-1. The forming parameters manipulated were: diaphragm stiffness, forming temperature, forming time, stretch in the warp direction, stretch in the fill direction, laminate thickness, laminate size and lamina fiber orientation on component quality. The effect these parameters had on the developed in-plane shear strains were identified to determine the forming characteristics of the DCF material.\n\nIn order of significance, the research results showed that forming temperature, forming time, laminate size and diaphragm stiffness had the greatest effect on in-plane shear strain.

A reduced capacity of 50% of the surfactant tailored GAC was observed when Rapid Small Scale Column Tests (RSSCT) were employed.  Rapid Small Scale Column Tests that employed Redlands, CA groundwater, with perchlorate of 30 \u00b5g/L, showed that 33,000 bed volumes of groundwater was processed through Arquad 2C-75 tailored GAC, before perchlorate was observed in the effluent at 6 \u00b5g/L.   When the same water had 1000 \u00b5g/L of thiosulfate, 17,000 BV of Redlands, groundwater was processed through the surfactant tailored carbon before perchlorate was observed at 6 \u00b5g/L.  It was determined that an implementation of a pretreatment step that utilized 2,500 \u00b5g/L  of chlorine, diminished the effects of thiosulfate, by oxidizing the thiosulfate anion to sulfate and thus, returned the surfactant tailored GAC capacity to 90% of its capability.  With this pre-treatment method, the surfactant tailored GAC technology can be a viable method in the removal of perchlorate from groundwater, in the presence of intermediate \u2013valence sulfur species. \n\nNitrate, another oxyanion that is common in ground waters, was also observed to strongly compete with perchlorate for adsorption sites on activated carbon loaded with quaternary ammonium surfactant.  It was observed that at 3 times the concentration of the initial nitrate of 30 mg/L in Fontana, CA groundwater, the surfactant tailored GAC capacity to adsorbed perchlorate was reduced to 46 %.  Additional experiments demonstrated that surfactant tailored GAC works best at removing perchlorate from aqueous systems at low nitrate concentrations.\n\nThis research also evaluated the scaling technology that employed the RSSCT scaling equations for proportional diffusivity.  The proportional diffusivity model was designed to predict the performance of pilot and field scale experiments by utilizing smaller fixed bed columns over a shorter test period.   The proportional diffusivity model used an intra-particle coefficient of 1.   A comparison of pilot scale tests and RSSCT indicated that the RSSCT design that employed the proportional diffusivity model, and used surfactant tailored GAC, over predicted the removal of perchlorate, by a ratio of 0.58.  This result differs from activated carbon that was not tailored with surfactants, in that proportional diffusivity accurately predicts the performance of pilot scale tests.  These results suggest that intra-particle diffusivity does not linearly correlates to particle radius when activated carbon was tailored with surfactants, as was demonstrated with non tailored activated carbon.  An intra-particle diffusivity coefficient that is 0.5 less than the coefficient used for proportional diffusivity scale was evaluated. Results showed that RSSCT that used a diffusivity coefficient of 0.5 under predicted the model for the pilot scale system and gave a ratio of 0.38.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2929], "author_name_tesi": "Patterson, Judodine Peta-Gaye", "last_name_ssi": "Patterson", "middle_name_ssi": "Peta-Gaye", "first_name_ssi": "Judodine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Brian Dempsey", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "Kwadwo Asare Osseo Asare"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Member", "Kwadwo Asare Osseo Asare, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["perchlorate", "surfactant tailored GAC", "ion exchange", "activated carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Acoustic Fault Detection in Tactical Flow Meters", "id": "14185kap5509", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The United States Army is beginning to use turbine flow meters to track bulk fluid fuel transfers and receipts from tanker trucks to storage tanks, bags and end users. Previous research has been conducted to improve the accuracy of measurements used to record large-volume fuel transactions. Installation of this research included implementing temperature, density and viscosity correction algorithms and automated reporting on measured fluid transfer volumes onto the embedded processor.\nThe objective of this research was to use acoustic and vibration data to detect failure modes which can cause flow measurement error. Lab testing on the flow meter\u2019s turbine blades determined key frequency components in the moving parts of the flow meter. Field testing, at a make-shift ARL fuel storage and distribution farm (using water as a surrogate for fuel), determined the characteristics of a normally functioning meter. Several failure modes were detected when field testing these flow meters resulting in flow measurement errors greater than the allowable 0.5% of total volume. After initial analysis, testing was conducted to introduce two faults into the flow meter: air entrainment and debris caught in the flow loop.\nFurther analysis was performed to identify characteristics of these two failure modes. Air entrainment in the flow meter caused a significant decrease in amplitude to a 4kHz tone normally present in vibration data. Debris caught in the flow meter turbine blades resulted in an overall increase in vibration amplitude as well as a drastic increase in amplitude to frequencies between 1.6kHz and 1.8kHz. Based upon both of these observations, preliminary detection algorithms were developed with the intent of Condition Based Maintenance. Future work to improve flow meter accuracy includes detecting calibration drift and internal sensor placement.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15422], "author_name_tesi": "Patterson, Kevin A", "last_name_ssi": "Patterson", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Martin Reichard", "David Carl Swanson", "Daniel Allen Russell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Martin Reichard, Thesis Advisor", "David Carl Swanson, Committee Member", "Daniel Allen Russell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acoustics", "flow meter", "condition based maintenance"]}]
