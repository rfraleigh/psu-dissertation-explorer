One such factor is temporal distance, the distance between evaluation and actual consumption of the event. The purpose of this research was to explore various attributes of a cruise ship (i.e., onboard attributes) and examine how the importance of onboard attributes is affected by temporal distance in consumers\u2019 pre-purchase evaluation of a cruise. To accomplish this aim, the results are presented in two separate articles. \n      In the first article a list of onboard attributes was identified based on open coding of online cruise reviews and in-depth interviews with cruisers and potential cruisers. In addition, a systematic comparison was made between cruisers and potential cruisers in terms of the general importance they attach to the onboard attributes in the cruise decision, which is grounded in Attribute Knowledge Theory and studies on tourists\u2019 novelty seeking. Using a sample of cruisers and potential cruisers with similar socio-demographics, the results indicated that cruisers and potential cruisers perceived seven dimensions of onboard attributes, but attached different importance to some of them. Specifically, potential cruisers attached a higher level of importance to onboard attributes deemed unimportant by cruisers (i.e., \u201cRecreation and Sport Attributes,\u201d \u201cFitness and Health Attributes,\u201d and \u201cSupplementary Attributes\u201d), but attached a similar level of importance to onboard attributes deemed important by cruisers (i.e., \u201cEntertainment Attributes,\u201d \u201cCore Attributes,\u201d and \u201cCrew Attributes\u201d). \n      Building upon the findings presented in the first article, the effect of temporal distance on the importance of onboard attributes in pre-purchase evaluation of a cruise was evaluated. This inquiry was grounded in Construal Level Theory, which distinguishes two types of attributes: high-level construal attributes (essential and superordinate) and low-level construal attributes (peripheral and subordinate). Using a sample of real cruisers between 50 and 59 years old, the data suggested that, in general, consumers attach more relative importance to high-level construal attributes when temporal distance is large, but attach more relative importance to low-level construal attributes when temporal distance is small. \n      In summary, the findings indicate that temporal distance is an important contextual factor in pre-purchase evaluation of a cruise. It affects the importance of onboard attributes in different ways, depending on whether an attribute is deemed to be high-level construal or low-level construal.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2287], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Anna S Mattila", "Alan R Graefe", "Garry Chick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Chair", "Anna S Mattila, Committee Member", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Member", "Garry Chick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["attribute", "decision making", "cruising", "temporal distance"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Probing the mechanism of conformationally gated inter-subunit radical transfer in the Mn/Fe-dependent ribonucleotide reductase from Chlamydia trachomatis\n\n\n\n", "id": "9198", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A conventional class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) employs a diferric-tyrosyl radical (Y\u2022) cofactor in its R2 subunit for reversible generation of a 3'-hydrogen-abstracting cysteine radical in its R1 subunit by proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) through a network of aromatic amino acids spanning the two subunits. The class Ic RNR from Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), uses a Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cofactor in place of the Y\u2022 for radical initiation. The residues for PCET are thought to be conserved in both systems. The properties of the PCET in Ct provided a unique chance to study the mechanism of conformationally gated inter-subunit PCET in Ct RNR. In this study, site-directed mutation showed resides W51, Y338 in R2, Y991, Y990 and C672 in R1 are essential for PCET and without any of them could almost totally inactivate the enzyme. We showed the pathway radicals were accumulated by formation of the one-electron more oxidized Mn(IV)/Fe(IV) form of the cofactor in the presence of R1 and substrate within variant proteins. We also used sodium dithionite as a reductant to test its ability to reduce the active form Mn(IV)/Fe(III) to Mn(III)/Fe(III) and produce a well-resolved EPR signal. The well-resolved EPR signal is due to the binding of R1 (CDP) to Mn(III)/Fe(III)\u2013R2 causing a conformational change that is propagated to the cofactor in R2. From our results, residues W51, Y338 in R2, Y991, Y990 and C672 play no role in this conformational change behavior. Additionally, we also studied the mechanism of the radical scavenger-hydroxyurea (HU) reduction of Mn(IV)/Fe(III) cluster. Combination of the EPR and stopped-flow experiments, W51-Y222 and W51-Y338 pathways can be two candidates to direct HU reduction.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3222], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, Jiajia  ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiajia ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PCET", "ribonucleotide reductase"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Three Dimensional Integrated Circuit Design and Test", "id": "26281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emerging three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) is one of the most promising solutions for future IC designs. 3D stacking enables much higher memory bandwidth and much lower overhead in multi-power domain design, which provides solutions for chip-multiprocessor design in mitigating the \"memory wall\" and \"dark-silicon\" problem. At the same time, 3D technology leads to new opportunities and challenges in the field of circuit and system design techniques, EDA tools and chip testing mechanism. This dissertation presents two killer applications for the modern 3D system and one 3D testing solution. \n\nThe first contribution of this dissertation is to propose a killer application for TSV based system - the 3D memory stacking. This dissertation presents a 3D memory stacking system that leverages the massive number of TSVs between memory layers to help high-bandwidth checkpointing/restore. To validate the proposed scheme, 2-layer TSV-based SRAM-SRAM 3D-stacked chip is implemented to mimic the high-bandwidth and fast data transfer from one memory layer to another memory layer, so that the in-memory checkpointing/restore scheme can be enabled for the future exascale computing. The capacity of each SRAM layer is 1 Mbit.  Each layer contains 64 banks, with each bank contains 256 words and the word length is 64-bit.  The final footprint including I/O pad is 2.9mm X 2mm. The SRAM dies were taped out in GlobalFoundries using its 130nm low power process, and the 3D stacking was done by using Tezzaron's TSV technology. The prototyping chip can perform checkpointing/restore at the speed of 4K/cycle with 1Ghz clock.\n\nThis dissertation also gives an applicable solution for 3D testing. Testing for 3D ICs based on through-silicon-via (TSV) is one of the major challenges for improving the system yield and reducing the overall cost. The lack of pads on most tiers and the mechanical vulnerability of tiers after wafer thinning make it difficult to perform 3D Known-Good-Die (KGD) test with the existing 2D IC probing methods. This dissertation presents a novel and time-efficient 3D testing flow. In this Known-Good-Stack (KGS) flow, a yield-aware TSV defect searching and replacing strategy is introduced. The Build-in-Self-Test (BIST) design with TSV redundancy scheme help improve the system yield for today's imperfect TSV fabrication process. Our study shows that less than 6 redundant TSVs is enough to increase the TSV yield to 98% for a TSV cluster with a size under 16 X 16 with relatively low initial TSV yield. The average TSV cluster testing and self-fixing time is about 3-16 testing cycle depending on the initial TSV yield.\n\nThe second killer application for 3D system in this dissertation is multi-power domain system design utilizing the monolithic technology. Optimizing energy consumption for electronic systems has been an important design consideration. Among all the techniques, multi-power domain design is a widely used one for low power and high performance applications. In order to perform the data transfer between these different power domains, we needs a cross power domain interface (CPDI). The existing level-conversion flip-flop (LCFF) structures all require dual power rails, which results in large area and performance overhead. We proposed a scan-able CPDI circuit utilizing monolithic 3D technology. This interface functions as a flip-flop and provides reliable data conversion from one power domain to another. It also has built-in scan feature which makes it testable. Our design separates power rails in each tier, substantially reduced physical design complexity and area penalty. The design is implemented in a 20nm, 28nm and 45nm low power technology. It shows 20%-35% smaller D to Q comparing with normal designs. The proposed design also shows scalability and better energy consumption than precious LCFF design.\n\nFinally, we presented a dual power domain deep pipeline circuit architecture for future power-efficient systems. We reduce the power consumption by putting all the combinational logics in a lower power domain, while all the FFs and clock network operate at normal voltage for smaller insertion delay and better clock control. In order to realize these functions and system benefits, we proposed a novel level conversion flip flop omega design, which has 30% insertion delay than the normal flop design and could be easily integrated into today\u2019s synthesis flow. This work provides guideline on how to design a dual power domain system with less power under the same system throughput requirement. A system level estimation shows that the 3D dual power supply system could consume about 15% less energy by using our design methodology.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10894], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yuan Xie", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Zhiwen Liu", "Lee David Coraor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yuan Xie, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane Irwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Lee David Coraor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["VLSI", "Three Dimensional Integrated Circuit", "Testing", "Circuit Design", "Low Power", "High Performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "INTELLIGENT ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS INCORPORATED WITH MEAL DETECTION SYSTEM AND RECOMMENDER SYSTEM FOR TYPE-1 DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT", "id": "13721jxx123", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13721", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Type 1 Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting\nfrom defects in insulin secretion.

These techniques can be deployed to secure emergent networks including peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing systems and wireless communication systems.\n\nIn recent years, worms have emerged as one of the most disastrous security threats to various information systems and network infrastructures.\nAlthough Internet worms have been extensively studied, worm issues in such emergent networks as peer-to-peer (P2P) systems and cellular networks have yet received due attention. This dissertation aims at designing automated, realtime, and systematic countermeasures, which leverage\nthe existing internal communication mechanisms and network infrastructure to contain worm propagation. The proposed defenses consist of security solutions for both client and system software.\n\nFor P2P networks, this dissertation first proposes a partition-based scheme and a CDS-based scheme to contain ultra-fast topological worm spreads. These schemes leverage the underlying P2P overlay for\ndistributing automated security patches to vulnerable machines. They are unique in adopting graph-theory techniques for containing fast spreading worms. This dissertation then proposes a P2P-tailored solution to combat file-sharing worms in P2P environments. Our solution consists of a\ndownload-based scheme and a search-based scheme. Both schemes utilize the existing file-sharing mechanisms to internally disseminate security\npatches to participating peers in a timely and distributed fashion.\n\nFor cell-phone networks, this dissertation proposes two device-level defenses for securing smartphone software, namely an access control-based scheme and a GTT-based scheme. These schemes are unique in that they either enforce security policies in phone devices to identify and block worm attacks or leverage artificial intelligence (AI) methods to differentiate human or worm initiators of the phone applications. This\ndissertation also proposes a systematic countermeasure consisting of both terminal-level and network-level defenses for combating cell-phone worms. Unlike the existing solutions that split the collaboration between the\nterminal device and the network to throttle system-wide worm spreads, the proposed solution adopts an identity-based signature scheme at both the sender and the receiver side, and a detection-based automated patching scheme at the network side. Combining terminal-level and network-level defenses effectively speeds up the process of worm detection and victim disinfection.\n\nThis dissertation also provides solid mathematical analyses, extensive simulations and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and show the applicability of the proposed defenses. In addition, it discusses some open issues related to the proposed solutions and suggests some\ninteresting directions in combating the worm threats as the emergent networks evolve.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3846], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, Liang ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Thomas F Laporta", "Guohong Cao", "Zan Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Zan Huang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["p2p networks", "cellular networks", "worm threats", "countermeasures"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ASSEMBLY OF EXBD TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAINS IN THE TONB COMPLEX\n\n\n", "id": "11211", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4556", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Gram-negative bacteria, the TonB system is involved in transducing the proton motive force (pmf) of the cytoplasmic membrane to catalyze active transport by high-affinity outer membrane transporters. As essential components of the TonB system, ExbD/ExbB harness the pmf and transmit it to TonB. Subsequently, TonB interacts with outer membrane transporters to provide energy for active transport. However, the detailed function and organization of the ExbD transmembrane domain (TMD) in this system are still unknown.  \nTo analyze the organization of the ExbD TMD, a cysteine scanning study was initiated. Putative ExbD TMD residues (F23 to V43) were systematically replaced with cysteine. Phenotypic analyses showed that all of the ExbD TMD residues cysteine substitutions were sensitive to colicins except D25C, which is consistent with previous research that the conserved aspartate residue was the only functionally important side chain in the ExbD TMD. Disulfide cross-linking analysis showed that six substitutions, ExbD F23C, I24C, L40C, A41C, T42C and V43C, formed homodimers. Especially for the last four mutants, dimer formation was much more prominent, suggesting that these residues were located at the ExbD-ExbD contacting interface, and they were anchoring close enough to interact. Additionally, disulfide bonds formed between ExbD T42C or V43C blocked iron-transport activity of the TonB system, and this deficiency can be rescued by addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol. Furthermore, the presence of D25N enhanced the efficiency of the disulfide cross-linking of ExbD cysteine substitutions, but aroB only affected the disulfide cross-linking of ExbD T42C. Interestingly, TonB and ExbB have opposite effects on the dimer formation of ExbD: absence of TonB facilitates ExbD dimer formation, while most of ExbD remains monomeric in the absence of ExbB. In this research, we studied the organization of ExbD TMD for the first time and obtained many interesting and controversial results. In order to eliminate these results, some further study should be done.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4524], "author_name_tesi": "Xie, Mingchao ", "last_name_ssi": "Xie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mingchao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle", "Kathleen Postle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle, Thesis Advisor", "Kathleen Postle, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ExbD", "TonB system", "Transmembrane Domain"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Supporting Participation and Mobile Interactions in Community Events\n", "id": "10172", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6657", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past ten years, the broadband wireless networks have been considerably developed.

The second generation pressure deposition tester (PDT-II) was developed to investigate the effects of some factors (die geometry and size, die configuration and location of the die, powder characteristics, and feed shoe speed) on the deposition process and final pressure distribution. A battery powder mixture and an alumina powder were used to fill three parallel-oriented dies. Cylindrical, toroidal, and E-shaped dies were investigated. For the cylindrical and toroidal dies, feed shoe speeds of 20, 100, 200 (for the alumina powder), and 500 mm/s (for the battery powder mixture) were tested. For the E-shaped dies, 20 mm/s was used. A computed tomography (CT) scanner was employed to obtain fill density distribution for the cylindrical and toroidal dies filled with the two powders. \n\tPDT-II satisfactorily generates a real-time pressure profile of the process and final pressures at multiple locations. For the cylindrical dies filled with the battery powder mixture: 1) at 20 and 100 mm/s feed shoe speeds, the half circle close to the leeward end had higher final pressures; 2) at 500 mm/s, the final pressure distribution was more uniform; 3) the final pressure distribution was not always symmetrical about the center line. Final pressure decreased with increasing radial distance for low feed shoe speeds. The distribution was not always regular for high speed; 4) the three parallel dies did not always have similar pressure distributions; 5) the 500 mm/s feed shoe speed resulted in higher (P < 0.05) final pressures (774.5 to 1424.5 Pa) than at lower speeds (235.2 to 1136.0 Pa) at most locations; 6) at 20 and 100 mm/s feed shoe speeds, the right die tended to have higher (P < 0.05) final pressures (393.8 to 1136.0 Pa) than the center die (235.2 to 726.0 Pa). At 500 mm/s, the quantitative differences between the center (774.5 to 1246.1 Pa) and right dies (897.3 to 1424.5 Pa) were reduced (most locations P > 0.05); 7) most powder (\u00a1\u00dd 90%) was deposited in the forward stroke. \n\tResults of the toroidal dies filled with the battery powder mixture showed: 1) the 0\u00a1\u00e3 orientation area had the highest pressures (1186.7 to 2498.0 Pa). The average pressures of the remaining area were 353.7 to 648.0 Pa; 2) the pressure distribution was symmetrical; 3) the 500 mm/s feed shoe speed led to the most nonuniform and the densest filling; 4) Higher feed shoe speed did not always result in higher final pressures ; 5) the right die tended to have higher (P < 0.05) final pressures (215.0 to 2498.0 Pa) than the center die (95.4 to 2052.5 Pa).\n\tResults of the E-shaped dies indicated that: 1) the final pressures of the middle leg (308.9 to 760.7 Pa for the battery powder, and 41.9 to 130.7 Pa for the alumina) were higher (P < 0.05) than those of the left and right legs (148.9 to 530.3 Pa for the battery powder, and 26.1 to 79.6 Pa for the alumina); 2) for the battery powder, the area along the back side had the highest final pressures (1054.6 to 1303.8 Pa); 3) the pressure distribution was symmetrical about the center line; 4) neither the center die, nor the right die always had higher pressures than the other one; 5) for the alumina powder, the area of the highest final pressures (126.4 to 152.3 Pa) was in the vicinity of the junction of the middle leg and the back. \n\tFor the cylindrical dies filled with the alumina powder: 1) at 20 and 100 mm/s feed shoe speeds, final pressure distribution was symmetrical. The center zone had the highest pressures (P < 0.05), and final pressures decreased with increasing radii; 2) at 200 mm/s, final pressure distribution was irregular and varied more than at lower feed shoe speeds; 3) no consistent shoe speed effect was discovered; 4) at 20 and 100 mm/s, the right die tended to have higher (P < 0.05) final pressures (49.5 to 288.8 Pa) than the center die (68.9 to 167.0 Pa). At 500 mm/s, the center (58.7 to 213.6 Pa) and the right (126.7 to 208.9) dies had similar final pressures (P > 0.05). \n\tNeither of the cylindrical and toroidal dies led to consistently higher final pressures for the battery powder mixture (P > 0.05). For the alumina powder, no consistent trend and no large differences were observed between cylindrical and toroidal dies (P > 0.05).\n\tCT scanner data of the cylindrical dies demonstrated: 1) CT number vs. bulk density did not have a strong linear correlation for the two powders (R2 \u00a1\u00dc 0.625); 2) the final bulk density distribution obtained by CT scanning was uniform within each die and among the three dies, based on the linear correlation with R2 \u00a1\u00dc 0.625 of CT number vs. bulk density; 3) CT scanner and PDT-II measured two different attributes (distribution of bulk densities and distribution of pressure values at the die bottom, respectively); 4) CT data and PDT-II data revealed that the half circle close to the leeward end had relatively high final mass (pressure) values.\n\tFor cylindrical dies filled with the battery powder mixture at 20 mm/s feed shoe speed, the entire pressure profile was divided into 10 stages, which were modeled by an overall rate equation. The overall rate equation was: dPp/d\u00a6\u00d3 = \u00a6\u00c1PpF(\u00a6\u00d3) + \u00a6\u00c2, where Pp is prorated pressure, \u00a6\u00d3 is normalized time, \u00a6\u00c1, \u00a6\u00c2 are coefficients, and F(\u00a6\u00d3) is a stage specific deposition rate function. The average root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean value of average relative difference (ARD) of the model for totally 17 locations in the vicinity of the center (r \u00a1\u00dc 4 mm) of the center die were 0.13 and 0.07 (or 7%), respectively.

In order to arrive at the definition for \u201creflective thinking toward deep learning,\u201d this study establishes that reflective thinking toward deep learning refers to a learner\u2019s purposeful and conscious activity of manipulating ideas toward meaningful learning and knowledge integration. The popular kinds of weblog tool usually do not provide any proper prompts for students to make \u201cconnections between the parts of an experience\u201d--an integral part of a reflective activity. A newly designed blogging-mapping tool could scaffold the whole learning process: besides writing blogs on the website, a student could attach up to five keywords to each blog, and link the keywords on the map. The major research question was: What kinds of thinking appeared from the blogs, and the concept maps? \nNine students in a graduate-level instructional design course participated in the study. They wrote one blog each week for an average of 10 weeks. Most of them attached three to five keywords to each blog. They also revised their concept maps one to four times during the semester. \nStudents\u2019 blogs were each analyzed with Automap--software producing mental maps of the blog texts, calculating Automap nodes of high centrality (most talked about nodes and most connected nodes). The researcher compared students-generated keywords against Automap nodes. Results of keywords analyses revealed that 2/3 of the students-attached keywords matched Automap nodes. This might indicate that keywords-attaching prompt could have made students\u2019 thinking explicit. The findings also uncovered a vast variety of differences between participant-selected keywords and Automap nodes and blog main topics. Relative to Automap nodes, some participant-selected keywords: a. summarized some Automap nodes or the main ideas of the blogs; b. were subsumed under some Automap nodes; c. were irrelevant to the main topics. In addition, on some occasions, some participants failed to use keywords to represent the important ideas of their blogs. Each scenario suggested various levels of thinking and utilities of this feature of the tool. The variety in students\u2019 thinking ranged from the most effortless \u201crandomly using suggested keywords\u201d to relatively effortful \u201cfinding components/specifics of major concepts,\u201d and to more effortful \u201cselecting afterthoughts\u201d and \u201cassociating concepts to their application contexts.\u201d \nAll versions of students\u2019 concept maps were analyzed for a. the connected keyword; b. the accuracy of the label; c. how students revised the concept map over time; d. the degree of students\u2019 knowledge integration. Resulted showed that 1) six of the nine participants connected most or all keywords they selected whereas three only connected some keywords. 2) The relationships among concepts reflected the points of view of students\u2019 blogs and the common knowledge of the field. Still, shallow and insensible connections existed across the participants. 3) Most of the students waited until the end of the semester before they started concept mapping. During the semester, they tended to limit the revised connections to keywords of a same blog. Among them, Joe was an particular example in that he modified his concept maps almost every week and all of his connections remained in \u201cclusters\u201d of same blog\u2019 keywords. 4) By the end of the semester, most of the students started to integrate knowledge around some of the core concepts of the field (e.g. \u201cinstructional design\u201d).

In this thesis, we establish an \u201coptoacoustic tweezers\u201d technique to realize the non-invasive, versatile, contactless, and simple manipulation of fluid and particle. This technique utilizes a microbubble, generated by optothermal effect, actuated by acoustic wave, to impact surrounding environment. Vortical cavitation microstreaming is used for fluid manipulation; acoustic radiation force from the dissipation of acoustic energy is used to trap particles and cells. The location of the microbubble itself is manipulated by laser incidence spot.\n\tA few milestones in developing and applying optoacoustic tweezers are presented in this dissertation: in chapter 2, optothermal effect is explored as energy source for building optoacoustic tweezers, in-situ nanostructure synthesis as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is also achieved with the optothermal effect. In chapter 3, generation of microbubbles through the optothermal effect is investigated both theoretically and experimentally; a particle manipulation mechanism based on convective flow around the bubble is proposed. In chapter 4, we combine the optothermal effect generated bubbles with acoustic actuation to establish optoacoustic tweezers, a biocompatible manipulation method of cells. Applications in programmable cell patterning and concentrating are illustrated as well. In chapter 5, the optoacoustic tweezers are applied to probe mechanical biomarkers of cells for cancer diagnosis.

Their vendors\nmaintain rating systems to help smartphone users find best apps. Since positive\nratings and reviews will very likely lead to more downloads and monetary benefit,\nthe rating systems have become a target of manipulation by some app developers.\nThese developers turn to websites like bestreviewapp.com and buy bulk ratings and\nreviews in order to promote their own apps or demote their rivals\u2019 apps. To ensure\napp stores run healthily, app store vendors are forbiding paid ratings and reviews.\nHowever, they are lacking the knowledge of collusive reviewers, manipulated apps,\nand the entire underground market. Moreover, they also need efficient tools to\ndetect collusive reviewers and manipulated apps.\nIn this thesis, we will introduce our study on how to detect collusion groups,\nhow the underground market works, and how to efficiently detect manipulated\napps.\nFirst, we thoroughly analyzed the features of hidden collusion groups and pro-\nposed a novel method (GroupTie) to discover collusive reviewers. Since members\nof a hidden collusion group work together frequently and their ratings often de-\nviate more from apps\u2019 quality, collusive actions will enhance their relation over\ntime. We built a relation graph named tie graph and detected collusion groups by\napplying graph clustering. Simulation results showed that the false positive rate\nof GroupTie approaches 0.31% and its false negative rate is around 9.29%. We\nalso applied our method to detect hidden collusion groups among the reviewers of\n89 apps in Apple\u2019s China App Store. A large number of reviewers were discovered\nbelonging to a large collusion group and several small groups.\nSecond, as a clear understanding of the underground review trading market\nwas lacking, we studied this underground market and statistically analyzed the\npromotion incentives, characteristics of promoted apps and suspicious reviewers.\nTo collect promoted apps, we built an automatic data collection system, App-\nWatcher, which monitored 52 paid review service providers for four months and\ncrawled all the app metadata from their corresponding app stores. Finally, Ap-\npWatcher exposed 645 apps promoted in app stores and 29, 680 apps promoted\nin some popular websites. The underground market was then reported from vari-\nous perspectives (e.g., service price, app volume). We identified some interesting\nfeatures of both promoted apps and suspicious reviewers, which are significantly\ndifferent from those of randomly chosen apps. Finally, we built a simple tracer to\nnarrow down the suspect list of promoted apps in the underground market.\nThird, we designed an algorithm to expose the apps (i.e., abused apps) whose\nratings have been manipulated by collusive attackers. Specifically, we modeled the\nrelations of raters and apps as biclique communities and proposed four attack sig-\nnatures to identify malicious communities, where the raters are collusive attackers\nand the apps are abused apps. We further designed a linear-time search algorithm\nto enumerate such communities in an app store. Our system was implemented\nand initially run against Apple App Store of China on July 17, 2013. In 33 hours,\nour system examined 2, 188 apps, with the information of millions of reviews and\nreviewers downloaded on the fly. It reported 108 abused apps, among which 104\napps were confirmed to be abused and 67 apps still exist on Oct. 15, 2015. In a\nlater time, we ran our tool against Apple App Stores of China, United Kingdom,\nand United States in a much larger scale. The evaluation results show that among\nthe apps examined by our tool, abused apps account for 0.94%, 0.92%, and 0.57%\nout of all the analyzed apps, respectively in June 2013.

In response to insulin growth factor (IGF-1), PI3-kinase phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3. Generation of PIP3 allows the activation of downstream effector proteins.\nPrevious experiments suggested that the PI3-kinase class IA/PKCs/STAT3 pathway was linked to rod photoreceptor differentiation. Activation and inhibition of PI3-kinase class IA increased the number of rods after four days explant culture of postnatal day1 mouse retinas. Therefore, it was hypothesized that throughout retinal development there is a change in the expression of regulatory subunits of PI3-kinases family. Presence of PI3-kinase class IA regulatory subunits was examined in different ages of mouse retinas. It was found that although p85\u03b1, p55\u03b1 and p55\u03b3 were present in mouse retinas, only tyrosine phosphorylation of p55\u03b1 was detected in the retinas after postnatal day 5. These results suggest that p55\u03b1 is the essential subunit controlling PI3-kinase class IA activity.\n3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) was identified as one of the downstream of PI3-kinase. It is a protein serine and threonine kinase required for protein kinase B (Akt) activation in many tissues. It is also a crucial activator of multiple protein kinases, including p70 ribosomal S6-kinase (p70S6K1), protein kinase isoforms (PKCs), and serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK).\nWe also investigated whether PDK-1 was also involved in the PI3-kinase Class IA /PKCs/STAT3 pathway. Serine phosphorylation of PDK-1 was detected in the retina from postnatal day 3. It was found that treatment of retinal explants with PDK-1 inhibitor (BX795) for four days dramatically increased the number of rod photoreceptors. On the other hand, pharmacological inhibition of PDK-1 induced a significant decline of Akt, p70S6K1, PKC-\u03b3 threonine phosphorylation and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. The results indicate that PDK-1 activity is one of the critical in regulating rod photoreceptor differentiation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8558], "author_name_tesi": "Xing, Tiaosi ", "last_name_ssi": "Xing", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tiaosi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Colin James Barnstable"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Colin James Barnstable, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PDK-1", "photoreceptor", "retina development", "PI3kinase", "P85", "p55"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Phase-field Models of iron phosphate and lithium iron phosphate binary system", "id": "15333", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7835", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the phase-field modeling of FePO4-LiFePO4 binary system.

Our lab and others have shown that mechanical loading-induced fluid flow results in ATP release from bone cells and subsequently activates one of ATP receptors, P2Y2 receptor. Thus, we hypothesized that P2Y2 receptor plays an important role in osteoblast mechanotransduction. To test our hypothesis, we first examined the role of P2Y2 receptor in osteoblast mechanotransduction in vitro with both MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell line and primary mouse long bone cells. We found that overexpression of P2Y2 increases fluid flow-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in osteoblasts; whereas knockdown of P2Y2 receptor expression decreases fluid flow-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in osteoblasts. Secondly, we observed in vivo that P2Y2 knockout mice have significantly less bone volume, bone thickness, bone stiffness and bone ultimate breaking force compared with those in wild type mice. More importantly, we also found P2Y2 knockout mice have decreased bone formation rate in response to mechanical loading. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated the importance of lipid rafts in osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation as well as their involvement in the regulation of the vascular shear stress response in endothelial cells, suggesting that lipid raft structure may be responsible for transmitting mechanical signals in osteoblasts. Therefore, we further examined the role of lipid rafts in osteoblast mechanotransduction. Our results showed that disruption of lipid raft structure in osteoblasts significantly inhibits mechano-sensitivity to oscillatory fluid flow in terms of intracellular calcium mobilization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as ATP release. Taken together, our results suggest that both P2Y2 receptor and lipid raft play important roles in osteoblast mechanotransduction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6934], "author_name_tesi": "Xing, Yanghui ", "last_name_ssi": "Xing", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanghui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jun You", "Jun You", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Ronald R Gomes Jr", "Cheng Dong", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jun You, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun You, Committee Chair", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Member", "Ronald R Gomes Jr, Committee Member", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mechanotransduction", "P2Y2", "lipid raft", "osteoblast"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Development of Carboxylic Acid Separation by Nanofiltration Membrane for Carboxylate Platform Using Lignocellulosic Biomass", "id": "22693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10410", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The carboxylate platform utilizes acidogenic digestion, converting lignocellulosic biomass anaerobically into short and medium chain carboxylic acids, which serve as reactive intermediates for downstream biofuel production. As a mixed-culture, non-sterile process, acidogenic digestion may provide a low-cost strategy for high substrate conversion rates and high product yield coefficients from lignocellulosic biomass. However, carboxylic acids in high concentrations are toxic to microorganisms, and can rapidly build up to inhibitory levels. For this process to achieve high conversion rates at an economical biomass loading rate, there is a need to separate and recover carboxylic acids during acidogenic digestion. Very limited research has been done to test different acid recovery technologies that can be applied to this carboxylate bioconversion platform. In this context, the goals of this study were to 1) identify the correlation between solid loading rate and acid yield 2) separate carboxylic acids from acidogenic digestion liquor using nanofiltration (Achilli et al.) and 3) integrate this NF acid removal process into a batch digestion system, with system performance evaluated by the acid yield. The biomass substrate for the digestion studies was mainly hot water pretreated willow wood. The effects of pH and feed pressure on the acid and sugar rejection were investigated with 10 day old willow digestion liquor using two commercialized NF membranes, GE Desal-DK and Desal-DL membrane. In general, NF membrane achieved 0% to 40% rejection of carboxylic acid with the exception of butyric acid (>99% rejection), and > 90% rejection of sugars. The high rejection of butyric acid may be due to butyric acid\u2019s intermolecular interaction with the complex compounds in the digestion liquor. The lactic and acetic acid rejection decreased with pH which was correlated with the degree of dissociation of the acid, while the sugar rejection was not changed significantly by pH. Raising the feed pressure increased the permeate flux and slightly increased sugar rejection but unfortunately also increased the acid rejection. It is concluded that low pH and low pressure are the favored operational parameters to separate lactic and acetic acid. To integrate the processes of separation and digestion, the pretreated willow was digested and the acids were separated from the liquor intermittently by short term NF. After separation the retentate was recycled back into the digestion reactor with water added to maintain the original solids loading rate. The integrated digestion system was able to remove 86.8% of total acid produced and lowered the acid concentration by 87% compared to a control digestion system without acid removal. The acid yield was also enhanced by separation, but not by a statistically significant amount.

Ion exchange using selective ion exchangers is a possible method for these purposes. Na-n-micas (n=2,3 and 4) and NH4+-SnP with layered structures were prepared using NaCl melting and hydrothermal methods, respectively. \nX-ray diffraction and other characterization techniques were carried out on the above synthetic materials to make sure about their phase purity and crystallinity. The Na-n-micas (n=2,3 and 4) showed high crystallinity with high and sharp intensity peaks by the XRD results. The novel NH4+-SnP showed 16.57 angstrom peak at low angle, indicating its layered structure. Infrared spectroscopy studies confirmed the Si-Al composition and interlayer hydration of the Na-n-micas (n=2,3 and 4) and the existence of NH4+ in the NH4+-SnP structure along with interlayer water. The 29Si and 27Al NMR spectroscopy of Na-n-micas (n=2, 3 and 4) revealed their increasing layer charge density as follows: Na-4-mica > Na-3-mica > Na-2-mica, as expected. SEM characterization showed plate-like morphology for all micas in the range of 1 to 6 \u03bcm while NH4+-SnP showed aggregated lath-like particles. TEM micrograph of NH4+-SnP revealed that the lath-like particles are on the order of 20 to 100 nm showing the layered nanostructure of the material with layer thickness of ~16 angstrom. \nThe above cation exchangers were selected for further studies because they showed selective separation of some transition metal cations (Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+) from simulated solution of sea water. Furthermore, aqueous solutions containing sodium and a metal cation in certain ratios were equilibrated in order to construct ion exchange isotherms so as to determine the selectivity of metal cation over Na. Isotherm studies, Kielland plots and distribution coefficients were used to determine the selectivity of different ion exchangers for different metal cations. The 2Na+\u2192M2+ (M= Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Cu2+) exchange studies showed that Na-4-mica showed selectivity for Zn2+ at XZn<~0.15. Na-2-mica showed high selectivity for Cu2+ at all concentrations while Na-3-mica and Na-4-mica showed high selectivity for Cu2+ at certain concentrations. Unlike other samples, Cu2+ exchanged Na-2-micas showed positive Kielland coefficient, indicating the increasing Cu2+ selectivity as X(Cu) increased. NH4+-SnP showed high distribution coefficients (374 for Ni2+, 810 for Zn2+, 343 for Mn2+ and 748 for Cu2+) than other ion exchangers in the sea-mimicking water experiments. The difference in the selectivity of Na-n-micas (n=2,3 and 4) for the metal cations apparently resulted from their differences in layer charge density and interlayer expansibility. \nTwo (001) phases of ~12 angstrom and ~14 angstrom were found in the XRD results of M2+ (M= Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and Cu2+) exchanged Na-n-micas (n=2,3 and 4). The ~14 angstrom peaks resulted from two-layer metal cation hydrates while the ~12 angstrom resulted from one-layer metal cation hydrates. The formation of ~14 angstrom phases were found to be higher from cation exchanged Na-2-mica samples compared to other mica samples, because of lower charge density of the former. This difference in the formation of ~14 angstrom resulted from the difference in the layer charge density of the samples (Na-2-mica < Na-3-mica < Na-4-mica) as revealed by 29Si and 27Al NMR spectroscopy in this thesis. The results from this thesis indicate that Na-n-micas (n=2, 3 and 4) are possible candidates for separation of Cu2+ from aqueous solutions of waste water or sea water. NH4+-SnP is a newly synthesized possible candidate for separation of transition metal ions from water, due to its layered structure with high interlayer spacing and high charge density and in addition, relatively higher stability in water compared with the recently synthesized H+-SnP material of ~15 angstrom.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15662], "author_name_tesi": "Xiong, Jie ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiong", "first_name_ssi": "Jie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni", "Fred Scott Cannon", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni, Thesis Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Member", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["layered materials", "ion-exchange", "metal separation"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Shape Dependence of Physical Properties of Polar Semiconducting Nanowires\n", "id": "7026", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5074", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semiconducting nanowires (SNWs) show promises as building blocks for nanoelectronics, optoelectronics and biological or chemical sensors. Due to their quasi-one-dimensional nature, research into the fundamental physical properties of nanowires has focused on quantum size effects, e.g., transverse confinement for electrons or phonons. However, the effects of the shape of nanowires on the physical properties of SNWs have not yet been systematically studied. In this thesis, we collect results from a series of experiments whose outcome is predicted to be, or shown to be, dependent on the shape of the nanowire. The term \u201cshape\u201d is taken to refer not only to the cross sectional geometric form (e.g., circle, hexagon, square, etc.) but also the aspect ratio A of the nanowire, where A is the ratio of the nanowire length to its minimum lateral dimension.\nFive studies made in this work point to the conclusion that \u201cshape matters\u201d in the physical properties of polar SNWs. These five studies are summarized in four chapters: (1) Automatic twinning superlattice formation in GaP and InP nanowires (Chapter 4); (2) Activation of surface optic phonons in cylindrical and rectangular GaP and ZnS nanowires (Chapter 5); (3) Extra phonon modes in cylindrical GaP nanowires (Chapter 5); (4) Raman scattering in individual cylindrical GaP nanowires by antenna effect (Chapter 6); (5) Nanomechanical properties of rectangular cross section ZnS nanowires (Chapter 7). In four of these studies, a clear experimental case is given for the impact of \u201cshape\u201d on the observations. In the 5th, the theory for small bending oscillations of a doubly-clamped nanowire has an explicit shape dependence for the resonant frequency, as predicted by the Euler-Bernoulli equation.\nThrough Raman scattering studies of ensembles, or individual polar SNWs, we have demonstrated that the shape (cross sectional shape and aspect-ratio) matters for the phonon properties. For example, we show that the modulation of the cross sectional area activates surface optic (SO) phonon Raman scattering. The modulation is identified with a nanowire growth instability. We show that the SO phonon dispersion is strongly dependent on the cross sectional shape. Furthermore, Raman data on individual polar SNWs reveal extra phonon modes, suggesting that the long-range dipolar interaction in SNWs is shape-dependent. Our interpretation of our Raman scattering results in GaP nanowires is that a high aspect ratio coupled with a sufficiently small nanowire diameter must lead to a splitting of the bulk LO and TO phonons into LOx+LOz and TOx+TOz where z is the direction parallel to the nanowire axis.\nThis thesis also presents several first observations, such as the automatic growth of twinning superlattices (TSLs) in III-V SNWs. The periodicity of the superlattice appears to be affected by DT=Tm - T, i.e., the degree of undercooling of the liquid phase in contact with the solid phase during VLS growth, where Tm is the melting temperature of the nanowire. We present results from two III-V systems (GaP, InP) in which the TSL is generated by the periodic 180\u00b0 flipping of the < > direction relative to the <111> growth direction of the nanowire. Superlattice coherence over at least ~ 500 nm has been observed. We suspect that our observations mean that a TSL structure can be grown in many compound semiconducting nanowire systems. Control of the TSL period should allow significant design possibilities for electronic, thermoelectric, thermal and electro-optic applications. Secondly, the first observation of a Raman antenna effect where the incident laser produces Raman scattering as if the individual nanowire was a dipole antenna. Interestingly, the effect is shown to require that the nanowire diameter  , where l is the excitation wavelength. Thirdly, we demonstrate a new internally self-consistent approach to measure the Young\u2019s modulus E of a nanofilament, i.e., by the new Force-deflection spectroscopy (FDS). We find by FDS that ZnS nanowire exhibits a value for E 30% less than that of the bulk. This depression of E seems to be a general and surprising outcome for nanoscale mechanics. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5050], "author_name_tesi": "Xiong, Qihua ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qihua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter C Eklund", "James Hansell Adair", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter C Eklund, Committee Chair", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antenna effect", "Raman scattering", "Phonons", "Semiconducting Nanowires", "Twinning superlattices", "Nanomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "BAYESIAN NONPARAMETRIC MODELING OF CATEGORICAL DATA WITH APPLICATIONS TO DYNAMIC DATA-DRIVEN SYSTEMS", "id": "14985sux101", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14985", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis proposes a Bayesian nonparametric model of categorical data, which\ncan be used for casual inference of time series, information fusion of heterogeneous\nsources and sequential pattern classification of complex dynamic systems.

PCC 6803 was studied to determine its role in carotenoid biosynthesis. Through complementation of a cruA mutant of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, and by in vitro assays with purified protein, the sll0147 product was shown to be a lycopene cyclase, converting lycopene, 1-hydroxy-lycopene and &#947;-carotene into &#946;-carotene. Sll0147 belongs to the newly identified family of lycopene cyclases, the CruA family, so Sll0147 has been re-designated as CruA of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.\nThe CruA of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was previously and indirectly shown to be a lycopene cyclase in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of that organism. Sequence comparisons show that the sll0147 product of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 shares 65% amino acid sequence identity with the CruA of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. A cruA deletion mutant of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, designated as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 &#916;cruA::aacC1, segregated fully. Unlike the wild-type strain, the &#916;cruA::aacC1 mutant accumulated lycopene, 1-hydroxy-lycopene and &#947;-carotene. By using the heterologous gene expression system in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 based on its endogenous plasmid pAQ1, two complementation strains were obtained based on the Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 &#916;cruA::aacC1 strain, named 7002_pAQ1::6803cruA-N(His)10 and 7002_pAQ1::6803cruA-C(His)6 respectively. Pigment analysis of these two strains showed the same pigments profile as that of the wild-type, demonstrating the sll0147 product had lycopene cyclase activity in vivo. In contrast, expression of these same proteins in Escherichia coli strains producing lycopene showed no activity. These data strongly suggested that E. coli strains were unable to produce an essential cofactor for activity of the sll0147 gene product. \nTo obtain additional information about the Sll0147/CruA protein, CruA was purified from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 expression strains by metal chelation chromatography of detergent solubilized membranes. The as-purified Sll0147 product was yellow-green in color due to the presence of non-covalently bound chlorophyll a and pheophytin a. Small amounts of lycopene and &#946;-carotene were also detected in the as-purified protein fractions. Gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry identified the yellow-green protein as the product of sll0147/cruA. \nThe as-purified CruA protein was able to convert lycopene and &#947;-carotene to &#946;-carotene in vitro. These enzymatic data provide the first direct evidence that Sll0147 and by extension other CruA proteins are lycopene cyclases capable of synthesizing &#946;-carotene from lycopene.

It is an information aggregation method that aggregates participants\u2019 information into a single prediction. Prediction markets have a wide range of real-world applications including predicting political events, sports competitions, current events, entertainment box office results, business sales figures, dates for scientific and technology breakthroughs, and more.\n\nThe content of this thesis can be divided into two parts. First, I describe the motivation for and history of prediction markets, along with prediction market applications, and mechanisms. Second, I review the limited research that combines prediction markets with social networks and describe my initial research in this area. The intersection of prediction markets and social networks is a promising area, since in most cases participants in prediction markets are actually interacting in some kind of a social network context, but such a context is often neglected in the modeling of prediction markets. In my research, I build on previous research by Chen et al [1], introducing  uncertainty to participant\u2019s beliefs, and analyze the effect on the prediction market, analyzed in particular its influence on market prediction accuracy, trading volume, and social network clustering. Two social network theories that motivate and help explain my experimental results are Festinger\u2019s theory[2] and Burt\u2019s theory[3]. Festinger\u2019s theory states that people with similar attitudes and perceptions tend to be attracted to one another, which changes the social network structure. Our experimental design follows Festinger\u2019s theory that people with similar Party registration tend to cluster together. Burt\u2019s theory asserts that overall network structure as well as individual network characteristics influence information flows. My results support this theory, showing that when participants are more clustered, the market has better overall prediction.\n\nMy preliminary study finds that adding uncertainty causes several effects: First, more uncertainty tends to reduce clustering. Second, and not surprisingly, more uncertainty tends to result in lower accuracy of information aggregation. Third, more uncertainty tends to cause lower trading volumes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6601], "author_name_tesi": "Xiong, Wenying ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenying", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Mullen", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Mullen, Thesis Advisor", "Tracy Mullen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["trading volume", "uncertainty", "information aggregation", "social network", "prediction markets", "clustering"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Preserving System Integrity in Commodity Computers", "id": "16202", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today people rely more and more on commodity computer systems for storing and processing information. To make computer systems more trustworthy, it is highly demanding that these systems could have integrity protection mechanism as the security basis of computing. In this dissertation, we propose proactive and reactive approaches to preserve system integrity for commodity computer systems.\n\nFirst, we explore reactive techniques to recover OS-level objects (e.g., processes and files) in an intruded computer system which already has integrity compromise. We design and implement SHELF, an intrusion recovery system that aims to preserve business continuity, availability and recovery accuracy. SHELF tracks activities of a computer system so that it can precisely determine which object of the system is compromised upon given an infection symptom. During the recovery phase, SHELF preserves accumulated clean state of infected objects, and it helps benign objects maintain their availability level to reduce system downtime.\n\nThe effort of repairing OS-level applications and files, however, must depends on a trusted and uncompromised OS kernel to provide correct functionality and abstractions. As commodity OS kernels are more and more becoming favorable targets for attackers, it is necessary to have proactive protection mechanism to secure the OS kernel and provide solid foundation for use-space security approaches. We study the problem of securing untrusted code executing in the kernel space, which is the major venue for OS kernel integrity compromise. We design and implement HUKO, a hypervisor-based integrity protection system that protects commodity OS kernels from untrusted extensions. In HUKO, untrusted extensions can safely run in the kernel space to provide desired functionality, but they are also confined by access control mechanisms, which significantly limit the attacker's ability to compromise the integrity of OS kernel.\n\nBased on the hypervisor architecture provided by HUKO, we further propose SILVER, a comprehensive framework that offers transparent protection domain primitives to achieve fine-grained access control and secure communication between programs in OS kernel. SILVER provides OS kernel developers the ability to specify security properties of their own code and data at the granularity of individual functions and data objects. Moreover, SIVER helps developers to prevent attacks exploiting kernel program communication, which cannot be effectively handled by typical isolation systems. To achieve such mechanism, we propose a novel resource management scheme of kernel data objects according to their security properties. Based on this organization, SILVER enforces access control and communication safety using hypervisor-based memory protection and run-time checks.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8084], "author_name_tesi": "Xiong, Xi ", "last_name_ssi": "Xiong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Sencun Zhu", "Trent Ray Jaeger", "David Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Trent Ray Jaeger, Committee Member", "David Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Software Security", "Operating System Security", "Virtualization", "Intrusion Recovery", "OS Kernel"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MODELING PEER ASSESSMENT SCORES IN MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSES: A BAYESIAN ITEM RESPONSE THEORY APPROACH", "id": "13809yzx110", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13809", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have proliferated in recent years in higher education and have become popularized for their features of open access and large-scale interactive participation.

The large scale of student population enrolled in a MOOC requires self-sustainable assessment methods. So far, machine automated grading and peer assessment have been two primary assessment methods in MOOCs. While the former is mainly used for multiple-choice questions, the latter is for open-ended assignment or projects.\n        A major concern about peer assessment is the lack of peer rater credibility in that peers may not be able to assign reliable and accurate ratings to their peers. In this study, a Graded Response Model (GRRM) with rater effect within a Bayesian framework is proposed and used to examine MOOC peer assessment. The model performance is evaluated under different simulated conditions, e.g., different missing data amounts, categories of rating scales, methods of assigning raters to assignments, and different MOOC-specific rating designs. Application of the model in a real-life MOOC peer assessment scenario is also illustrated to further demonstrate its applicability in real-life situations.\n        The results show that the proposed approach is robust to missing data. It is also found that ensuring balanced amount of raters per assignment and balanced amount of assignments assigned to each rater is the best method in terms of estimation accuracy. In addition, adding expert ratings in the model improves the estimation for ratee true ability scores while adding common assignments to be graded by all raters improves the estimation for rater effect parameters.

It is common to collect both repeated measures of risk factors (e.g., biomarkers) and time-to-event data for each subject, such as recurrent events and death. There are existing standard approaches to model the data separately. Mixed effects models are commonly used to model the association between repeated measures and covariates, which can incorporate the correlation among repeated measures. The Cox PH models or accelerated failure time (AFT) model are often used to estimate the covariate effects on the risk of the event. However, separate modeling may lead to biased results and are less efficient when the two processes are related through some unobserved variables. In many instances, the terminal event of death may prevent the observations and even the occurrence of any further recurrent events, but not vice versa. Thus, the common assumption of independent censoring for recurrent events is violated due to the competing risk of death because these two event processes are often correlated. For instance, if recurrent events (e.g., heart attacks) have a substantially negative effect on health condition, then the hazard for death could be increased. In addition, longitudinal biomarkers are often measured repeatedly over time for investigating their association with the event recurrence or death, thus identifying the candidate biomarker with enhance predictive accuracy is crucial for clinical practice. %Moreover, when the objective is to estimate the hazard of the events (e.g., death, cardiovascular disease) and the impact of prognostic biomarkers on the hazard of the event, a joint analysis taking their dependency into account is needed for valid inference. \n\nMotivated by the the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae in Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI) study, several challenges are recognized for joint modeling: 1) A certain large portion of subjects may not have any recurrent events during the study period due to non-susceptibility to events or censoring; 2) there exists left-censoring issue for some longitudinal biomarkers due to inherent limit of detection; 3) The correlation within matched cohorts need to be incorporated; 4) the informative censoring due to competing risk of death need to be adjusted. In this dissertation, first, we propose a joint frailty model with  zero-inflated recurrent events and death in a matched study, where a matched logistic model is adopted to adjust for structural zero recurrent events. We incorporated two frailties to measure the dependency between subjects within a match pair and that among recurrent events within each individual. By sharing the random effects, two event processes of recurrent events and death are dependent with each other. Furthermore, because of left-censoring of the assay used to quantify the marker, longitudinal data could be complicated by left-censoring of some measures. Next, we propose a joint model of longitudinal biomarkers, recurrent events and death which can accommodate left-censoring biomarkers.

A recent experiment breakthrough, cold compression of solid benzene into ordered product that is stable back to ambient condition, brought to the front stage a new sp$^3$ hybridized material which is also one dimensional, and this material, belonging in the category of one dimensional sp$^3$ carbon, has certain advantages over the previously considered polymers or nanowires: polymers have too much structural flexibility, nanowires are too wide that most of the atoms are still in the diamond bulk state. We name the material ``carbon nanothread''. \nFollowing a concise introduction in Chapter 1 of the structures and basic properties of carbon material classified by their hybridization and dimensionality and a practical introduction in Chapter 2 to the simulation methods used in studying carbon nanothreads, the author presents a systematic enumeration scheme to generate all the structure candidates for carbon nanothreads in Chapter 3, a work that has been published in early 2015. The visualization of the lowest energy structures and a brief discussion of their properties follow the enumeration scheme. In the later sections of Chapter 3, the author shows possible chemical reactions leading to these carbon nanothreads starting from benzene, along with the structures of intermediates, a work done not by the author himself but by the author's collaborators  and a work that is an important and integral part to understand the whole picture of nanothreads. Some on-going and proposed directions to utilize the physical properties of carbon nanothreads for applications are proposed in Chapter 3 as well. \nWith the structure candidates at hand, we are equipped to analyze the sample synthesized in experiments, by comparing the calculated observables of the candidate structures to the experiments, a topic of Chapter 4. Raman spectrum analysis is the most extensively studied one, and other experiments are also briefly mentioned. This part of the work is an on-going, unpublished effort.\nTuning the reactions pathways by using different precursors will be interesting, and boron nitride nanothreads naturally comes into consideration by the analog of boron nitride nanotube. Chapter 5 focuses on the structures of boron nitride versions of nanothreads, starting from a proposed molecular precursor and covering all the possible intermediates and mapping out potential reaction pathways. Due to the partial ionic nature of boron nitride compound and symmetry breaking, some aspects of the polarization of BN nanothread, having a density as large as the common ferroelectric material BaTiO$_3$, \nare discussed, envisioning possible applications. \nIn Chapter 6, the author's work prior to the nanothread efforts is presented. The work focuses on another category of carbon material: sp$^2$ hybridized carbon with true three-dimensional structures called ``Schwarzite'', a 3D structure with pores. A new structure design in this family of materials arises from the inclusion of a local carbon atom defect that has four nearest carbon neighbours but is embedded in the graphitic network. The role of such a defect in the possible synthesis of ordered Schwarzite structures is discussed.

All observations are potentially dependent on each other because they are interpreted as arising from a single equilibrium of settings where players interact directly or indirectly. Simple assumptions about the structure are made that ensure that the game with a fixed number of players has a unique equilibrium and the equilibrium has a stability property. The formulation of this stability property is new and is the basis for consistency. I introduce an estimation procedure called (sieve) maximum approximated likelihood. This estimator has the same asymptotic properties as the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator, but is easier to compute.\n\nCHAPTER 2: Estimation of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in Static Discrete Games with Correlated Private Signals\n\nThis paper studies a two by two static game of incomplete information. I allow players' private signals to be correlated, which adds complexity to Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) solutions of the game. Further, the econometric structure of this model is \u2018incomplete\u2019 due\nto the existence of multiple equilibria (Tamer (2003)). I therefore focus on a nontrivial subset of the support of public information variables (regressors), where a unique Monotone Strategy Bayesian Equilibrium (MSBE) exists. I propose a four\u2013step procedure to estimate the payoff structure. In the first step I estimate a set of parameters containing the underlying parameter of interest. I then obtain a point estimator in the second step and prove\nits consistency. The third and fourth step estimators are\nsquare n-consistent; the fourth step estimation is more efficient.\n\nCHAPTER 3: Semiparametric estimation of binary decision games of incomplete information with correlated private signals (with Yuanyuan Wan)\n\nThis paper studies the identification and estimation of a semiparametric binary decision game of incomplete information. We make no parametric assumptions on the joint distribution of private signals and allow them to be correlated. Focusing on Monotone Strategy Bayesian Equilibrium, we show that the equilibrium strategies can be represented by a binary choice model with an unobserved regressor, of which we find (estimable) upper and lower bounds. We show that the parameters of interest can be point\u2013identified subject to a scale normalization under mild support requirements for the regressors (publicly observed states) and errors (private signals). Following Manski and Tamer (2002), we use the modified maximum score estimator with estimated bounds and show its consistency.\n\nCHAPTER 4: Tighter Bounds in Triangular System (with Sung Jae Jun and Joris Pinkse)\n\nWe study a nonparametric triangular system with (potentially discrete) endogenous regressors and nonseparable errors. Like in other work in this area, the parameter of interest is the structural function evaluated at particular values. We impose a global exclusion and\nexogeneity condition, in contrast to Chesher (2005), but develop a rank condition which is weaker than Chesher\u2019s. The alternative rank condition can be satisfied for binary endogenous regressors, and it often leads to a tighter identified interval than Chesher (2005)\u2019s minimum length interval. We illustrate the potential of the new rank condition using the Angrist and Krueger (1991) data.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2286], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Haiqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haiqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joirs Pinkse And Sung Jae Jun", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse", "Sung Jae Jun", "Herman J Bierens", "Runze Li", "Barry William Ickes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joirs Pinkse And Sung Jae Jun, Dissertation Advisor", "Coenraad Arnout P Pinkse, Committee Chair", "Sung Jae Jun, Committee Chair", "Herman J Bierens, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Barry William Ickes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bayesian Nash Equilibrium", "Endogeneity", "Discrete Choice Model", "Monotone Strategy", "Triangular System"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Contributions to Adatpive Web Sampling Designs\n\n", "id": "7542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Investigation of the characteristics and estimation of quantities of hidden and hard-to-access population are of interest to scientists.

However, an important barrier that hampers the widespread use and practical implementation of PEM fuel cells is the lack of feasible polymeric electrolyte materials. Nafion and other analogous perfluorosulfonic acid polymers are currently the leading materials in this business, but they still present certain limitations. For example, they are not capable to work at temperatures higher than 90 oC and low humidification conditions. Elevating the working temperature of PEM fuel cells to above 100 oC is associated with a family of attractive benefits, including improved tolerance of electrodes to carbon monoxide, simplification of the cooling system and possible use of co-generated heat, and improved electrode reaction kinetics, etc. Moreover, perfluorosulfonic acid polymers fail to perform well in fuel cells fed with methanol due to the fuel crossover issue. Methanol is an important alternative fuel of choice to hydrogen, because it is free of massive production and distribution problems as for hydrogen. These issues lead to two major research thrusts in the current development of PEM materials, i.e. materials that can work at high temperatures (>100 oC), low humidities and that have low methanol crossover. This dissertation presents my recent efforts to overcome these materials challenges. A number of novel PEM materials have been created by rational design and sophisticated synthesis. \nIon-containing block copolymers hold promise as next-generation PEM materials due to their capability to self-assemble into ordered nanostructures facilitating proton transport over a wide range of conditions. Ion-containing block copolymers, sulfonated poly(styrene-b-vinylidene fluoride-b-styrene), with varied degrees of sulfonation were synthesized. The synthetic strategy involved a new approach to chain-end functionalized poly(vinylidene fluoride) as a macro-initiator followed by atom transfer polymerization of styrene and sulfonation. Characterization of the polymers were extensively carried out by 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetry analysis. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were applied to study the phase separation and self-assembled morphology. Strong dependence of ion exchange capacity, water absorption, morphology and proton conductivity on the degree of sulfonation has been found. It has been observed that the conductivities of the block copolymers are considerably higher than the random copolymers of polystyrene and sulfonated polystyrene possessing similar ion exchange capacities. \nCopolymers of vinylidene fluoride and perfluoro(4-methyl-3,6-dioxane-7-ene) sulfonyl fluoride containing amino end-groups were synthesized for the first time. The prepared amino-terminated polymers underwent cross-linking reactions with 1,3,5-benzene triisocyanate to form proton conductive networks. The chain-end crosslinked fluoropolymer membranes exhibited excellent thermal, hydrolytic and oxidative stabilities. The ion exchange capacity, water uptake, the state of absorbed water, and transport properties of the membranes were found to be highly dependent upon the chemical composition of the copolymers. The cross-linked membranes showed extremely low methanol permeability, while maintaining high proton conductivity at the same order of magnitude as Nafion. This unique transport feature gave rise to exceedingly higher electrochemical selectivity in relation to Nafion. The selectivity characteristics have been rationalized based on the formation of restrained ionic domains and the state of the absorbed water within the membranes.\nA series of new Nafion-based composite membranes were prepared via an in situ sol-gel reaction of 3-(trihydroxylsilyl) propane-1-sulfonic acid and solution casting method. The morphological structure, ion-exchange capacity, water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability of the resulting composite membranes were extensively investigated as functions of the content of sulfopropylated polysilsesquioxane filler, temperature, and relative humidity. Unlike the conventional Nafion/silica composites, the prepared membranes exhibit an increased water uptake and associated enhancement in proton conductivity compared to unmodified Nafion. In particular, considerably high proton conductivities at 80 and 120 \u00b0C under 30% relative humidity were demonstrated in the composite membranes, which are over 2 times greater than that of Nafion. In addition to a remarkable improvement in proton conductivity, the composite membranes displayed lower methanol permeability and superior electrochemical selectivity in comparison to the pure Nafion membrane. This work opens new opportunities of tailoring the properties of Nafion, the benchmark fuel cell membranes to obviate its limitations and enhance the conductive properties at high temperature/low humidity and in direct methanol fuel cells.\nA versatile and facile synthetic approach was developed for the preparation of a family of new ionomers with rigid aromatic backbones and pendant perfluorinated sulfonic acid groups. Variation in the chemical composition and structure of the new aromatic ionomers were performed to optimize PEM properties and fuel cell performance. The ionomers prepared from condensation polymerization of Sodium 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoro-2-(2\u2019,3\u2019,5\u2019,6\u2019-tetrafluoro-phenoxy)- ethane sulfonate and bisphenol monomers, e.g. hydroquinone, 4,4\u2019-biphenol, or their mixture with appropriate ratio, exhibited comparable or greater proton conductivity in relation to Nafion. New aromatic ionomers also showed other outstanding PEM properties, e.g. high Tg, low methanol permeability, excellent thermal and chemical stability and good mechanical properties. Initial fuel cell testing of these ionomer at elevated temperatures demonstrated superior performance to Nafion membrane, indicating great potential for use in high temperature fuel cells.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3647], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Kui ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing Wang", "Qing Wang", "Ralph H Colby", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qing Wang, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fuel Cells", "Polymer Electrolyte Membranes", "Proton Conductivity", "Methanol Permeability", "Electrochemical Selectivity."]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "study of a mumps virus from a outbreak in Iowa in 2006", "id": "18822", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8940", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mumps virus (MuV) is a negative sense, single stranded, non-segmented RNA virus belonging to Paramyxoviridae, Rubulavirus family.

Though clinical symptoms are generally mild, severe neurologic manifestations such as meningitis or encephalitis can develop during infection. Launching of an effective mumps vaccine program starting from 1968 in U.S. has dramatically reduced mumps incidences and well controlled the spreading of MuV for more than 30 years. Several large and ongoing mumps epidemics in vaccinated population in U.S. and other countries during the recent years have raised questions about mumps vaccination.

The way how interactivity influences consumers\u2019 information processing (Sundar, 2007) is very similar to what Kahneman (1973) hypothesized as the role of physiological arousal on individuals\u2019 cognitive functioning. Would arousal then function as an engine to magnify the effect of modality interactivity on consumers\u2019 cognitive processing? How would it affect modality interactivity\u2019s influence on consumers\u2019 attitudes and behavioral intentions toward product and the site? The arousal was treated as the other independent variable in this study.\n\nA 3 (interactivity: low, medium, high) \u00d7 3 (arousal: control, low arousal, high arousal) between- subjects factorial experiment was conducted to understand how modality interactivity and arousal affects consumers on the perceptual, cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral perspectives.

These findings imply that e-tailers need to be careful about where to employ interactivity features on the site and how many interactivity tools they would like to have without violating consumers\u2019 expectation of the site\u2019s interactivity. E-tailers would also have to decide what kind of outcome they would like to achieve and strike a balance between encouraging more elaboration and generating more engagement with website content while employing interactivity tools and embedding music. 4) It also identified how hedonic and utilitarian shopping orientation would moderate the effects of interactivity and arousal.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5039], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shyam Sundar Sethuraman", "Shyam Sundar Sethuraman", "Fuyuan Shen", "Michael Grant Schmierbach", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shyam Sundar Sethuraman, Dissertation Advisor", "Shyam Sundar Sethuraman, Committee Chair", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Member", "Michael Grant Schmierbach, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interactivity", "modality interactivity", "arousal", "e-commerce"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Nonlinear imaging and spectroscopy\n", "id": "11729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5083", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Developing advanced nonlinear optical microscopy and spectroscopy is the major theme of this thesis. Nonlinear microscopy and spectroscopy have found applications in many fields, such as biology, biomedicine and chemistry. This dissertation mainly focuses on two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy and spectroscopy. \nIn chapter two, development of a chromatic axial scanning method for two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging is described. Effective axial scanning is achieved by incorporating a Fresnel lens in the system, which has large chromatic aberration and can therefore focus the excitation beam to different axial positions depending on its wavelength. We experimentally demonstrated this technique and used it to image the cross-section of fluorescent microspheres.\nIn chapter three, time-resolved CARS impulsively excited by a supercontinuum laser beam is investigated. We show that it is critical to optimize the temporal overlapping of the constituent solitons of a supercontinuum in order to impulsively excite vibrational modes over a broader frequency range. It is also shown that the optical response function of molecules under supercontinuum impulsive excitation can be retrieved by utilizing the cross-correlation frequency resolved optical gating technique, and background-free CARS with spectral resolution significantly better than the bandwidth of the probe pulses can be achieved.\nIn chapter four, the optical Kerr gating effect was experimentally investigated by co-propagating a pump beam and a weak signal beam in a nonlinear photonic crystal fiber. It is shown that optical Kerr gating can be observed by using femtosecond pump pulses with only a few milliwatts of average power.\nIn chapter five, a novel approach for inline holographic coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy is demonstrated, in which a layer of uniform nonlinear medium is placed in front of a specimen to be imaged. The reference wave created by four-wave mixing in the nonlinear medium can interfere with the CARS signal generated in the specimen to result in an inline hologram. We experimentally and theoretically investigate the inline CARS holography and show that it has chemical selectivity and can allow for three-dimensional imaging.\nIn chapter six, the spectral holographic technique is applied to obtain the complex transmission and reflection coefficient of a free-standing metamaterial that has a zero index of refraction for wavelengths around 1550 nm by utilizing supercontinuum source. An excellent agreement between the experimental and modeled parameters is achieved which indicates this technique can be a powerful tool for charactering metametirials.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5058], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu", "Zhiwen Liu", "Iam Choon Khoo", "Qiming Zhang", "David Lawrence Allara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Chair", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["two-photon fluorescence", "nonlinear spectroscopy", "nonlinear imaging", "coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING REGIONAL VARIATION IN SPATIAL LANGUAGE: \nA CASE STUDY ON SPATIAL ORIENTATION BY USING VOLUNTEERED SPATIAL LANGUAGE DATA\n", "id": "11205", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5889", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis seeks to answer the question of how spatial language varies regionally within the same language on a geographic scale. Spatial language, such as route directions, is language pertaining to spatial situations and spatial relationships between objects. Spatial language is an important medium through which we study humans\u2019 representation, perception, and communication of spatial information. Existing spatial language studies mostly use data collected via time-consuming experiments, which are therefore limited to a small sample size\u2014thus limiting the detection of how spatial language varies from one region to another. More recently, larger sample sizes have become possible due to the abundance of volunteered spatial language data on the World Wide Web (WWW), such as directions on hotels\u2019 websites. This data is a potential source for scaling up the analysis of spatial language data. Sourcing from the WWW, a spatial language data collection scheme has been developed. Automated web-crawling, spatial language text document classification based on computational linguistic methods, and geo-referencing of text documents are used to build a spatially-stratified corpus. Focusing on route directions on the WWW, the Spatially-strAtified Route Direction Corpus (the SARD Corpus) with more than 10,000 spatially distributed documents covering three countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia) is built. As a case study on the SARD corpus, a linguistic analysis scheme assisted by computational linguistic tools is designed based on the often raised question of cardinal versus relative direction term usage. Semantic usages of cardinal and relative directions are identified as regional linguistic characteristics; a visual analytic toolkit is used to detect regional variations in the SARD corpus. Analysis results and possible indications of linguistic variations at the national and regional scale are presented and discussed, contributing to research on spatial language use. The analysis shows similarities and differences in directional term usages on the national level; regional level analysis shows that geographic patterns emerge on the linguistic term usage. The findings offer knowledge contributions to the field of spatial cognition; the design and implementation of building a geo-referenced large-scale corpus from documents crawled from the WWW offers a methodological contribution to corpus linguistics, spatial cognition, and the GISciences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5885], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Sen ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Klippel", "Alexander Klippel", "Alan Maceachren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Klippel, Thesis Advisor", "Alexander Klippel, Thesis Advisor", "Alan Maceachren, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["text classification", "geo-referenced web sampling", "volunteered geographic information", "information extraction", "machine learning", "spatial language analysis", "regional linguistic differences", "cardinal directional usage", "visual analytics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CHANGE TRAJECTORIES OF STRESS AND STRAIN DURING  A STRESSFUL EVENT: THE ROLES OF GROUP COHESION AND  GROUP MEMBERS\u2019 EMOTIONAL VARIABILITY", "id": "13808sxx103", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Employee stress is a significant issue in the hospitality industry, and it is costly for both employees and employers.

Specifically, informed by affective events theory and the homeostatic model of stress, this study investigated how stress predicts strain outcomes, including the need for recovery, emotional exhaustion, and sleep quality, and the change trajectories of stress and strain during a stressful event.

In line with affective events theory and the homeostatic model of stress, results showed that stress, need for recovery, and emotional exhaustion all displayed negative quadratic (inverted U-shaped) trajectories, and that sleep quality displayed a positive quadratic (U-shaped) trajectory. Group cohesion lowered the initial level of emotional exhaustion and increased the initial level of sleep quality. Group cohesion also flattened the linear trajectory of sleep quality over time. In addition, individuals working with group members with higher levels of emotional variability not only reported higher initial levels of stress, emotional exhaustion and need for recovery, but also higher systematic changes in their need for recovery and emotional exhaustion during the event.

When fully utilized, its energy density could reach 3-5 times that of currently marketed lithium ion batteries. This thesis describes the work focused on the development of cathode materials for high-energy lithium-sulfur batteries. More specifically, the design, synthesis, and characterization of cathode materials based on porous carbon-sulfur (C-S) composites are discussed.\n\nThe work described in Chapter 2 focused on tuning the pore structure of porous carbon in order to improve electrochemical performance of the C-S composite cathode material. It was found the pore volume of the porous carbon directly affect the practical energy output of the composite, as it limits the useful sulfur content in the composite. Meanwhile, the pore sizes of the porous carbon need to be restrained for desirable sizes of sulfur particles in the composites for satisfactory battery performance. These two parameters are competing and need to be balanced. The proposed porous carbon, HPC, affords a high pore volume with pore sizes restrained under 20nm. This carbon material can embed up to 80wt.% sulfur in its pore structure and still lead to exceptional battery performance. \n\nThe work described in Chapter 3 focused on forming secondary structure of C-S composite in order to improve its energy density (both gravimetric and volumetric). Besides the nano-structure, the exterior morphology of C-S composite particles is also critical for its battery performance as the cathode material. Syntheses focused on the nano-structuring without proper control of particle morphology normally result in particles too small for battery applications, plaguing battery fabrication and failing to reach the full potential of the electrode materials. This work took on the challenge to control multi-scale features in C-S composite. The proposed PSC porous carbon spheres not only have a high volume of nano-sized pores, but also exhibit desirable particle-size distribution for battery applications. The resultant C-S composite showed enhanced battery performance on various aspects, including tap density, areal capacity, and projected gravimetric and volumetric energy density of the whole battery. The proposed synthesis method is also highly scalable and versatile to incorporate extra building blocks into the C-S composite.\n\nThe work described in chapter 4 focused on functionalizing porous carbon to stabilize battery performance. Lithium-sulfur batteries severely suffer from performance decay because sulfur has diffusion loss in forms of lithium polysulfides. It was observed that nitrogen doping in carbon could significantly enhance carbon\u2019s adsorption of polysulfides, consequently mitigate the diffusion loss of polysulfides and performance decay. This work details the synthesis and characterization of nitrogen-doped porous carbon, the study of its enhanced interaction with sulfur and polysulfides, and improved battery performance from its sulfur composite.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9224], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Tianren ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tianren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donghai Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donghai Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rechargeable batteries", "lithium sulfur batteries", "porous carbon", "adsorption", "nanostructures"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Anti-Cancer Effects of Phenolic-rich Extracts of Button Mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus)", "id": "17505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8441", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Standard therapies for the treatments of cancer have limitations, including lack of effectiveness against hormone-refractory tumors and toxic side-effects. Dietary anti-cancer compounds have attracted increasing attention in cancer research because of their potential for lower toxic side effects and lower cost. Recent publications have shown that edible mushrooms are rich in phenolic compounds including simple phenolic acids and flavonoids. Given the available literature on the potential anticancer activity of phenolic compounds from other dietary sources, I hypothesized that the phenolic compounds in edible mushrooms can inhibit cancer cell growth. \nI compared the anti-proliferative effects of hot water, hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts of commonly consumed edible mushrooms against HT-29 human colon, H1299 lung, MCF-7 breast, and LNCaP & PC-3 prostate cancer cells using the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Brown button mushroom ethyl acetate extract (BBEA) had the most potent inhibition against cancer cell growth with LNCaP prostate cancer cells being the most sensitive (IC50 = 0.1 mg/mL after 48 h). A direct relationship was observed between total phenolic content and anti-proliferative effect of mushroom extracts. With further study, I observed that  BBEA time- and dose-dependently produced reactive oxygen species in cell culture medium in both the absence or presence of prostate cancer cells over 48 h treatment period. There was also a dramatic increase in the level of intracellular ROS and DNA damage response, indicating that BBEA-induced oxidative stress may represent the mechanism of prostate cancer cell growth inhibition. \nI used Western blot analysis, flow cytometry, and microarray analysis to study the anti-cancer mechanism of BBEA in prostate cancer cells. Increased cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was observed after treatment of prostate cancer cells with BBEA for 12 \u2013 24 h, indicating induction of apoptosis. BBEA arrested prostate cancer cells at G2 phase of the cell cycle and treatment with BBEA for 12 \u2013 24 h decreased cyclin D1, E2, A, and B1 expression in LNCaP cells compared to vehicle-treated controls. Based on microarray results, the expression of 34 genes involved in transcription regulation, cell cycle progression, DNA damage/oxidative stress response, cytoskeleton stabilization, cell proliferation, and polyamine catabolism was modified by BBEA. \nFinally I investigated the tumor growth inhibitory effects of brown (BBEA) and white (WBEA) button mushroom ethyl acetate extracts in LNCaP human prostate cancer cell xenograft-bearing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Tumor volume (mm3) and final tumor weight (g) were reduced by 18 and 22%, respectively, in mice fed a 0.5% WBEA-containing diet. By contrast, BBEA had no inhibitory effect. There was a discrepancy of growth inhibitory effect of BBEA between in vitro and in vivo models. The potential reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed.\nIn summary, phenol-rich button mushroom extracts inhibited prostate cancer cell growth in vitro, and caused apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. There was significant modulation of anti-proliferative genes by BBEA. These effects appear to be mediated in part by BBEA-induced oxidative stress. My present research provided the data to support the anti-cancer effects of button mushrooms and provides preliminary data for future mechanistic studies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8349], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Tongtong ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tongtong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Robert Bruce Beelman", "Ryan John Elias", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Member", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agaricus bisporus", "mushrooms", "cancer", "phenolic compounds", "apoptosis", "microarray", "SCID mice", "xenograft tumor"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Security and Privacy Mechanisms for Web and Third-party Applications", "id": "18796", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9175", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Web and third party applications are new forms of computer applications that heavily leverage the Internet and are compatible with various platforms such as PCs, tablets and smartphones.

A large user base reflects the unprecedented popularity of these applications. Unfortunately,the popularity of Web and third party applications has also drawn\nthe attention of attackers, who exploit the vulnerabilities within these applications\nand pose great security and privacy threats to the users. To defend against these threats, this dissertation proposes several security defense and privacy protection mechanisms for Web and third party applications. The mechanisms proposed in this dissertation focus on two most popular platforms, i.e., Web browsers and smartphones. On each platform, different approaches are developed to protect users from the most severe and the most representative threats observed in the real world.\n\nThe two most representative types of threats on Web browsers are JavaScript-based\nmalicious Web pages and worm propagation in online social networks. As the top Internet security threat in recent years, malicious JavaScript code often applies obfuscation techniques to hide its malicious purpose and to evade the detection of anti-virus software. To this end, we proposed an approach called JStill\nthat can detect and prevent the execution of the obfuscated malicious JavaScript code in Web browsers. The propagation of worms in online social network websites such as Facebook is new attack vector. Attackers leverage social connections and social engineering in online social networks to facilitate the propagation of worms. Given the new features in the propagation of worms, we proposed an early warning\ndetection system that can detect worms in online social networks when only a small number of user accounts are infected.\n\nAndroid is the most popular smartphone operating system. Android system enforces an installation-time permission check mechanism, which can not effectively prevent sensitive permissions from being granted to malicious applications. In view\nof this issue, we propose Permlyzer, a framework to automatically generate analysis on the use of permissions in applications.

Space-borne measurements indicate that TGFs typically consist of single or multiple pulses, last from a few tens of microseconds to a few milliseconds, and exhibit very hard energy spectra that extend up to a few tens of MeV. Recently, the observations by Astrorivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero (AGILE) have revealed photons in the high-energy part of TGF spectra with energies extending up to 100 MeV. Since their discovery, TGFs have been clearly identified to stem from bremsstrahlung emissions of energetic electrons in close association with lightning activity. Moreover, recent measurements of TGF-associated radio signals have correlated TGFs with the initial development stages of normal polarity intracloud lightning that transports negative charge upward (+IC). As one of the most powerful natural particle accelerators on the Earth, TGFs have attracted extensive observational and theoretical interests over the last two decades. \n\t\n\tAlthough numerous TGFs have been observed and various models have been developed, the production mechanism of TGFs remains a subject of active research. Two main production mechanisms have been proposed and provided consistent results with satellite measurements. The first mechanism is relativistic runaway electron avalanches (RREA) driven by the large-scale thunderstorm electric fields. This mechanism is now challenged by the recent discovery of extremely energetic gamma-rays in the high-energy tail of TGF spectra. The other viable mechanism is based on production of thermal runaway electrons by streamer discharges during negative corona flash stages of stepping lightning leaders. Strong support of this mechanism comes from the good agreements obtained between theoretical modeling and recent AGILE measurements. The purpose of the present dissertation is to improve our understanding of TGFs and the related phenomena by studying theoretically the underlying electron runaway mechanisms using Monte Carlo techniques. \n\n\t The first scientific question addressed in the present dissertation is that of the TGF production altitude. To tackle this problem, Monte Carlo modeling is used to simulate typical energy spectra at satellite altitudes based on the mechanism of direct acceleration of thermal runaway electrons in the lightning leader field. By comparing modeling results with RHESSI measurements, a source altitude of 12.4 km is determined for TGFs. This altitude appears to be deeper in the Earth's atmosphere and reconciles modeling results with recent radio observations of TGFs. Moreover, the properties of the photon source produced in this mechanism, including the beaming geometry and fluence, have also been quantified and are in good agreement with observational data-based studies. \n\n\tThe recently discovered, but unexplained, high-energy tail (up to 100 MeV) of TGF spectra is the second issue addressed in the present dissertation. Modeling results suggest that this high-energy tail can be explained using the production mechanism of thermal runaway electrons accelerated by the highly inhomogeneous electric field produced during the stepping of lightning leaders if extreme electric fields and potential drops are present. We also investigate the fundamental differences in energy spectra between this nonequilibrium acceleration process and RREAs developing in large-scale thunderstorm electric fields. \n\t\n\tDespite various satellite and radio signal measurements, little observational data are available characterizing the TGF source. Another scientific question studied is whether and which optical emissions are generated during the production of TGFs. Optical emissions resulting from the excitation of air molecules produced by the large population of electrons involved in TGF events have been theoretically quantified for both production mechanisms (RREAs and stepping lightning leaders). Detailed discussion of the role of excitation and ionization collisions on the formation of the electron energy distribution is also presented. Moreover, we show that electron energy distributions established from the two TGF production mechanisms are inherently different over the full energy range. The strong energy dependence of the capability of electrons to generate excited states responsible for optical emissions from neutral and ionized nitrogen molecules leads to intrinsic differences in optical emissions produced by different mechanisms of TGF production. It is found that TGFs are likely accompanied by detectable levels of optical emissions and that the distinct optical features are of significant interest for constraining and validating current TGF production models. \n\t\t\n\tIn addition to TGFs, bursts of neutrons have been discovered in close association with lightning discharges. Although the origin of these neutrons remains a mystery, it has been suggested that photonuclear interaction of the large fluxes of gamma-rays generated during the production of TGFs may be responsible for these events. To examine this mechanism, Monte Carlo model is employed to simulate photonuclear interactions between nuclei of air molecules and energetic photons involved in the production of TGFs. Modeling results suggest that significant amount of neutrons can be produced via photonuclear interaction undergone by high-energy photons resulting from the acceleration of thermal runaway electrons in the electric field of TGF-producing lightning leaders. Moreover, the energy distribution of these neutrons is quantified. \n\n\tIntense and brief bursts of X-ray emissions have been measured during both natural cloud-to-ground and rocket-triggered lightning flashes. The RREA mechanism has been clearly ruled out for these X-ray emissions. Based on the thermal electron runaway mechanism, we predict the photon energy spectra produced by 5 and 10 MV negative CG lightning leaders that would be measured from the ground using ideal detectors. The radial dependence of X-ray energy spectra received at ground level during the leader stepping process is also investigated. Furthermore, using full energy Monte Carlo simulations combined with an optical emission model, we quantify the optical emissions induced by the strong acceleration of thermal runaway electrons associated with these lightning leaders. Modeling results demonstrate that this acceleration process is accompanied with not only high-energy X-ray emissions but also detectable levels of low-energy optical emissions.

This work is motivated by the fact that 1D systems are realizable and highly controllable with ultracold atoms in optical lattice and atom chip experiments. We apply a recent worm algorithmic Monte Carlo approach developed for 1D continuous systems to study their equilibrium properties, both with and without an underlying lattice. We also apply an exact lattice approach based on the Bose-Fermi mapping to check our Monte Carlo results in the Tonks-Girardeau limit, and more importantly, to study far-from-equilibrium expansion dynamics of the systems.\n\nWe first study the scaling of one-particle correlations of the harmonically trapped Lieb-Liniger gas with changing temperature and interaction strength. Based on the universal behaviors of the density and momentum profiles, we are able to determine the effective parameters needed to fully characterize the system. We also find that the Tonks-Girardeau limit at low temperatures is the ideal regime for the experimental observation of the $1/k^4$ momentum tail. \n\nAn extra periodic lattice can drive the transition from superfluid to Mott insulator states. Exact and complete phase diagrams for such transitions are available only in the weak interacting and deep lattice limit, in which the system can be described using one-band Bose-Hubbard model. Beyond this limit, we use the worm algorithm in continuous space to map out the phase diagrams at various interaction strengths. We compare our phase diagrams with one-band Bose-Hubbard predictions and identify the regime where the one-band description breaks down. We introduce an inverse confined scattering solution to obtain effective Hubbard parameters, with which the Bose-Hubbard model provides correct results for strong interactions and deep lattices at unit filling.\n\nIn addition to the equilibrium properties, we also study the expansion dynamics of ultracold atoms in the hard-core limit. Experimentally, this is usually achieved by turning off confining potentials and letting atoms expand in optical lattices. Theoretical studies from initial ground states predicted the occurrence of fermionization of the momentum distribution after long expansion times. In addition, quasicondensation at finite momenta emerges when expanding from Mott insulating domains. Here, we develop a finite-temperature extension of the lattice approach for dynamics. We find the dynamical ferminoization of the momentum distributions at all temperatures. For expansion from initial Mott domains, we observe enhanced correlations reminiscent of dynamical quasicondensation. Surprisingly, we find the systems appear to cool down during the melting of the Mott domains. We use an emergent local Hamiltonian to understand these emergent phenomena.

The choice of using SFT is that SFT studies language through \u201ccontext of situation\u201d and reveals meaning potential in the context. Transitivity of SFT is compatible with Chinese language, and it provides a solution to the problem raised by Makoni, Lin and Schrauf who argue that the analysis is complicated because it is difficult to use Western views when analyzing Chinese texts. Transitivity and its 6 processes uncover subtle aspects of participants\u2019 performances in picture-elicited narratives, and thus they provide a detailed understanding of age impact which cannot be obtained otherwise. The research uses 60 Chinese participants whose age range is from 50 to 79 years old. The participants are equally divided into three age groups: A (50-59 years old), B (60-69 years old) and C (70-79 years old) with 10 males and 10 females in each group. The elicited narratives are secondary data from Paradis. In the present research, the narratives are encoded by two separate raters according to the coding system developed by the author who gives a great consideration to Paradis\u2019 stimuli and the six processes of transitivity. The present study uses General Linear Model in ANOVA to analyze the encoded data to find age impact on the participants\u2019 transitivity performances so that the participants\u2019 factors, levels and the interactions of factors and levels are taken into account. The results indicate that age can statistically have a significant impact on the participants\u2019 transitivity performances.

The significance of the present study is that it reveals the age impact on participants\u2019 transitivity performances in detail, and that it revises the previous researchers\u2019 general assertion.

Reading the Caldecott winners exposes children to meanings, meanings about what it means to be male or female. \n     This study presents an analysis of the meanings of femininity and masculinity produced in the different places conveyed in the Caldecott Medal winners from 1980 to 2007. In the Caldecott Medal winners, although a few studies consider the sex-role stereotypes, which have raised consciousness among more conventional publishers, award committees, authors, parents, and teachers, these studies premise on a binary consisting of two stable variables, male and female, and they do not tend to the books themselves as productive of meanings. Working from a poststructuralist feminist perspective, this study attends to the meanings of masculinity and femininity, and multiple interpretations of a particular text. Also feminist geographers influenced this study through their proposition that the relationship between gendered, class, racial identity and space is mutually constitutive. In other words, the spaces in which social practices take place affect the nature of those practices, and in turn, the constructed spaces receive meaning through the social practices that define men and women as different and unequal. \n     This study examines 24 Caldecott Medal winners from 1980 to 2007, and investigates the relationships between meanings about femininity and masculinity and four different kinds of places depicted in the winners\u2014home, public open spaces, workplace and displacement. This analysis suggests that while some medal winners continue to represent traditional versions of femininity in relation to the domestic sphere and traditional versions of masculinity in relation to the public space, many other winners convey complex and contradictory meanings about masculinity and femininity constructed in the different places. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6693], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Xu ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Gail Louise Boldt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Thesis Advisor", "Gail Louise Boldt, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Caldecott winners", "Space", "Poststructuralist feminism", "Gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Nation's Child: Childhood, Children's Literature and National Identity in Modern China", "id": "18706", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9193", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the final decades of the nineteenth century China saw profound changes. Militarily defeated by colonial powers and forced to sign a series of unequal treaties ceding parts of its territory, the thousand-year-old Chinese empire, under the rule of the Great Qing, painfully felt that it was going into decline. Under the threat of national extinction, progressive Chinese called for saving China by transforming it into a modern nation. This dissertation suggests that since the last decades of the nineteenth century China\u2019s modernization has been intricately intertwined with the construction of childhood and children\u2019s literature. I perceive my dissertation as a genealogy of modern childhood in relation to China\u2019s nation-building projects from the late nineteenth century to the present. This dissertation traces three paradigmatic shifts in regard to the correlation between the child and nation in modern Chinese history, by identifying the humanistic \u201cnatural\u201d child of the Republican period (1912\u20131949), the revolutionary adult-child of the Maoist period (1949\u20131976), and the patriotic modern child of the post-socialist period (1976 onward) as three ideal models of Chinese citizenship. While these models represent different dominant discourses about the child in the different historical periods of modern China, the model itself is not a homogeneous concept. That is, the meaning of each child model is unstable, contextualized by historical conditions marked in terms of nationality, gender, class, and age, as well as their intersections and disconnections. Additionally, it is also important to note that the specified historical periods are not distinctive historical eras having clear-cut boundaries. As I attempt to illustrate, the formation of the concept of the child in a so-called new era often builds on ideas of the past, and the past child usually figure prominently in the discourse of the ideal child of the present. Furthermore, the modern Chinese child and children\u2019s literature is never a purely indigenous product, but a hybrid of Western and local discourses. This dissertation thus also attempts to show that the local does not necessarily stand in opposition to the global and is often mediated through the transnational.

The proper functioning of metabolic pathways that are involved in sensing and management of nutrients is central to the integrity of metabolism. Originally identified as one of the mammalian eIF2alpha kinases sensing amino acid deprivation, GCN2 (general control nonrepressed 2) has been mostly studied on regulation of amino acid biosynthesis and protein translation. The recent discovery that GCN2 regulates hepatic lipogenesis upon leucine deprivation suggested a more complex role of GCN2 in metabolic control. To extend this study, I subjected global Gcn2 null (Gcn2 KO) mice to different nutrient stresses such as the total nutrient deprivation or high dietary fat feeding and the regulation of their physiological responses to these stresses was explored.\n\nI discovered that GCN2 is critical for lipid sensing and hepatic triglyceride storage. Gcn2 KO mice reared on the 21% (kcal %) medium fat chow (MFC) diet during perinatal stage and afterwards develop a significant low hepatic but high serum triglyceride (HiS/LoH) phenotype compared to wildtype mice. In contrast, Gcn2 KO mice under the 13% (kcal %) low fat chow (LFC) diet in the same period fail to display the HiS/LoH phenotype, even after further 60% (kcal %) very high fat diet feeding. The HiS/LoH phenotype is associated with reduced expression of PPARgamma, fat-specific protein of 27 kDa (FSP27) in the liver, which promotes efficient triglyceride storage. Further genetic studies indicated that GCN2 expression in the brain is required for regulating triglyceride accumulation in the liver. I speculate that during murine perinatal stage, GCN2 in the developing brain is an important sensor of triglyceride content in the maternal diet and programs fat storage in the adult liver.\n\n\nI also found that GCN2 is important for glucose production upon starvation. The Gcn2 KO mice have significant hypoglycemia and impaired glucose production after 24h fasting, despite normal expression of gluconeogenic genes. Impaired production of energy and reducing equivalents is indicated by the lower NADH/NAD+ (Lactate/Pyruvate) ratio in Gcn2 KO liver, which may contribute to the deficient gluconeogenesis. Studies in Gcn2 KO primary hepatocyte and Liver-specific Gcn2 knockout (LiGcn2) mice suggested that GCN2 expression in the liver is required for glucose production. Phosphorylation of eIF2alpha in the liver was proven to be critical for promoting C/EBPbeta translation. Here I showed that fasting induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation and C/EBPbeta expression in the liver is reduced in the absence of GCN2. The liver specific Cebpb knockout (LiCebpb) mice also display impaired glucose production, suggesting C/EBPbeta in the liver is indispensable for gluconeogenesis. My results indicate that GCN2 is critical for glucose production during fasting, which is mediated by translational modulation of C/EBPbeta in the liver. \n\nMy other project was aimed at the transcriptional regulation of Insig2a gene and its physiological importance. Insig proteins prevent protelytic processing of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP) and therefore are critical for down-regulation of cholesterol and lipid synthesis. Insig2a, a liver specific transcript of Insig2 gene, can be highly induced in response to fasting. I demonstrated that the induction of Insig2a mRNAs in the liver is ablated in LiCebpb mice during fasting. A response element named as Insig2ab2 within intron 1 region of Insig2 gene was identified to bind with C/EBPbeta and induce Insig2a transcription. LiCebpb mice also show elevated cholesterol content in the liver after fasting, although expression of cholesterologenic genes is normally repressed. My results show that C/EBPbeta is a critical transcription factor regulating Insig2a transcription and may control cholesterol homeostasis in the liver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6692], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Xu  ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xu ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Gong Chen", "Douglas Cavener", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Dissertation Advisor", "Gong Chen, Committee Chair", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GCN2", "FSP27", "Triglyceride Storage", "Insig2a", "C/EBPbeta", "Gluconeogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Forces And Moments Generated By The Human Arm: Variability And Control", "id": "23550", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10830", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " To move and manipulate objects people exert forces and moments of force (further addressed as simply \u201cmoments\u201d) on the environment. The five studies in this dissertation explored the accurate endpoint force vector production by the human arm in isometric conditions. In the first study, three common-sense hypotheses were proposed and falsified. The subjects exerted static forces on the handle in eight directions. The forces were of different magnitude levels. The torsion moment on the handle (grasp moment) was not specified in the instruction. The two force components and the grasp moment were recorded, and the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joint torques were computed. The following main facts were observed: (a) While the grasp moment was not prescribed by the instruction, it was always produced. The moment magnitude increased with force magnitude and moment direction changed with the instructed force direction. (b) The within-trial angular variability of the exerted force vector (angular precision) did not depend on the target force magnitude. (c) The time profiles of joint torques in the trials were always positively correlated, even for the force directions where flexion torque was produced at one joint and extension torque was produced at the other joint. (d) In contrast to the previously studied tasks, the analytical inverse optimization (ANIO) method failed to determine the optimization cost function.  A hypothesis was formulated that this is a general property of the static tasks performed by the serial kinematic chains.  In the second study, the preceding findings in the first study were confirmed in tasks where arm postures were systematically varied. Further, it was observed that the distribution pattern of endpoint force variability is dependent on the arm posture instead of the orientation of trunk. A following-up simulation was conducted to examine why the pattern of the joint torques distribution could not be explained by an optimization cost function additive with respect to the torques. The results suggested that the grasp capability might serve as the limit to a more optimal pattern of the joint torques distribution. In the third study, handle size was varied to test its effect on performance. Major results indicated: (a) There existed effects of handle size on the magnitude, but not on the distribution pattern of MVC end-point force. (b) Changing the handle diameters in the range between 4.5 and 9.0 cm does not affect the maximal torque production. (c) Although systematic change in the coefficients of ANIO was observed, the method still failed to reconstruct an optimal cost function additive with respect to joint torques with large handle size.   In the fourth study, two handles with different surface friction were used to characterize its effects on grasp moment and further on the endpoint force. It was found that: (a) No significant differences in the MVC forces existed between the low- and high- surface friction handles; (b) A higher surface friction led to a higher grasp moment magnitudes; (c) Higher surface friction resulted in lower variability of force direction and higher enslaved moment at a specific direction. In the fifth study, grasp moments were prescribed or canceled out by using rotatable handle, and the results showed that: (a) Rotatable handle did not change the MVC forces significantly; (b) At the force level of 30% of MVC, using the rotatable handle didn\u2019t lead to different variability of force magnitude and directions at all prescribed directions; (c) Exerting of the prescribed grasp moment reduced the MVC force production; and (d) Exerting of the prescribed grasp moment led to higher variability of both force magnitude and direction.

Compared to foreland basins and passive margins where the subsidence histories follow consistent patterns, forearc basins exhibit a wide range of subsidence characteristics, owing to multiple driving mechanisms such as sedimentary and tectonic loading. In addition, accretionary forearc basins are particularly sensitive to changes in margin geometry related to wedge dynamics. Sequence stratigraphic analyses of forearc basin fills can be used to constrain the tectonic and depositional controls on basin evolution in this type of setting. Here, sequence stratigraphic analysis of a high-resolution 3-D seismic volume in the Kumano forearc basin located offshore SW Japan was used to decipher the relative timing and pattern of infill in the lower portion of the basin. Sediments in this lower unit were deposited in a paleo-outer wedge setting and sit stratigraphically above the present-day inner accretionary prism and below upper forearc sediments. Stratal terminations were mapped to identify depositional patterns and unconformities that signify major basin reorganizations. In-depth mapping of a lower drape-like sub-unit revealed three distinct stages of downlap that each span ~0.5 Myr. Evidence from these stratal patterns suggests that, in addition to the fill-and-spill model of ponded basin assemblages such as those caused by salt tectonics in the Gulf of Mexico, episodic uplift and deformation of the accretionary prism significantly affected early evolution of the Kumano Basin. This emphasizes the interplay between the dynamic generation of accommodation in accretionary prism depositional systems and sediment distribution, and contrasts with passive margins where eustatic sea level change plays a more significant role.

Plant-level decisions for R&D investment, physical capital investment, entry, and exit are developed using a dynamic industry evolution model. Estimates of the structural parameters are used to quantify how a plant\u2019s productivity is affected by its own R&D and by spillovers from the R&D of its competitors. In contrast to previous R&D studies, which usually investigate a collection of producers from various industries, this paper characterizes how the full set of dynamic decisions by each plant in a single industry interact with its own and its competitor\u2019s productivity change. This allows the model to provide a detailed set of pathways connecting the plant-level R&D investment, productivity, physical investment, and turnover patterns observed in the data.\nThe empirical model is estimated in two steps. In the first step, a model of static market competition is used to estimate the demand elasticity, returns to scale in production, and the process of plant level productivity. The initial productivity distribution for new entrants is also recovered. In the second step, a Simulated Method of Moments estimator is used to estimate the cost of R&D, the magnitude of the R&D spill-over, adjustment costs of physical investment, and the distribution of plant scrap values. To circumvent the computational burden of solving the industry equilibrium with a large number of plants in the second stage estimation, I apply the recent approximation method of Weintraub, Benkard and Van Roy (2005). \nCHAPTER 2: Entry and Exit in Geographic Markets (with Timothy Dunne, Shawn Klimek, and Mark Roberts).\nIn this paper we estimate a structural model of firm entry and exit developed by Pakes, Ostrovsky, and Berry (2004) that can identify three separate components of the competitive process: the effect of an increase in the number of firms on the average profits of firms in a market, and the magnitudes of entry costs and firm scrap values that are key determinants of the degree of firm turnover.\nThe empirical model is used to analyze the entry and exit patterns of establishments in two medical-related service industries, dentists and chiropractors. Using micro data collected as part of the Census of Service Industries, we measure the number of establishments, the flows of entering and exiting establishments, the average revenue and average profits for 754 small geographic markets in the U.S. at five-year intervals over the 1977-2002 periods. We use a three-step estimation procedure. In the first stage, the profit function parameters are estimated. In the second stage, we estimate the continuation and entry values directly by computing the average of the discounted values of future cash flows that establishments actually earned in the data up to the parameter of the scrap value distribution. Finally, the scrap value and entry cost distributions are estimated by maximizing the probability of observing the flows of entering and exiting establishments in the data. \nCHAPTER 3: Macroeconomic Implications of Size-dependent Policies (with Nezih Guner and Gustavo Ventura)\nGovernment policies that impose restrictions on the size of large establishments or firms, or promote small ones, are widespread across countries. In this paper, we develop a framework to systematically study policies of this type. We analyze a simple growth model with an endogenous size distribution of production units. We parameterize this model to account for the size distribution of establishments and for the (observed) large share of employment in large establishments. We then measure the cost of policies that distort the size of production units including their impact on productivity measures, the equilibrium number of establishments and their size distribution. We find that these effects are potentially large: policies that reduce the average size of establishments by 20% lead to reductions in output and output per establishment up to 8.1% and 25.6% respectively, as well as large increases in the number of establishments (23.5%).\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6798], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Bee Yan Roberts", "James R.

PCC 7002 was characterized with respect to its transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in response to several environmental cues, and its physiological roles in oxygenic photosynthetic conditions. To improve carbohydrate production, the glycogen biosynthesis pathway in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was abolished by inactivating the genes encoding two glycogen synthases, GlgA1 and GlgA2, which led to accumulation and excretion of small sugars and osmoprotective carbohydrates (e. g. glucose, sucrose, glucosylglycerol), especially in osmotic stress conditions. Furthermore, a general expression system was developed to facilitate gene expression at any locus of the chromosome or endogenous plasmids in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Particularly, the expression system pAQ1Ex, using the high-copy endogenous plasmid pAQ1, has been successfully constructed with a relatively strong, constitutive promoter PcpcBA for high-yield gene expression, or with an inducible, moderate strength promoter PnrtABCD for regulatable gene expression by changing the medium nitrogen source. These expression systems have greatly facilitated genetic and metabolic engineering studies in this cyanobacterium. For instance, overproduction of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 glbN gene encoding the hemoglobin helped to discover its protective functions against challenges from reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS); overexpression of genes encoding the Ralstonia eutropha NAD(P)+-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase led to the first successful overproduction of an active [NiFe]-hydrogenase and its maturation system in a heterologous cyanobacterial host. Further indications from hydrogenase overproduction studies suggest that reductant availability to hydrogenases is an important limiting factor for physiological H2 production. In addition, overproduction of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 lactate dehydrogenase (LdhA) resulted in high level organic acid production (lactate, acetate and formate) in a CO2-level-independent, continuous, and photoautotrophic manner.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6935], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Ashley Bryant", "Donald Ashley Bryant", "John H Golbeck", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Stephan C Schuster", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Ashley Bryant, Dissertation Advisor", "Donald Ashley Bryant, Committee Chair", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Stephan C Schuster, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbohydrate", "metabolic engineering", "biofuel", "cyanobacteria", "hydrogen", "gene expression", "organic acid", "co-culturing"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Efficient parameter estimation methods using quantile regression in heteroscedastic models", "id": "14148zux106", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The quantile regression method, first introduced by \\citet{koenker1978regression}, provides a comprehensive toolkit of performing statistical inference for a class of statistical models and has become an important surrogate for the conventional least squares method. Specifically, quantile regression offers several versatile approaches to produce highly efficient estimates, regardless whether the error distribution is homoscedastic or not.\n\nThis dissertation is concerned with developing some efficient estimation methods for both the regression parameter and the dispersion parameter under the parametric nonlinear heteroscedastic model. The proposed methods have their roots in quantile regression and rely heavily on large-sample properties of the estimates. \n\nIn Chapter 2, we estimate the parameters by solving the ``double-weighted composite quantile regression (DWCQR)'' optimization problem. We establish central limit theorems for both estimates, based on which we recommend an objective way of choosing the optimal weights for both the quantile losses and the heteroscedasticity. It is shown by theoretical calculation that the resulting estimates are typically more efficient than those obtained from other methods, and their asymptotic variances converge to the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds as the number of quantile positions tends to infinity. An adaptive estimation procedure is reported at the end of this chapter.\n\nThe computational aspects of the DWCQR problem are discussed in Chapter 3. Although the DWCQR problem, in general, does not admit numerical solutions that are guaranteed to converge, we attempted to provide an algorithm that combines the MM algorithm (\\citet{hunter2000quantile}) and the linear programming. The proposed MMLP algorithm overall works well and successfully confirms the nice theoretical properties of the DWCQR estimates using the optimal weights. The Monte Carlo study demonstrates that the DWCQR method outperforms the conventional estimation methods for the models under investigation. \n\nIn Chapter 4, for simplicity, we restrict the regression function to be linear and consider an alternative efficient estimation approach, which is based on a preliminary estimate $\\hat{\\alpha}_n$ of the dispersion parameter. We first derive the Bahadur representation of the regression quantile $\\hat{\\beta}(\\tau)$ for fixed $\\tau$. It is then interesting to note that the effect of the $\\hat{\\alpha}_n$ propagates in the asymptotic representation of $\\hat{\\beta}(\\tau)$. Such asymptotic bias brought by $\\hat{\\alpha}_n$ can be eliminated by averaging regression quantiles across different quantile positions with a set of carefully chosen weights. In the meantime, it can be shown that these weights can be\nsimultaneously adjusted so that the resulting estimate is also asymptotically efficient.

Thanks to advances in both hardware and software, modern smartphones provide innovative features to third party applications (a.k.a., apps) running on their platforms. Those features, including various onboard sensors and notification services, have been widely applied in third party applications. They allow the developers to build innovative third party applications. Also, they greatly improve the interactive\nexperience for phone users.\n\nAs these features and their provided services are becoming more and more popular, concerns are raised about whether the features and the services they provide might introduce security vulnerabilities to the smartphone or cause private information leakages of phone users. Because these features are newly introduced and never appear on the previous dumbphones, they have been barely studied from the perspectives of security and privacy in previous literatures. \n\nIn this dissertation, we present our studies focusing on two types of popular features on smartphones: onboard sensors (and the sensor services they provide) and notification services. For each feature, we elaborate our studies from both the attack side (i.e., exploring attack approaches on phone users utilizing the feature) and the defense side (i.e., proposing designs and solutions to prevent potential\nfeature-based attacks).\n\nFor the onboard sensors on smartphones, we present a study of inferring a user's tap inputs on a smartphone with its integrated motion sensors. Specifically, we utilize an installed trojan application to stealthily monitor the device movements and gesture changes of a smartphone using its onboard motion sensors. When the user is interacting with the trojan application, it learns the motion change patterns of tap events. Later, when the user is performing sensitive inputs, such as entering passwords on the touchscreen, the trojan application applies the learnt pattern to infer the occurrences of tap events on the touchscreen as well as the tapped positions on the touchscreen.\n\nTo manage the onboard sensors and prevent sensor-based attacks, we propose a privacy-aware sensor management framework, called SemaDroid, which extends the existing sensor management framework on Android to provide the comprehensive and fine-grained access control over onboard sensors. SemaDroid allows the smartphone user to know the sensor usage of every installed application, specify context-aware and quality-of-sensing based access control policies, and enforce the policies in real-time. Further, considering the trade-off between functionalities of installed third party applications and privacy of users, SemaDroid provides a privacy bargain feature that allows users to control the disclosure of sensing information while keeping the application running.\n\nFor the notification service, we show that notification customization may allow an installed trojan application to launch phishing attacks or anonymously post spam notifications. Through our studies on four major smartphone platforms, we show that both Android and BlackBerry OS are vulnerable under the phishing and spam notification attacks. iOS and Windows Phone allow little notification customization, thus launching the phishing and spam attacks will expose the identity of the trojan application. Our notification service studies point out the important vulnerability of lacking view authentication in the existing view-based smartphone platforms.\n\nTo prevent the user from being tricked by the phishing notification and to locate the malware application spreading phishing and spam notifications, while still allowing notification customization, we propose a Semi-OS-Controlled notification view design principle and a Notification Logging service. Moreover, to protect applications from fraudulent views, we propose a view authentication framework, named SecureView, which enables the third party applications to add the authentication image and text to their sensitive views (e.g. the account login view). \n\nThe design, implementation, demonstrations, and evaluation of proposed attack and defense approaches are elaborated in the dissertation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8089], "author_name_tesi": "Xu, Zhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Xu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Sencun Zhu", "Guohong Cao", "Tom La Porta", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Tom La Porta, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phone sensing", "notification services", "sensor management", "security and privacy in phone", "trojan application", "spam and phishing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Locally Stationary Quantile Regression For Inflation and Interest Rates", "id": "27213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There has been an extensive literature on understanding the role of interest rates and inflation in financial markets. Under some assumptions on the conditional expected real return, Fama's (1975) study about the predictability of the inflation from the interest rates has long attracted attention. However, as Fama focused on the conditional mean return but ignores the distribution of the return, two distributions with the same mean can have completely different shapes, focusing on the mean only may overlook other important aspects of the distribution. Moreover, Fama assumed that the relationship between inflation and interest rates is constant over time. Such stationarity can hardly be justified and the potential nonstationarity of interest rates could pose serious challenges in statistical inference.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a time-varying locally stationary quantile regression (LSQR) model for the conditional quantile of inflation on the past inflation and interest rates, with the quantile-specific coefficients varying with time nonparametrically. The proposed model not only captures information about the distribution of the return but also exhibits time-varying dependence between the inflation and interest rates over long time span. We consider the LSQR model under both efficient market settings and non-efficient market settings. For each case, as the model is approximately stationary in short time period, we study nonparametric estimations for the time-varying and quantile-specific coefficients in the model and demonstrate their asymptotic behaviors under appropriate conditions. The proposed methodology is also demonstrated through both simulation data and an empirical analysis of the U.S. Treasury Bill.

A lot of descriptive studies have been done in this field but intervention studies are rare. The present research used a new hybrid intervention method which covered three domains of narrative development, linguistic complexity, evaluative information, and story grammar. Thirty children (mean age 4;6 years) participated in this study.  Before and after the intervention, the children\u00a1\u00afs skills were evaluated for language and in three different tasks of narrative ability. Fifteen children were assigned into the intervention group and the other 15 children who were closely matched with the intervention group on their pretest languages skills served as the control group. In six weeks, the 15 intervention children received 12 intervention sessions which lasted for 30 minutes each time. After the intervention, the intervention group showed improvement in all three narratives tasks that were employed. Specifically, they recalled more information and used more complex sentences in the story retelling task. The intervention group in the story telling task included more evaluative information and more story grammar components in their story narratives. The stories generated by the intervention group in the story telling task also included more complete episodes than the control group children did. For the personal narratives, the intervention group produced narratives which were more structurally complicated. In a sentence recalling subtest from the Clinical Evaluations of Language Fundamentals (CELF-preschool) as well as a composite language Z score, the intervention group received significantly higher score than the control group children.

Further, the intervention results support the theoretical notion that rapid narrative skill growth will occur when narrative challenges were interwoven dynamically with favorable emotional, motivational, and scaffolding conditions during adult-child interaction.\nBecause narrative skills are important for reading and other academic activities, it is suggested that interventions such as the present hybrid intervention would be valuable tools in preschool and kindergarten curriculum. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6933], "author_name_tesi": "Xuan, Yue ", "last_name_ssi": "Xuan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keith E Nelson", "Carol Hammer", "Judith Fran Kroll", "Jeffrey G.

Recently multiferroics attract enormous attentions due to the rich physics and potential applications such as information storage memories. As two important multiferroic materials, BiFeO3 and hexagonal manganites are the focus of the research in this dissertation. \nAn antiferroelectric phase is defined as an antipolar crystal with antiparallel cation displacements of neighboring unit cells. The ferroelectricity and antiferroelectricity in Sm-doped BiFeO3 system are described by a three-dimensional phenomenological model based on the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory. The temperature-, pressure-, and composition-induced ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase transitions are discussed. The constructed temperature-composition and temperature-pressure phase diagrams show that compressive hydrostatic pressure and Sm doping have similar effects on the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phase transitions. It is also indicated from the temperature-pressure phase diagram that the experimentally observed phase of BiFeO3 under the hydrostatic pressure from 3GPa to 10GPa is a PbZrO3-like antiferroelectric phase.\nBesides spontaneous polarization, BiFeO3 also shows a structural instability, i.e. oxygen octahedral tilt. Due to the rigidity of the oxygen octahedra and the corner-sharing feature of the oxygen octahedral network, the domain wall energy of the oxygen octahedral tilt has a strong anisotropy with respect to different wall orientations. Based on this, a rotational compatibility condition is proposed to identify the low-energy domain walls in perovskites with oxygen octahedral tilt instability. Applying the rotational compatibility condition to BiFeO3, the unusual ferroelectric domain wall width and energy are successfully explained based on the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire theory.\nVortex domains in ferroic materials refer to the flux-closure domains in which polarization or magnetization vectors rotate around a point. It is shown that the polarization vortex domains are induced in the BiFeO3 films grown on an electrically insulating substrate. Based on the example, the crystallographic, electric, and strain conditions are proposed to produce spontaneous vortex domains in a ferroelectric film or superlattice. The vortex domains in BiFeO3 give rises to a net curl of the polarization vectors, which is shown to be reversible under external electric fields. The vortex domains in the rhombohedral system without the oxygen octahedral tilt are also studied, which show that the oxygen octahedral tilt has a strong effect on the vortex wall orientations.\nBiFeO3 shows a rhombohedral (R) crystal structure as bulk materials, and exhibits in R-like phases in the films under a small epitaxial strain. However, recently a tetragonal (T)-like phase is induced by a large compressive strain (larger than 4%). In the dissertation, a Landau-theory-based potential is proposed to describe both the R-like and T-like phases in the BiFeO3 films. The common tangent construction in the phase stability analysis indicates the R/T phase mixture. Based on phase-field simulations, the domain wall orientations of the R/T mixed phases are determined, which are in good agreement with experimental measurements.\nDifferent from the perovskite structures of BiFeO3, hexagonal manganites exhibit in a layered hexagonal structure. Hexagonal manganites are a type of improper ferroelectrics with polarization induced by a structural distortion, called trimerization. The trimerization and polarization result in six domains in hexagonal manganites, which can cycle around a point and form a topological defect. Taking YMnO3 as an example, the three-dimensional (3D) domain structure and vortex evolution are studied based on the phase-field method using a thermodynamic potential constructed from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrating the possibility of predicting 3D complex mesoscale structural evolution starting from DFT. The temporal evolution of domain and vortex structures allows us to fully explore the mesoscale mechanisms for the vortex-antivortex annihilation, and domain wall motion under external electric fields. It is demonstrated that the vortex motion and vortex-antivortex annilation control the coarsening dynamics of domain structure evolution.  \nThe domain structures with topological defects in YMnO3 also show intriguing collective behaviors, which are statistically analyzed based on the phase-field simulation results. It is found that the domain coarsening rate agrees well with the predication of the classical XY model in two dimensions, but shows an unexpected deviation in 3D. Our computational studies suggest that such a deviation arises from the anisotropy in the hexagonal system. In addition, the topological defects in YMnO3 form two types of domain networks: type-I without and type-II with electric self-poling. The frequencies of domains with N-sides, i.e. of N-gons, in a type-I network are fitted by a lognormal distribution, whereas those in type-II display a scale-free power-law distribution with exponent ~2. A preferential attachment process that N-gons with a larger N have higher probability of coalescence is responsible for the emergence of the scale-free networks. Since the domain networks can be observed, analyzed, and manipulated at room temperature, hexagonal manganites provide a unique opportunity to explore how the statistical distribution of a topological defect network evolves with an external electric field.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11361], "author_name_tesi": "Xue, Fei ", "last_name_ssi": "Xue", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Qiang Du", "Clive A Randall", "Venkatraman Gopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Landau Theory", "Phase-field Simulation", "Phase Transitions", "Domain Structures", "Bismuth Ferrite", "Hexagonal Manganites"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Numerical Methods for Multiphysics, Multiphase, and Multicomponent Models for Fuel Cells", "id": "8725", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2150", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, we design and analyze efficient numerical methods for obtaining accurate solutions to model problems arising in fuel cells.

We construct a sequential equilibrium in pure strategies that sustains cooperation for sufficiently patient players. The notion of sequential equilibrium is extended to extensive form games with infinite time horizon and additive payoffs across time. The strategy is embedded in an explicitly defined expectation system, which is a more compact way to describe strategies than machines in the local interaction setup, although essentially the expectation system can also be viewed as a finite state automaton. The belief system is derived by perturbing the strategy appropriately and following the principle that parsimonious explanations receive all the weight. The equilibrium has the property that after any global history, full cooperation will be restored after a finite number of periods. Therefore, the explicitly defined expectation system serves as a social norm. What matters is not a common observation of a physical outcome, what matters is a common understanding of the social norm, the understanding that everybody knows the norm and is willing to follow it after any history.\n    \n    The second essay deals with coordination games. By adding a small amount of noise to the information structure, the theory of global games is able to select a unique equilibrium in coordination games with a finite number of players and two actions, a safe action and a risky action. As the noise vanishes, however, it is often the case that positive amount of inefficiency remains in the selected equilibrium. This essay argues that this is partly due to the simultaneity of the moves. If the game is played sequentially with the order of moves determined endogenously, and if the risky action is irreversible and the safe action is reversible, then efficiency will be asymptotically restored as the noise vanishes. However, if the safe action is irreversible, then dynamics will not make much difference to the possible inefficiency of equilibria. Thus two coordination games may look very similar if they are treated as simultaneous move games, yet they can be very different if they are treated as sequential move games. For example, there has been much recent interest in the phenomenon of currency attacks and its similarity to the well-known model of bank runs. However, we show that these games are quite different in the dynamic setting and endogenous timing might help to resolve inefficiencies in the first but not the second.\n    \n    In the third essay we propose to use Polya urn processes to model the emergence of order in an environment where people interact with each other sequentially and indirectly, through a common physical facility. Examples include rewinding video tapes, erasing blackboards, and flushing toilets, etc. We find that a minimum amount of imitation is able to generate a maximum level of conformity.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3221], "author_name_tesi": "Xue, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Xue", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Nezih Guner", "Vijay Krishna", "Tomas Sjostrom", "Susan Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Nezih Guner, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Tomas Sjostrom, Committee Member", "Susan Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cooperation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Rural tourism and the reconstruction of rural identity in China", "id": "26312", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11446", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tourism has become a worldwide phenomenon and an increasingly recognized tool for regional development, especially in remote and underdeveloped areas (Fleischer & Felsenstein, 2000). In China, tourism development has been used as a pro-poor strategy by local government to diminish poverty and increase the living standards of rural residents (Su, 2001). Although the economic and social aspects of rural tourism development have been widely examined and debated, little attention has been paid to the impact of rural tourism development on the cultural construct of rural life (i.e., residents\u2019 rural identities). In this study I explored the role of tourism development in changing rural identities in the context of China, which has been experiencing rapid urbanization and rural reconstructing processes in recent years. \nTo understand the features of local residents\u2019 rural identity change and its underlying mechanism, I conducted a case study in Chongdu Valley, a popular and pioneering rural tourist destination in the middle of China from June to August 2014. Through the collection of on-site materials, participant observation, and individual interviews, my study: 1) examined the patterns of local residents\u2019 rural identity changes and the underlying reasons behind the changes; 2) explored the detailed transformation of everyday life and performance of rural residents, and how it has influenced the mentality and identity of Chongdu Valley residents; and 3) compared and contrasted different discourses on tourism development issues and their implications for community power relations. \nThe results indicated that rural identities in Chongdu Valley did experience changes over the course of tourism development. The changes included recognition of the good associated with living a rural life, a change in residents\u2019 perspectives from rural-urban inequality to rural-urban difference, and a rise in community identity. These changes can be attributed to the shift in national government policies towards rural populations and the local economic and environmental changes brought by tourism development. Daily interaction between rural residents and urban tourists also helped to reconstruct rural identities as it either reinforced or diminished rural-urban differences.     \nThe results also indicated that tourism has provided local residents with an alternative way of living that has greatly changed their life as a rural resident. They have developed a new rural identity from being a farmer to being a businessperson (Bye, 2009). As their experiences accumulated, they were able to acquire a new set of skills, which included, but were not limited to, external networking, marketing, cooking, room service, house and room design, and managing debt. Non-work related activities and mentalities with respect to leisure, consumption, and education were also explored as they were directly influenced by residents\u2019 changes in livelihood. \nMy analysis also revealed that, in spite of congruence on issues of destination image and overall development outcomes, the local community and the private company that is in charge of Chongdu Valley management,  presented conflicting discourses, and thus divergent values, theories, and attitudes towards a range of community and tourism development issues. The private company, which occupies an influential and dominant position when it comes to decision making and strategy implementation, is dealing with the issues in its own way, but it may not take long for residents to challenge the authority of the private company. Further, without community participation, Chongdu Valley faces environmental degradation and growing problems with inequality.\nThe findings of the study enrich the tourism field\u2019s understanding of the cultural impacts of rural tourism development on local communities, especially related to identity change and reconstruction. Through examining residents\u2019 changing rural identity, this study provides insight to the rural-urban relationship in China and how it is being transformed along with the ongoing process of rural restructuring. Theoretically, the study contributes to existing knowledge of the intersection of tourism and identity by focusing on a less conventional setting in which identity is constructed by multiple forces instead of only cultural difference. Methodologically, the study introduces the framework of rural performance to the tourism field and discourse analysis to community tourism research.

Specifically, the covariates for each subject are repeatedly observed at a sequence of time points, while the response is measured at one single time point, typically, at the end of the study. Such data are different from those in standard longitudinal models, where both response and covariates are repeatedly collected for each of many subjects.\n\nWe first develop models for scalar response with discrete longitudinal covariates, when the covariates can be characterized by a distribution from an exponential family. Recognizing that the observed longitudinal covariates are often subject to measurement errors while the true subject-specific profiles are unobservable, we propose a two-stage calibration regression procedure to estimate the effect function using the natural cubic smoothing spline technique. The performance of the proposed estimation procedure is compared under various circumstances via a set of simulation studies. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated population profile function in the longitudinal covariate model are established, while allowing the number of observation time points to diverge as the sample size increases. A slight extension of the model is further proposed to accommodate an extra clustered random effect, then adopted in a study of alcoholic couples.\n\nIn many drug and alcohol studies, the longitudinal covariates are counted values with excess of zeros. Thus, special techniques for handling the zero inflation are considered. Specifically, we propose estimating the longitudinal covariate processes through a hurdle model with zero-truncated Poisson distribution.

To characterize the kinematic evolution within the Taiwan orogen, detailed structural mapping, strain analyses, and 40Ar-39Ar dating were conducted along the eastern Central Range, Taiwan.  \nThe earliest deformation within the eastern Central Range involves west-vergent folding and development of a slaty cleavage/schistosity with fiber overgrowths and progressive deformation of chlorite-mica aggregates.  This deformation was followed by left-lateral shearing and east-vergent backfolding that deformed the earlier fabrics.  \nA regional west-to-east variation exists in extension direction from down-dip to along-strike across Taiwan.  The regional extension pattern reflects a triclinic displacement field fixed to the geometric framework across Taiwan.  The sinistral shear is indicative of strain partitioning associated with the margin-parallel shearing.  Observations of the structure history within the Taiwan orogen are generally consistent with the predictions of doubly-vergent wedge model.\nBy using 40Ar-39Ar dating, the matrix and whole-rock mixing ages of a pre-Tertiary basement sample containing syntectonic biotite fibers within the eastern Central Range is determined as 9.8\u00b13.8Ma and 4.1~3.3Ma, respectively.  The whole-rock mixing age of a slate sample from the eastern slate belt is determined as 28~33Ma.  Our dating results establish that the development of current fabrics within Taiwan is due to the ongoing collision.  The deformation instability due to the mechanical response of rock anisotropy developed in the foreland is the reason for multiple cleavages in the hinterland during ongoing collision.  \nA new method based on mechanical models of inclusion deformation during folding is presented.  Given inclusion-shape distributions on the limbs and the fold geometry, this method can differentiate between folding mechanisms and provide an estimate of the strain in folds.  The method can also help to constrain the deformation behavior of inclusions and to investigate the rheologic properties of inclusions and surrounding matrix.  Numerical simulation of porphyroclast deformation by forward and inverse modeling was completed on an anticline from Slatedale, Pennsylvania.

To enhance critical thinking, three design principles, 1) authentic task, 2) question prompts, and 3) peer interaction, were associated with the learning activities for two consecutive years.  \nThe research context was within a large general science course and the learning activities for a module were designed, implemented and refined for two years. Specially, changes in design strategies were made in the two design principles, question prompts and peer interaction, after the 1st implementation. With regard to the use of question prompts, the students of the 2nd year were provided with procedural and elaborative question prompts, while those of the 1st year only received procedural question prompts embedded in the Group and Community Discussion Charts. Second, instead of being engaged six times in two types of discussions, group and community discussions, the students of the 2nd year were required to take part in a community discussion twice and to prepare for the discussion by learning about and understanding important aspects of dealing with the hurricane situation.

As a result of localization, vibration energy is confined to a small number of substructures, and the dynamic behavior of periodic structures can be drastically changed.  Consequently, the localization effect could significantly impact the health of such nearly (mistuned) periodic structures. \nExtensive studies exist concerning mode localization and forced response of nearly periodic structures.  Most investigations have focused on exploring the cause of localization, developing methods to quantify the degree of localization, and predicting the maximum forced response.  A few studies have explored means to reduce or eliminate localization effect.  Recently, Tang and Wang (2003) proposed a new piezoelectric networking concept for mode delocalization of nearly periodic structures and have shown promising results.  This thesis aims to further extend the state of the art of delocalization and vibration control of nearly periodic structures via piezoelectric networking technology.\nFirst, piezoelectric networking for mode delocalization is further investigated analytically and experimentally.  An active coupling enhancement approach via negative capacitance is proposed for improving the effectiveness of the network for mode delocalization.  The analysis is conducted using the transfer matrix approach and Lyapunov exponent.  A localization index is defined from the correlation between Lyapunov exponents and the localized modes of the electromechanically bi-coupled system, and is used in a comprehensive parameter study.  Experiments are carried out to validate the delocalization concept on a bladed disk specimen.  The effect of negative capacitance on the network\u2019s performance is also investigated. Both analysis and experiments verify that the mode localization level of mistuned periodic structures can be effectively reduced by the piezoelectric network, and the performance of the network can be further improved by the active coupling enhancement approach via negative capacitance.  \nThe investigation on the piezoelectric networking is then extended to vibration suppression of the mistuned bladed disk.  Due to the localization effect, mistuned bladed disks in turbo-machinery often suffer from large forced response. This study provides a comprehensive analysis on piezoelectric networking for effective multiple harmonic vibration suppression of mistuned bladed disks.  The analysis consists of two parts.  In the first part, the bladed disk is modeled as a multi-blade periodic system with disk dynamics neglected. A piezoelectric network is designed and optimized analytically after applying the U-transformation technique.  The effectiveness of the optimal network for multiple harmonic vibration suppression is demonstrated and compared to the traditional absorber design.  Monte Carlo simulation is performed to further examine the effectiveness of the network for mistuned bladed disk systems.  Robustness issues associated with key circuitry elements are also investigated.  An approach via negative capacitance to improve the system performance and robustness is explored.  The analysis shows that the piezoelectric network is quite effective and robust for multiple harmonic vibration suppression of mistuned bladed disks, and the performance and robustness can be further improved by negative capacitance.   Based on the analysis in the first part study, we then extend the investigations to a more complex scenario.   A bladed disk model with coupled blade-disk dynamics is developed to better describe the actual system and correspondingly, a new multi-circuit piezoelectric network is proposed and optimized analytically for multiple harmonic vibration suppression.  The performance and robustness issues of the network are examined numerically via Monte Carlo simulation.  Finally, experiments are carried out to demonstrate the multiple harmonic vibration suppression effect of the newly developed piezoelectric network.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2361], "author_name_tesi": "YU, HONGBIAO ", "last_name_ssi": "YU", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "HONGBIAO", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["VIBRATION CONTROL", "PERIODIC STRUCTURE", "VIBRATION LOCALIZATION", "PIEZOELECTRIC"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The differential requirement for vitamin D and vitamin D receptor in iNKT cell development", "id": "10125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5890", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CD1d-reactive natural killer T (NKT) cells with an invariant T cell receptor V&#61537;14 rearrangement are a unique subset of lymphocytes, which play important roles in immune regulation, tumor surveillance and host defense against pathogens. Vitamin D is a nutrient/hormone that has been shown to regulate conventional T cell responses, but it remains unclear whether it regulates iNKT cell development and function.  Here we determined the effect of both the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the vitamin D ligand (1,25(OH)2D3) on iNKT cell development. The data show that expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as well as vitamin D is required for normal development while only the VDR is required for normal function of iNKT cells. Moreover, the receptor and ligand regulate iNKT cell development by different mechanisms. The iNKT cells from VDR KO mice are intrinsically defective and lack T-bet expression. VDR KO iNKT cells fail to express NK1.1 although they express normal levels of CD122. Extrinsic factors that impact iNKT cell development and function in the VDR KO mice included a failure of the liver to support homeostatic proliferation and reduced thymic expression of CD1d and other factors important for optimal antigen presentation in the thymus. In addition, VDR KO iNKT cells were intrinsically defective even when wild type antigen presenting cells were used to stimulate them. Similar to what was shown in VDR KO mice, fewer iNKT cells were identified in the 1,25(OH)2D3-deficient mice. However, 1,25(OH)2D3-deficiency did not affect the function of the remaining iNKT cells. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3-deficiency did not affect the development of iNKT cells in the thymus, while VDR KO iNKT cells were blocked at the CD44+/NK1.1- stage of development. The 1alpha-hydroxylase (encoded by Cyp27B1) is an enzyme required for production of 1,25(OH)2D3. Cyp27B1 KO mice are 1,25(OH)2D3 deficient because they cannot convert vitamin D to the active form. Cyp27B1 ko/+ breeders were fed vitamin D deficient diets. At three weeks of age WT and Cyp27B1 KO littermates were weaned and fed diets that are vitamin D-deficient for the next 5 weeks. Analysis of iNKT cells from these mice showed that both the WT and Cyp27B1 KO littermates had very few iNKT cells.  In fact the percentage of iNKT cells in the liver of vitamin D deficient mice was very low 1.2-1.8% and lower than in the VDR KO mice (6%). Early exposure to vitamin D in utero is required for iNKT cell development and iNKT cells failed to recover in either WT or Cyp27B1 KO littermates that were 1,25(OH)2D3 fed from the age of 3-8 wks. Taken together, the data indicate that both the VDR and vitamin D are required for iNKT cell development. Furthermore, there are differences in the role of the VDR and the vitamin D ligand in iNKT cell development. In addition, the data suggest a critical role for vitamin D early during neonatal development or the first 3 weeks post-birth in inducing iNKT cells.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5886], "author_name_tesi": "YU, SANHONG ", "last_name_ssi": "YU", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SANHONG", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Avery August", "Robert Paulson", "Na Xiong", "Terryl Johnson Hartman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vitamin D", "vitamin D receptor", "iNKT cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "CORRECTION OF ESTIMATION BIAS IN EVALUATING THE LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES OF YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL-BASED LEARNING PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n", "id": "6256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6562", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nEvaluations of training programs, among others, have struggled with the prevention of estimation bias, especially when examining programs using non-experimental data. Alternative econometric approaches have been developed to correct for this estimation bias. This bias is mostly due to discrepancies in observed and unobserved characteristics between the participants and the counterfactual. The purpose of this study is to explore the unbiased estimates derived from alternative corrections and compare variation in predictive effectiveness among different corrections from evaluations of school-based learning (SBL) programs.\nThis study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 97 (NLSY 97), a non-experimental database, to evaluate the effects of U.S. youths\u00a1\u00a6 school-based learning (SBL) program participation on early labor market outcomes. Estimates from ordinary least squares regression, the linear regression with probabilistic matching or instrumental proxy, are compared to those obtained from bootstrapping regression analysis. Four outcome variables, including employment in college, employment, total worked hours and hourly wage rate, are used to gauge the early labor market outcomes of youth from the NLSY 97.\nFindings, at an alpha level of .05 when the first type of instrumental variable (IV) correction method is adopted, reveal that SBL program participants are significantly less likely than non-participants to enroll in college, and that SBL program participants have a lower probability of enrolling in college than do non-participants. \nIn comparison with college enrollment, findings from the analysis of employment and total worked hours outcomes on SBL program participation are not statistically significant with selection bias corrections. Rather, only the estimates derived from the Tobit regression for the correction of the censored data show that SBL program participants have a lower number of total worked hours than do non-participants. Due to evidence which shows that youths\u00a1\u00a6 wage differential is small in the early labor market, the findings from Heckman\u00a1\u00a6s two-step correction with an alpha level of .10 show that SBL program participants are more likely to have higher hourly wages than non-participants.\nIn addition, in looking at the seven specific types of SBL program participation, the significant likelihood of enrolling in college or being employed, all of the estimates derived from Heckman\u00a1\u00a6s two-step correction show no significance. \nFor the total worked hours outcome, the correction of the censored data using the Tobit regression shows that internship/apprenticeship program participants have lower total worked hours than non-participants, with an alpha level of .001. \nDue to the small wage rate differential for youth in the early labor market, a significance level of .10 is used for this outcome. Heckman\u00a1\u00a6s two-step correction reveals that SBL program participants are more likely than non-participants to have higher hourly wage rates. In view of the seven types of SBL program participation, the findings from Heckman\u00a1\u00a6s correction reveal that internship or apprenticeship program participants are more likely than non-participants for all SBL programs to have a higher hourly wage rate.\nIn summary, this study shares corrected estimates from alternative approaches. Based on criteria from the 200-time and 500-time bootstrapping, the best selection bias estimation among these four corrections uses Heckman\u00a1\u00a6s two-step correction.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6560], "author_name_tesi": "YU, WEI-TING ", "last_name_ssi": "YU", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "WEI-TING", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edgar Paul Yoder", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Kenneth Gray", "David Lynn Passmore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gray, Committee Member", "David Lynn Passmore, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["school-based learning", "selecton bias", "NLSY 97", "program evaluation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF AN ANIMATED AGENT WITH INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES IN FACILITATING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OF DIFFERENT \nEDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES IN MULTIMEDIA LEARNING\n\n\n", "id": "8356", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2182", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an animated agent that provides instructional scaffolding strategies via a story mnemonic or cuing question with feedback versus instructional scaffolding strategies alone on student achievement of different educational objectives in multimedia learning.

Experiments are conducted in two distinct experimental setups employing different flow configurations and flow restrictions. In the first experiment, comparison of the effects of 90-degree and 45-degree elbows on interfacial structures and their transport characteristics in horizontal two-phase bubbly flow is investigated. The setup is made out of 50.3 mm inner diameter glass tubes and a double-sensor conductivity probe is used to collect time averaged local data.  Experimental results show that both elbows have significant effect on the development of interfacial structures as well as the bubble interaction mechanisms.  Furthermore, there are characteristic similarities and differences between the effects of two elbows.  While the effect of the 45-degree elbow is evident immediately after the elbow, the 90-degree elbow effect is propagated further downstream of the elbow. Moreover, it is shown that both the elbows induce oscillations in the interfacial structures and two-phase flow parameters, but the degree and the nature of oscillation differ. Comparison of the elbow effect on the axial transport of two-phase flow parameters is also investigated. \nThe second set of experiments is performed in combinatorial two-phase flow facility to study the effects of 90-degree vertical elbow and geometric configuration on two-phase bubbly flow.  The elbow has a significant effect on two-phase flow regime transition boundaries at measurement locations downstream of the elbow.  Modified two-phase flow regime maps based on the extensive flow visualization studies are suggested for both vertical and horizontal test sections.  A four-sensor conductivity probe is employed to measure time averaged two-phase local parameters as the flow develops along vertical upward to horizontal section across the 90-degree vertical elbow.  The elbow causes the bubbles to align along the horizontal radius of the pipe cross-section, creating a bi-peaked profile in void fraction and interfacial area concentration.

In view of this, the current study performs experiments to investigate the geometric effects of 90-degree vertical elbows in air-water two-phase flows and develops a one-group IATE applicable to vertical-upward-to-horizontal two-phase flows.  The experimental facility consists of both vertical and horizontal sections constructed from 50.8 mm inner diameter acrylic pipes that are interconnected via 90-degree glass elbows.   The elbows have a radius of curvature of RC/D = 3 and are installed at L/D = 63 and 244.7 from the inlet.  Experiments are performed to characterize the elbow-effect on both global and local two-phase flow parameters. A four-sensor conductivity probe is used to acquire detailed measurements of local two-phase flow parameters at thirteen axial locations along the test section in eight flow conditions that are within the bubbly flow regime at inlet. The measurements show that in bubbly flow conditions, the vertical-upward elbow causes a characteristic bimodal-type bubble distribution and the change in this distribution farther downstream of the elbow corresponds to the dissipation of the elbow-effects.  In view of developing the IATE for vertical-upward to horizontal two-phase flows, predictive models for the dissipation length of the elbow-effect and closure relations for advection of gas-phase, pressure loss, and covariance of bubble interactions are developed.

This represents one of the few viable examples of utilizing nanomotors towards a medical treatment.  Repair of damaged tissues has also been expanded to curing dental ailments. Dental caries or bacterial cavities can also be detected and cured using the same underlying mechanism. This approach also offers the first explanation on why fluoride treatment works for general dental well-being. \nRestoration of biological cracks has also been expanded onto polymerized surfaces. The mechanism involved varies from diffusiophoresis, in that it is density driven rather than being electric field driven. Complete repair of cracked surfaces is observed in real time.\nDiffusiophoretic motion is then applied to polymeric systems where a fluoride ion triggered colloidal pump is designed. The pump is a versatile starting ground that is expanded into designing a bacteria scavenging material as well as systems that show first signs of memory.\nThis thesis concludes with perhaps the most exciting chapter that brings new light to enzymatic cascades, the intricate systems that allow for the perpetuity of life on earth.

The two major challenges that exist when processing a suspension of colloids are controlling the stability of the particles in the system and promoting accurate particle self-assembly. Traditionally, stabilization is accomplished through the passivation of particles with dispersant molecules, which allows for the synthesis of simple structures such as films and uniformly ordered colloidal crystals. However,\npassivation often prevents downstream bottom-up assembly processes.\nCurrent assembly methods go beyond simple colloidal crystal packed structures to produce close-packed and isotropic structures. These simple and new assembly structures are limited by photolithography, functionalizing chemistries, and the fact that they are made up of the same material. The work described in this thesis created simple, localized and nanoscale charge distributions on the surfaces of individual colloidal particles using the technique of particle lithography.

This vast layer of our planet drives plate tectonics as it redistributes heat and mass with large-scale convection cycles. While analytical geochemistry and numerical modeling have enabled researchers to uncover many properties of Earth\u2019s dynamic mantle, our understanding is not yet complete. Geochemical studies of mantle-derived materials such as basalts and peridotite xenoliths have revealed that the mantle is compositionally heterogeneous on a large scale. These heterogeneities offer insights into the controlling factors in mantle processes. The use of lithium as a geochemical tracer holds promise for mantle studies due to the large variation in Li isotope ratios in natural materials and the structural compatibility of Li in mantle minerals. High lithium diffusion rates coupled with the potential for isotope fractionation during diffusion complicate the interpretation of lithium signals in mantle materials, but create the opportunity to discern the rates of mantle processes.  Minerals such as olivine and diopside, found in mantle xenoliths from diverse localities, exhibit unexpectedly large differences in 7Li/6Li ratios, usually with lighter Li found in the diopsides. Because 6Li diffuses faster than 7Li, bulk lithium exchange between two phases could result in dynamic isotopic fractionation, with the receiving phase becoming lighter and the donating phase becoming heavier.  Thus if Li becomes more compatible in diopside upon cooling, that is, if DLi(ol/di) is temperature-dependent, the diffusive exchange of Li will generate temporary 6Li enrichment in diopside and depletion in olivine.  This thesis explores the hypothesis that a temperature-dependent partition coefficient for lithium between olivine and diopside is responsible for the divergent lithium isotope ratios measured between these two minerals in mantle xenoliths.\nThe conditions causing the different isotope ratios between phases can be inferred by comparing Li concentrations and isotope ratios measured in natural samples to experimentally determined equilibrium distributions between olivine and diopside for various temperatures and pressures. However, the equilibrium elemental distributions and isotope fractionation factors for lithium in mantle minerals at high temperature and pressure are largely unknown. Experiments were conducted using a piston cylinder apparatus at 700 \u00b0C, 900 \u00b0C, and 1100 \u00b0C and 1.5 GPa (1-10 days) to determine DLi(ol/di).  San Carlos olivine and De Kalb diopside were finely ground for starting materials, and Milli-Q water with 100 ppm Li and 500 ppm Ba served as the lithium source.  Lithium concentrations in olivine and diopside from experiments held for 1, 3, 5, and 10 days were determined by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  Partition coefficients (DLi(ol/di)) from experiments conducted at 700-1100 \u00b0C are, within error, the same, 2.2 (\u00b1 0.3), suggesting that DLi(ol/di) is not temperature dependent.

This study explores a group of college students\u2019 understanding of the NOS, with a particular emphasis on the sociological NOS understanding and the social view of science. The study participants completed an implicit and contextualized NOS instruction, a College Peer Review (CPR) project. The CPR project was designed to engage college students in an authentic scientific investigation through its original research, on-line collaboration, and peer review. The phenomena under investigation were changes in students\u2019 conceptions of the NOS and their experiences with the activities of the CPR project. The design of this investigation was a collective case study, it was instrumental with multiple cases. Five science education college students were purposively selected from a class of 21, all of whom participated in the CPR project. The primary data were collected through pre and post interviews. A semi-structured NOS interview protocol designed by the researcher guided the interview conversations. The protocol questions searched for interviewees\u2019 understanding of the selected NOS tenets. Another semi-structured interview protocol was utilized to illuminate participants\u2019 experiences with the activities of the CPR project. The secondary data were collected through an on-line philosophy of science questionnaire, before and after the CPR activities. Using another on-line questionnaire, participants\u2019 demographics and other relevant information were collected. The interviews\u2019 verbatim and participants\u2019 written responses were analyzed utilizing the constant comparative method. Within-case analyses were performed to identify participants\u2019 pre and post conceptions of the NOS and their experiences with the CPR project. The commonalities of changes in participants\u2019 conceptions of the NOS and their experiences with the project, derived from a cross-case analysis, were reported as the study findings. The analyses revealed that students\u2019 understanding of the NOS were changed and in the sense developed, in favor of a more social constructivist view of science. The dramatic differences observed in participants\u2019 pre and post responses were in their conceptualizations of the sociological NOS. After the project was completed, participants portrayed science as socially constructed. Participants did not change their positions regarding the empirical, tentative, subjective, value-laden, and a human endeavor characteristics of science but they enhanced their arguments regarding the sociological NOS. It was expected that students would not change their positions regarding the aforementioned tenets of the NOS, because the project did not deliver some NOS ideologies explicitly. The analyses of experiences with the CPR project revealed that participants mostly liked the original research and large scale aspects of the project. Participants found the online peer review aspect of the project unique. They reported that they would use a similar peer review system with their students when they begin teaching. Participants suggested not utilizing anonymous feedback, but making the reviewers known to the authors. According to the participants, providing eponymous feedback would improve the quality of the reviews. Better coordination of campuses to provide prompt feedback, the use of different organisms in addition to plant seeds, and second time experimenting were some of the other recommendations made by the students. \nThe sociological NOS is often not addressed in the research context of teaching about the NOS, though it lies on the border between the logical positivist and the social constructivist views of science. Peer review as commonly used in real scientific practice is an important aspect of science and it has the potential to illustrate to students how scientific knowledge is generated. Peer review is not currently taught in schools as part of the scientific method(s). An instructional strategy that draws upon the sociological NOS and peer review can provide meaningful insights in teaching and learning about science and the NOS. This study promotes teaching the NOS tenets through authentic scientific activities. The research findings provide evidence that students construct an understanding of the sociological NOS when they are provided with opportunities to engage in the implicit and contextualized NOS instruction, in which the sociological NOS and authenticity of scientific practice guide the activities.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [872], "author_name_tesi": "Yalvac, Bugrahan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yalvac", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bugrahan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Carlsen", "Wenda K Bauchspies", "Carla Zembal Saul", "Thomas M Dana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Carlsen, Committee Chair", "Wenda K Bauchspies, Committee Chair", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member", "Thomas M Dana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nature of science", "Science education", "Sociology of Scientific Knowledge", "Peer Review", "Sociological Nature of Science", "Scientific Literacy", "Authentic Scientific Investigations", "Philosophy of Science"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 and King-devick test as a protocol of concussion evaluation: establishment of normative data in football", "id": "21842", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9943", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3) and the King-Devick (K-D) test are clinical sideline assessment tools developed to evaluate concussions. The SCAT3 is composed of several tests in a variety of concussive domains including symptoms, cognitive and physical evaluation, attention, concentration, balance assessment, and coordination. SCAT3 takes 15-20 minutes to administer, and is the most widely used on-the- field concussion evaluation instrument in the sports medicine field. The K-D test is a relatively new instrument based on impaired the evaluation of eye movements, attention, and suboptimal brain functions. The rapid number identification task takes approximately 2 minutes to administer and has a potential advantage as a faster concussion assessment tool on the field; however, to date there have been few investigations looking at its efficacy on different subject populations. This retrospective investigation was conducted to characterize baseline data for the SCAT3 and the K-D tests in terms of concussive history and level of participation, leading into potentially establishing a normative baseline data for the two tests. The study included middle school and high school football players who performed both tests in the pre-season period for baseline concussion testing. Results for the SCAT3 demonstrated a significant difference in past concussion recovery time between different concussive history, and a difference in orientation score, concentration score, length of recovery from previous concussion, Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) delayed recall score, and concussive history when compared between different levels of team. There were no statistically significant differences between any variables on the K-D test. These outcomes suggest that the SCAT3 results differ between different athletes with different concussive history or levels of competition, and suggest invalidity to establish normative data for the SCAT3. Results for the K-D indicate a possibility of establishing normative data, but more control among the administration of the test is needed. The findings do not implicate a correlation between all variables, and further research is needed to apply these findings in a clinical setting and establish efficacy of both tests.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9670], "author_name_tesi": "Yamaguchi, Itsuko ", "last_name_ssi": "Yamaguchi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Itsuko", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William E Buckley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William E Buckley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concussion", "SCAT3", "King-Devick", "baseline data"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Geochemistry of Archean\u2013Paleoproterozoic Black Shales: The Early Evolution of the Atmosphere, Oceans, and Biosphere", "id": "5920", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3671", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-03-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tWhen did the Earth's surface environment become oxic? The timing and mechanism of the rise of atmospheric pO2 level in the early Precambrian have been long debated but no consensus has been reached. The oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans has significant impacts on the evolution of the biosphere and the geochemical cycles of redox-sensitive elements. In order to constrain the evolution of the atmosphere, oceans, biosphere, and geochemical cycles of elements, a systematic and multidisciplinary study of inorganic geochemistry and stable isotope geochemistry was conducted using Archean\u2013 Paleoproterozoic black shales, graywackes, and red shales. \n\tThe samples were collected from unweathered drillcores of the Swaziland Supergroup (3.25 Ga Sheba Formation of Fig Tree Group), the Witwatersrand Supergroup (2.96 Ga Parktown Formation of the West Rand Group), the Ventersdorp Supergroup (2.71 Ga Rietgat Formation  of the Platberg Group), and the Transvaal Supergroup (2.64 Ga Black Reef Formation of the Wolkberg Group, 2.56 Ga Oak Tree Formation of the Chuniespoort Group, 2.22 Ga Timeball Hill Formation of the Pretoria Group, and ~2.2 Ga Mapedi Formation of the Olifantshoek Group) in South Africa and the Mt. Bruce Supergroup (2.72 Ga Pillingini Tuff Formation and 2.69 Ga Jeerinah and Lewin Shale Formations of the Fortescue Group and >2.60 Ga Marra Mamba Iron Formation, 2.60 Ga Wittenoom and Carawine Dolomite Formations of the Hamersley Group) in Australia. \n\tThe above objective was pursued from an array of inter-related studies: (1) the systematics of organic C - pyrite S - ferric Fe - ferrous Fe - P contents and stable isotopes of organic C and pyrite S; (2) the Mo geochemistry; (3) the N isotope geochemistry; and (4) the U-Th geochemistry. For comparison, data from modern sediments and Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks were complied from the literature. Based on these data, the geochemical cycles of C, S, N, Fe, P, Mo, and U in the Archean\u2013Paleoproterozoic surface environments were compared with those of Phanerozoic through modern environments. \n\tFrom (1), I suggest that the contents and stable isotopic compositions of organic C and pyrite S in sediments have been primarily controlled by redox / biological processes in diverse sedimentary redox environments involving oxygenic photosynthesis, aerobic recycling of organic matter, bacterial sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis throughout geologic time. Iron has been oxidized during weathering and reduced during diagenesis, and the P-mediated redox stabilization of the atmosphere and oceans has been operating throughout geologic time. The geochemical cycles of C-S-Fe-P-O would have been essentially the same as today, and they were already in full operation at least 3.25 Ga ago. \n\tFrom (2), based on the kinetics of metal sulfide dissolution, I suggest that Mo-bearing minerals were quantitatively oxidized during weathering and transported to the oceans if the pO2 was higher than 10-6 atm, i.e., >0.0005 % PAL (present atmospheric level). The dissolved Mo was fixed by organic matter and S in locally anoxic environments. The geochemical cycle of Mo during the Archean\u2013Paleoproterozoic time was essentially the same as today.\n\tFrom (3), I suggest that the microbially mediated redox cycling of N involving biological N2-fixation, nitrification, denitrification, and ammonification was already in operation during the Archean, based on the characteristics of the N isotopic compositions of organic-bound N and clay-bound N observed in marine sediments throughout the geologic ages. High Fe content and a positive correlation between Mo and Corg contents of the shales support (although is not an evidence for) the operation of enzymes (FeMo cofactor) responsible for microbial N2-fixation (nitrogenase) and denitrification (dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase-reductase) in the Archean oceans. \n\tFrom (4), I suggest that the continental weathering flux of U in the Archean was probably the same as today because of the enhanced weathering rate of U-bearing silicate minerals (feldspars) under a high pCO2 atmosphere. The weathering of uraninite is considered to be minor in the total continental weathering flux of U. Generally low U contents of the Archean-Paleoproterozoic shales (< 10 ppm) are explained by extensive submarine hydrothermal activity at mid-oceanic ridges as a major sink for the oceanic U and the lack of significant enrichment of organic matter in the shales. The sedimentary enrichment of U by organic matter and the secular increase of the Th/U ratios suggests an importance of the decoupling of U and Th and tectonic recycling of U throughout geologic time. The geochemical cycle of U in the Archean\u2013Paleoproterozoic surface environments was essentially the same as it is today. \n\tThe most important discovery of this study is the early development of the present day redox environments, microbial activity, and geochemical cycles of redox-sensitive elements in the Archean. In the Archean, N2-fixers, photosynthesizers, nitrifyers, denitrifyers, sulfate-reducers, and methane-producing / consuming microorganisms had already formed complex ecosystems, like those of today, in the globally oxic world where the atmosphere and the oceans were oxic with local anoxic environments such as mid-depth O2-minimum zone and anoxic / euxinic basins. This study has implications for the early evolution of an oxic atmosphere, oxic oceans, and complex microbial biosphere not only on the Earth but also on the other Earth-like planets distributed in the universe. Such astrobiological implications expand the possibilities for the discovery of extraterrestrial biosignatures in future space missions. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3651], "author_name_tesi": "Yamaguchi, Kosei ", "last_name_ssi": "Yamaguchi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kosei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Michael Allan Arthur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member", "Hiroshi Ohmoto, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["N2 fixation", "Carbon", "Photosynthesis", "Sulfur", "Sulfate reduction", "Stable Isotopes", "Proterozoic", "Continental Crust", "Black Shales", "Paleoproterozoic", "Anoxic", "Pilbara", "Hamersley", "Iron", "Australia", "Nitrogen", "Archean", "Oxic", "Pyrite", "Thorium", "Nitrification", "Denitrification", "Uranium", "Molybdenum", "Methanogenesis", "Griqualand West", "Witwatersrand", "Barberton", "South Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF THROMBOSIS AT THE BIOMATERIAL SURFACE IN LEFT VENTRICULAR ASSIST SYSTEMS", "id": "6948", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2419", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.

A thrombus may obstruct blood flow, alter fluid dynamics causing damage to blood components, or wash off the surface as emboli and occlude vessels.  \n\nThrombosis at the biomaterial surface in a left ventricular assist system (LVAS) and the effects of implantation time, anticoagulation, fluid mechanics, and biomaterial chemistry were investigated.  LVAS were implanted in calves for 3 and 30 days with and without anticoagulation.

Subjects in each group were randomly assigned to one of four treatment subgroups\u2014Treatment 1 received computer-based instructional text with embedded semantic maps; Treatment 2 received computer-based instructional text with embedded semantic maps and adjunct post-questions; Treatment 3 received computer-based instructional text with embedded semantic maps, adjunct post-questions, and metacognitive process prompts; and Treatment 4 received computer-based instructional text with embedded semantic maps, adjunct post-questions, metacognitive process prompts, and cognitive feedback. Prior to receipt of the computer-based instruction, subjects in Group A were not given strategy training on semantic maps and metacognitive process prompts, but subjects in Group B received one hour of strategy training on semantic maps and, if applicable, one hour of strategy training on metacognitive process prompts. Upon completion of the computer-based instruction, all subjects were given three multiple-choice tests to measure immediate achievement on three different learning outcomes. One week later, all subjects were given the same three multiple-choice tests to measure delayed achievement on the three different learning outcomes.\n\tMultivariate analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in both immediate testing and in delayed testing on the criterion tests' scores among the varied semantic map treatments regardless of whether strategy training was or was not provided. However, a doubly repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the main effect within-factor variable of time was significant.

However, it was thought that if more training was provided that included practice on using the strategies, the results might have favored those who received strategy training. It was also concluded that the combination of empirically and theoretically based strategies does not necessarily enhance learning.

Before a formative test of hypotheses, I conducted three pretests to identify a valid emotion induction method and to develop effective and credible framed messages. Pretest 1 found that the Montreal Affective Voices failed to induce the intended emotions. Results from Pretest 2 indicated that the Life Event Inventory Task successfully induced distinct and robust happiness, anger, and fear. Pretest 3 offered convincing evidence that the framed messages developed for this project were perceived to convey the intended frames and credible information. Using the Life Event Inventory Task and the pretested messages, Study 1 formally tested the hypotheses. First, compared to the valence model, the functional model better accounted for the relationship between emotions and motivational systems (behavioral approach system, BAS, and behavioral inhibition system, BIS). Second, as prescribed by the functional model, I found interactions of emotion and framing to significantly influence attitude. While gain frames produced more favorable attitudes for happy and angry participants, loss frames yielded more favorable attitudes among fearful individuals. I also conducted Study 2 to replicate Study 1, to test a causal model for the emotion-by-framing interaction, and to identify the dominant motivational system under different emotion-by-framing match conditions. Consistent with Study 1, the functional model was again supported. However, only partial support for the emotion-by-framing interaction on intention was found. Structural equation modeling results revealed that emotion and framing had indirect effects on attitude and intention via message related cognition and fear. Additional model comparisons indicated that BAS guided the persuasion process when the approach emotions (anger and happiness) coupled with gain frames; BIS predicted the process when inhibition emotion (fear) fitted with loss frames.

The principal motivation of this thesis is to achieve the ultimate goal of inspecting plates and plate-like structures in aircraft using ultrasonic guided wave phased array techniques to ensure aviation safety. Besides isotropic metallic materials, anisotropic fiber-reinforced composite materials are also included in the thesis as the inspection objects of the phased arrays due to their increasing usage in the aircraft industry.\nOn the basis of the free wave solutions obtained using a semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method, a normal mode expansion technique and a Green\u2019s function based method are employed to investigate the problems of guided wave excitations by various source loadings for both isotropic plates and anisotropic fiber-reinforced composite plates. The derived closed form solutions for guided wave excitations by point sources can be applied to evaluate the guided wave excitations by various transducers. Finite element (FE) models are used to validate the closed form solutions. \nMiscellaneous topics in phased array principles are discussed, including a comparison between beam steering and beam focusing, parametric studies on linear and circular array designs, real-time phased arrays and synthetic phased arrays, a deconvolution method for suppressing phased array image artifacts caused by sidelobes in array directivity profiles, and a back-propagation beamforming technique. To apply the phased array principles to guided wave applications, the influence of unwanted wave modes, guided wave dispersions and the influence of anisotropy in composite plates are identified as the main technical challenges. A concept of a mode selection spectrum is developed and utilized to deal with the influence of unwanted wave modes based on the closed form solutions for guided wave excitations. The guided wave dispersion relations obtained in wave mechanics studies are integrated into the back-propagation beamforming technique. To control the influence of anisotropy, guided wave modes with quasi-isotropic behaviors are selected. Mode 1 in composite plates is found to be suitable for guided wave phased array beam steering at low frequencies. The feasibilities of inspecting plates and plate-like structures using guided wave phased array beam steering are validated by laboratory experiments.\nWave mode selection using phased comb type arrays is another application of the guided wave phased array technique. Based on the guided wave excitation spectrums, the capability of the phased comb type arrays on selecting specific wave modes and frequencies to meet different inspection requirements is explored. A blind discontinuity detection technique is developed for isotropic plates and plate-like structures such that discontinuity detection can still be performed even if the precise isotropic material properties of the objects being inspected are unknown. A novel method of utilizing guided wave skew effects in defect detection for fiber-reinforced composite plates is presented as well. On the basis of skew angle dispersion curves, different wave modes with different skew angles are selected by means of applying different phase delays to the comb array elements to inspect different directions in composite plates. Experimental results are provided as a validation of the proposed techniques.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1996], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Fei ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Maria Lopez De Murphy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nondestructive evaluation", "anisotropic composite plates", "isotropic plates", "beam steering", "phased array", "ultrasonic guided wave", "structural health monitoring"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "NITROGEN REMOVAL IN A SINGLE-CHAMBER MICROBIAL FUEL CELL WITH \nNITRIFYING BIOFILM ENRICHED AT THE AIR CATHODE\n", "id": "11233", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The implementation of nitrogen removal in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is of interest for the treatment of most real waste streams.

The commonly used two-chamber MFC design also suffers from ammonium leaking through the cation exchange membrane (CEM), resulting in moderate ammonia removal.

With pre-enriched nitrifying biofilm, duplicate DEA and Nafion MFCs achieved significantly higher ammonia removal efficiency (up to 96.8 \u00b1 0.2% and 90.7 \u00b1 0.3%, respectively) than a Nafion-control MFC without nitrifier pre-enrichment (54.5% initially due to assimilation and volatilization through the air cathode, and up to 75.1% as a nitrifying biofilm developed). The net production of nitrite and nitrate were measured and the maximum total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiencies were 75.1%, 79.1%, and 93.9% for the Nafion-Control, Nafion, and DEA MFCs, respectively. The nitrifying biofilm MFCs also produced greater maximum power densities, with 945 \u00b1 42 mW/m2 cathode area from Nafion MFCs and 900 \u00b1 25 mW/m2 from DEA MFCs, compared to 750 mW/m2 from the Nafion-control MFC. The polarization experiment hindered the nitrification process in subsequent batches, possibly due to elevated pH at the cathode with high current densities. Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) in nitrifying biofilm MFCs were lower than in the control MFC, probably due to greater oxygen flux at the nitrifying biofilm air cathode. Overall, the use of single-chamber air-cathode MFCs to achieve simultaneous nitrification and denitrification without an investment of aeration energy was successful at the tested ammonia loadings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2366], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Hengjing ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hengjing", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MICROBIAL FUEL CELLS", "NITROGEN REMOVAL", "AMMONIA-OXIDIZING BACTERIA"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigating and employing microbial functions in bioelectrochemical systems for bioenergy production", "id": "18913", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9125", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) rely on microbes serving as the biocatalysts for bioenergy recovery from organic feedstocks, such as wastewater. Microbes can work on both the anode and cathode electrodes for electron transfer, or contribute distinct functions combined with bioelectrochemical systems (BESs). For a better understanding and application of microbial functions in BESs, investigations were conducted on anode community behaviors corresponding to different electrochemical conditions, the potential application of clostridia biocathodes for biofuels production, and combined nutrient treatment in MFCs with a nitrifier-enriched mixed community.\nServing as biocatalysts in anode electron transfer, exoelectrogenic bacteria and their co-colonizers on the anode electrode are subject to various changes in the system operating conditions. Anode potentials in BESs were found to affect both the electrochemical performance and the microbial community structures of the systems. The performance of MFCs under both potentiostatic operation and fixed external resistance has been previously studied. To investigate whether setting anode potentials will result in distinct microbial communities from dynamic anode potentials, fixed anode potentials of -250 mV and -119 mV vs SHE (throughout) were picked to match with the negative peak anode potentials obtained from MFCs operated with a fixed external resistance of 1 k\u03a9 and 47 \u03a9, respectively. Pyrosequence data from two-month time series samples showed hindered enrichment of Geobacter spp. in a more diverse anode bacterial community at the lower fixed anode potential (-250 mV) compared to 1 k\u03a9, though more comparable Geobacter abundances in anode biofilms were found between the -119 mV and 47 \u03a9 reactors. Setting the anode potential at the negative peak values results in less energy extraction by the microorganisms for growth, which might have slowed down the development of the whole anode microbial community as well as the enrichment of exoelectrogenic bacteria. In addition, a possible limitation of potentiostatic operation with a volumetric anode is uncertainty in the actual anode potential due to variable proximity to the reference electrode. This study indicated that a balance between screening exoelectrogenic bacteria and encouraging microbial growth needs to be considered when setting a low anode potential in BESs.\nExoelectrotrophic bacteria contribute to cathode electron transfer and are helpful in converting electrical energy to other useful energy carriers or products. Altered electron flow has previously been induced in Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation using electrochemical energy as a source of reducing equivalents in the presence of the electron mediator methyl viologen. Also, C. acetobutylicum was demonstrated to produce exclusively hydrogen using cathode-derived electrons under organic-free conditions in the presence of methyl viologen.  Recently, C. acetobutylicum was demonstrated to generate current in MFC anodes without the addition of redox mediators. The study here was aimed at testing the possibility of using electrical energy without exogenous mediator addition to influence the distribution of valuable extracellular products, such as hydrogen, butanol, and ethanol, using C. acetobutylicum as the cathode biocatalyst. C. acetobutylicum was demonstrated to be exoelectrotrophic with a fixed cathode potential at -400 mV and organic carbon sources. A current uptake of up to 83 mA/m2 was achieved by C. acetobutylicum, with a decreasing trend over time that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed was probably due to an increased cathode charge transfer resistance. Control experiments and cyclic voltammetry tests ruled out abiotic electrochemical hydrogen evolution and electron shuttles for electron transfer, suggesting that the cells derived electrons directly from the electrode. Increased yields of more energy dense products (hydrogen and butanol) and decreased yields of butyrate, acetate, and ethanol were found with current uptake by C. acetobutylicum. The electron balance indicated that current uptake might have also reduced the biomass production of C. acetobutylicum. This study demonstrated the non-mediated exoelectrotrophic phenotype of a solventogenic bacterium. The metabolic flux shift with current uptake found in this study provides a primary guidance for the potential utilization of a C. acetobutylicum biocathode in a BES.\nSingle-chamber MFCs with nitrifiers pre-enriched at the air cathodes have previously been demonstrated as a passive strategy for integrating nitrogen removal into current-generating BESs. To further define system design parameters for this strategy, the effects of oxygen diffusion area and COD/N ratio in continuous-flow reactors were investigated. Doubling the gas diffusion area by adding an additional air cathode or a diffusion cloth significantly increased the ammonia and COD removal rates (by up to 115% and 39%), ammonia removal efficiency (by up to 134%), the cell voltage and cathode potentials, and the power densities (by up to 124%). When the COD/N ratio was lowered from 13 to 3, up to 244% higher ammonia removal rate but at least 19% lower ammonia removal efficiency were detected.  An increase of COD removal rate by up to 27% was also found when the COD/N ratio was lowered from 11 to 3.  The Coulombic efficiency (CE) was not affected by the additional air cathode, but decreased an average of 11% with the addition of a diffusion cloth.  Ammonia removal by assimilation was also estimated to understand the ammonia removal mechanism in these systems. These results show that the doubling of gas diffusion area enhanced N and COD removal rates without compromising electrochemical performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8950], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Hengjing ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hengjing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan", "John Michael Regan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "William D Burgos", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Dissertation Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Committee Chair", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bioelectrochemical systems", "anode potentials", "microbial community", "Clostridium acetobutylicum", "metabolic flux", "nitrogen removal"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Energy Consumption Analyses of Frequently-used HVAC System Types in High Performance Office Buildings", "id": "21815", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The high energy consumption of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings is a hot topic. Office buildings, a typical building set of commercial buildings, have also drawn enormous attention from researchers, facility managers, designers and building owners due to high HVAC energy consumptions. Office buildings have a set of frequently-used HVAC systems. These HVAC systems might have different energy consumption patterns. High performance office buildings narrow the scope of testing this hypothesis. Thus, the main objective of this thesis is to identify the frequently-used HVAC system types for high performance office buildings and enable them in the energy consumption analyses. \nAs a good representative of high performance buildings, a group of 134 LEED NC (Leadership in Energy Efficient Design for New Construction & Major Renovations) certified office buildings provide important resources to explore the frequently-used HVAC system types in high performance office buildings. Frequently-used proposed HVAC systems are defined by their frequencies in this valuable building sample. \nThe energy consumption analyses will go through each frequently-used proposed HVAC system type. The energy consumption analyses explore (1) the energy consumption characteristics focusing on proposed design cases and (2) energy saving characteristics from baseline to proposed cases. Also from these 134 LEED certified office buildings, three clusters of low, medium, and high energy use intensity have been identified as integrating both the building size characteristics and total energy consumption patterns. Clusters classification provides a further approach to compare the energy consumption patterns.\nAn actual large size office building in Philadelphia is selected as the case study to demonstrate an energy consumption pattern. The well calibrated building model offers an ideal opportunity to test the energy consumption difference if it is changed to another HVAC system type. Further simulations of lighting load reduction and envelop system upgrade are also possible. These energy consumption patterns in high performance buildings pointed out not only the key areas that affect the energy consumption characteristics but also the directions that lead to potential energy savings for retrofit in low performance office buildings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9398], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Liusheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liusheng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jenela Srebric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jenela Srebric, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["High performance office buildings", "LEED", "Energy consumption characteristics", "Energy saving characteristics", "Proposed HVAC system"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Experimental Investigation of Shale Gas Production Impairment Due to Fracturing Fluid Migration During Shut-in Time", "id": "19314", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydraulic fracturing has been applied to exploit shale reservoirs with permeability less than 1mD for more than sixty years. During the fracturing process, large amount of pressurized fracturing fluid is injected to create and propagate the fracture, with the drawback that fracturing fluid recovery can be very low, even less than 10%.  Moreover, this fracturing fluid can enter the formation and block the rock pores, thus reducing the effective permeability to gas and causing gas production impairment. This flow hindrance caused by fracturing fluid invasion is called \u2018fracture-face damage\u2019 and it is believed to aggravate during shut-in time. Therefore, the objective of this investigation is to quantify gas production impairment due to spontaneous migration of fracturing fluid into shale formations, as a function of shut-in time. Core flooding experiments were designed to mimic initial leak-off volume, followed by shut-in time and flowback. Results are presented in terms of regained permeability ratios as a function of shut-in time. Findings from this work show that regained permeability in shale decreases with shut-in time, as the fluid front propagates within the rock. Findings are also compared against previous experiments using tight sand cores, which show a favorable effect of shut-in time on regained permeability. From this comparison, it was found that lithology plays a determining role on the relationship between shut-in time and regained permeability. The level of impairment caused by fracturing fluid migration was found to be significantly higher in shale cores than tight sands, which is attributed to the inherent low permeability of shale formations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9086], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Qiyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiyan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H", "Zuleima T Karpyn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fracturing fluid", "permeability", "shut-in time", "leak-off", "low-permeability formations"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Cost-effective Intervention - Innovative Strategies for Public Health Care", "id": "21371", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8538", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Limits on health care resources mandate that decision makers design intervention strategies that are cost-effective. In this dissertation, three cost-effective models are developed and applied to address three different health care problems.\nThe first problem is concerned with the evaluation of children\u2019s dental care practices using longitudinal claims data. By linking service mix to the stage of care and applying a Markov chain approach, we examine the feasibility of using recurring patterns of care to evaluate how well patients are integrated into the dental system. The results suggest that privately-insured children are better integrated into dental care than Medicaid-insured children. In addition, transition probabilities estimated from longitudinal claims data provide insight on the quality of a dental program. The model enables practitioners to institute changes in the pattern of delivery, to identify problem areas, and to determine if proposed changes should take place. It also provides a mechanism to estimate the level of government funding needed to support a service goal. We illustrate this by applying the model to estimate the financial cost of implementing a component of the Affordable Care Act for the oral health of children.\nThe second problem deals with the development of appropriate intervention strategies for Tuberculosis transmission in health care settings. The risk of occupational infection by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis among patients and health care workers has received increased attention.  An infection risk model based on biological and physical principles was developed by taking into consideration primary intervention measures. The simulation results show that HIV+ patients should be isolated during admission into the hospital, and that a higher screening frequency for health care workers will significantly reduce the infection cases among patients and health care workers. A distributive model with space segmentation was also studied which suggests that susceptible patients sitting closer to the infectious sources will have a greater risk of being infected. The study will help hospitals in designing their personalized cost-effective intervention strategy based on their specific situation. \nThe third problem examines the impact of food deserts on obesity as well as interventions to reduce their significance. We focused on finding the association of food retailers and obesity in US adults. A nonlinear parametric regression was developed using publicly available data at the county level. The model suggests that, in metropolitan areas, obesity rate is positively associated with supercenters and convenience stores and negatively associated with grocery stores and specialty food stores. In non-metropolitan areas, obesity rate is positively associated with supercenters and negatively associated with specialty food stores. We estimated the marginal effect on obesity from the addition of a new food retailer type in a geographic region. This will be useful in identifying regions where interventions based on food retailer type would be most effective. We illustrate several possible applications of the model including: an incentive contract that will elicit a desired level of operator's effort while maximizing the foundation's utility, a proper division of the total subsidies into loans and grants, and a strategic design of food store establishment plan by local government.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8427], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Renfei ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Renfei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Griffin", "Paul Griffin", "Harriet Black Nembhard", "Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Douglas J Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Griffin, Committee Chair", "Harriet Black Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cost-Effective Modeling", "Public Health Intervention", "Dental Care", "Tuberculosis Transimission", "Food Environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL IMPACT DYNAMICS TESTING OF A GLACIATED WATER DROP AND QUANTIFICATION OF PARTIAL MELTING WITH VARYING RESIDENCE TIME", "id": "d504rk32w", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12112", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High altitude ice crystals have been recently discovered to be the cause of engine and heated probe icing over high humidity tropical regions. Ice accretion related to partially melted ice crystals was first discovered in 2006 and it is a threat to aviation safety. It is known that ice crystals without any water content do not accrete to surfaces. The classical frame icing theory involving super-cooled water droplets cannot explain the cause of icing inside turbofan engines flying at altitudes where there is no water content, since only fully glaciated ice crystal clouds exist. To understand the icing conditions and physical mechanism of engine icing, research projects like the High Altitude Ice Crystal (HAIC) international project are been conducted, and test facilities, like the National Research Council icing wind tunnel or the NASA Propulsion System Laboratory tunnel, have been constructed. The correlation between engine icing events and mixed-phase icing clouds that partially melt when ingested in an engine has been confirmed in these facilities. Despite the availability of facilities to reproduce the ice accretion events inside engines, fundamental testing of individual partially melted water droplets is not available and the validation of tools to predict partial melting of crystals is not possible. The study of physical processes involved in the partial melting of a single ice crystal can be divided into two parts. The first part is the impact dynamics of the single droplet, and the second part is the melting process of the frozen droplet. Attempts to characterize these two phenomena were conducted at the Adverse Environmental Rotor Test Stand Facility at Penn State. To quantify impact dynamics of ice crystals, high-speed video of single frozen water droplets impacting a surface was acquired. The frozen particles had a diameter ranging from 0.4 mm to 0.9 mm and impacted at velocities varying from 90 m/sec to 309 m/sec. The technique used to freeze the droplets and launch the particles against a surface is described. High-speed video was used to quantify the ice accretion area to the surface for varying impact angles (30\u2070, 45\u2070, 60\u2070), and impacting velocities. An oxygen /acetylene cross-flow flame was used to partially melt the traveling frozen particles and it is also discussed. A linear relationship between impact angle and ice accretion is identified for fully frozen particles. The slope of the relationship is affected by impact speed. Higher impact angles closer to perpendicularity between the surface and the particle trajectory, e.g. 60\u2070, exhibited small differences in ice accretion with varying velocities. Increasing velocity from 161 m/sec to 259 m/sec nearly doubled the ice accretion area at a shallower impact angle of 30\u2070. The increase accretion area highlights the importance of impact angle and velocity on the accretion process of partially melted ice crystals. It was experimentally observed that partial melting was not a pre-requisite for accretion at the tested velocities when impact angles of 45\u2070 and 30\u2070 were used. The ice accretion due to impact was observed under five surface temperatures, -20\u00b0C, -15\u00b0C, -10\u00b0C, 0\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C. The influence of the surface temperature was qualitatively observed at an impact angle of 30\u00b0. The temperature varied from -15\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C, and a maximum area of ice accretion was observed at surface temperatures surrounding the freezing point of water. \nA second emphasis of the work was to correlate residence time requirements for the melting of frozen drops. To characterize the melting process of fully glaciated droplets, a luminescent technique was developed to measure the percentage of melting experimentally. Luminescent dye and high-speed camera visualization were used to monitor the partial melting state of an ultrasonically levitated frozen drop exposed to warm environments. Rhodamine B was dissolved (0.01% mass fraction) in the water used to create a droplet. The Droplet was placed at the node of the wave created by the acoustic levitator and frozen via convective cooling. When the cold air flow was turned off, the partial melting of the droplet began. Water droplets with a diameter ranging approximately between 300\u00b5m to 1800\u00b5m were tested. Four environmental melting temperatures were tested: 5\u00b0C, 15\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C. The variation of percentage of partial melting of the drop with time was recorded. The correlation between the rate of melting, environmental temperature, and diameter of the frozen droplets is reported and discussed. It is confirmed that the time rate of melting is inversely proportional to the diameter of the ice crystals and directly proportional to the environmental temperature. An empirical fit to predict the percentage of partial melting with respect to temperature and droplet diameter was experimentally acquired. The models developed in this research can improve the understanding of the physics related to engine icing. In addition, several technologies developed during the effort can be applied to icing wind tunnel testing for the quantification of partial melting.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12701], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Sihong ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sihong", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Engine Icing", "Mixed-phase Ice Crystals", "Impact", "Luminescense", "Melting Process"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "SEMI-SUPERVISED CLUSTERING FOR HIGH-DIMENSIONAL\nAND SPARSE FEATURES", "id": "11038", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6039", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clustering is one of the most common data mining tasks, used frequently for data organization and analysis in various application domains. Traditional machine learning approaches to clustering are fully automated and unsupervised where class labels are unknown a priori. In real application domains, however, some ``weak\" form of side information about the domain or data sets can be often available or derivable. In particular, information in the form of instance-level pairwise constraints is general and is relatively easy to derive. The problem with traditional clustering techniques is that they cannot benefit from side information even when available. I study the problem of semi-supervised clustering, which aims to partition a set of unlabeled data items into coherent groups given a collection of constraints. Because semi-supervised clustering promises higher quality with little extra human effort, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice.\n\n\nSemi-supervised clustering shares a difficulty with a large number of other learning methods in data mining literature. That is, they lose their algorithmic effectiveness for high dimensional data. I focus on data with high-dimensional sparse features and present a series of novel semi-supervised clustering approaches that are both effective and efficient in learning from high-dimensional data. The proposed approaches are based on the dimensionality reduction idea. High-dimensional input data are embedded into an optimal low-dimensional subspace determined with the help of side information. The clustering structure of data is more evident in the subspace than in the original input space, and thus enable higher quality clustering solutions. The proposed clustering approaches explore both a small set of constraints and the large amount of unlabeled data, thus perform robustly even with limited side information. Besides, I also study how to automatically generate constraints based on domain knowledge. Since automatically generated constraints are inevitably noisy, I propose a semi-supervised approach that is able to use noisy side information to improve clustering accuracy. Moreover, the non-linear separability problem is studied in the semi-supervised clustering setting. I propose a solution that is computationally as easy as a linear-transformation based method, but is still able to separate non-linear data effectively.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6031], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Su ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Su", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee", "Dongwon Lee", "C Lee Giles", "Jesse Louis Barlow", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Chair", "C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dimension reduction", "clustering", "semi-supervised learning", "document analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Surface Plasmon-Based Manipulation of Microparticles and Dynamics Study\n\n\n\n", "id": "8702", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6629", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The manipulation of micrometer or nanometer scale objects based on light-matter interaction has been a hot topic ever since Ashkin proposed in 1986 the \u00a1\u00b0optical tweezers\u00a1\u00b1, which realized optical trapping and manipulation of polystyrene latex micro-particles through focused laser beams.

The effects of viscosity changes in the lubricant with temperature are taken into account. The performance of the slider bearing system can be determined by reference to three dimensionless design parameters: length-to-width ratio (B/L), bearing load parameter (w_th) and the pivot location (X_C) of the bearing pad. \nThe relationships between the performance variables and the design parameters are analyzed. The analysis suggests that centrally pivoted bearings can develop significant hydrodynamic lubrication load capacity when the bearing pad is sufficiently wide such as a length-to-width ratio (B/L) of 1 or less. The results show that the load capacity is reduced as the bearing pad narrows and the reduction becomes steep for bearings of B/L>1. At B/L=2, the reduction has become pronounced and the load capacity of the bearing is diminished. In addition, the analysis reveals that the lubricant film thickness in the bearing is relatively insensitive to the applied load when the bearing pad is sufficiently wide such as B/L<1. As the bearing pad narrows, however, the film thickness becomes increasingly sensitive and the sensitivity becomes large at B/L=2, making it very difficult to design centrally pivoted narrow bearings.\nThe model is then used to study off-centrally pivoted bearings, and design charts are given for such bearings. The relationships between film thickness, friction coefficient, and pivot location are studied under various combinations of load parameters and length-to-width ratios.\nThe results obtained from the model are compared to numerical results in the published literature. The validity and accuracy of the model may be evaluated by numerical analysis and by performing experiments on actual slider bearings in future work.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6939], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Yan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Liming Chang", "Liming Chang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Liming Chang, Thesis Advisor", "Liming Chang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal", "hydrodynamic lubrication", "pivoted slider bearing"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Sub-wavelength Modulation of Complex Refractive Index and X\u001f(2) Optical Nonlinearity in Organic Thin Films", "id": "13636yvy5071", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13636", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The spatial modulations of complex refractive index and optical nonlinearity are the essence to many functional components ranging from distributed feedback, photonic crystals, gain coupled lasers, long distance high efficiency second harmonic generation, etc. in today\u2019s optical and optoelectronic technologies. In particular, the possibility to separately modulate the real and imaginary parts of the refractive\nindices have sparked intense theoretical interests because it enables the optical analogue of parity-time symmetry, a concept originated from quantum field theory. Such complex refractive index modulation (CIM) also leads to various intriguing optical phenomena such as unidirectional invisibility, coherent perfect absorption,and power oscillations. Beyond the regime of linear optics, modulating the second order nonlinear optical susceptibility \u001fX(2) of materials at the nanoscale represents an ongoing technological challenge that is important for a variety of nonlinear nanophotonic applications, such as mirrorless optical parametric generation.\nHere, we exploit vapor-deposited organic small molecules to realize arbitrary CIM and demonstrate passive PT-symmetry breaking in a composite organic thin film. The co-evaporation of three different organic materials a non-absorbing high index host, a non-absorbing low index dopant, and an absorbing dopant form the basis of individual layers, and the multiple CIM unit repeat units are designed for optical structures with n(r) = n*\u0003(\u2212r) at \u0015 = 532 nm. So that this condition of the real (n) and imaginary (k) components of the refractive index as even and odd functions of position, r, satisfies the PT symmetry requirements. Based on\nthese composite small molecular organic thin films, we demonstrate unidirectional reflectivity at PT symmetry breaking point, open up opportunities for organic materials as a platform to explore PT symmetry in optics and more generally as a means to create optical alloys with arbitrary complex refractive index modulation.\nGoing beyond the realm of linear optical systems, we exploit the large hyperpolarizability of intermolecular charge transfer (CT) states, naturally aligned at an organic semiconductor donor-acceptor (DA) interface, as a means to control the magnitude and sign of \u001fX(2) at the nanoscale. Focusing initially on a single pentacene-C60 DA interface, we confirm that the CT transition is strongly aligned orthogonal to the heterojunction and find that it is responsible for a large interfacial nonlinearity probed via second harmonic generation that is sufficient to achieve d33 > 10 pm/V when incorporated in a non-centrosymmetric DA multilayer stack.\nUsing grating-shadowed oblique angle deposition to laterally structure the DA interface distribution in such multilayers subsequently enables the demonstration of a \u001fX(2) grating with 280 nm periodicity, which is the shortest reported to date.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13750], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Yixin ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yixin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Noel C.

Though numerous chiral ligands have been developed for asymmetric hydroformylation, few of them can afford enantioselectivities of over 90% ee. To address these challenges, a new hybrid phosphine-phosphoramidite ligand, namely YanPhos, has been developed. The ligand has been investigated in the rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation of styrene derivatives, vinyl carboxylates and cyclic internal olefins. To the best of our knowledge, YanPhos provides the highest enantioselectivities ever reported in the asymmetric hydroformylations of styrene derivatives (up to 99 % ee) and vinyl carboxylates (up to 98 % ee). \n  Since linear aldehydes are very important raw materials for the polymer and detergent industries, highly regioselective hydroformylation catalysts are highly desirable. From the economic point of view, regioselective catalysts for the hydroformylation of internal olefins are very important. However, the regioselectivities achieved with current ligands are far from satisfactory. We have developed a new concept in designing ligands for regioselective hydroformylation: tetraphosphorous ligands with enhanced chelating ability through multiple chelating modes and increased local phosphorus concentration can provide higher regioselectivity than their corresponding bisphosphorus ligands. Based on this concept, two tetraphosphorus ligands have been designed, synthesized and successfully applied in highly regioselective hydroformylations. To the best of our knowledge, tetraphosphoramidite ligand provides the highest regioselectivity ever reported in the homogenous isomerization-hydroformylation of internal olefins. Tetraphosphine ligand exhibits remarkable improved high temperature performance in the hydroformylation of terminal olefins.   \n  Though many efficient chiral ligands have been developed for asymmetric hydrogenation, there is no universal ligand which can hydrogenate all prochiral substrates with high enantioselectivity. To expand the substrate scope, the development of new chiral ligands with novel structural motifs is highly desirable. Further more, efficient chiral ligands made from inexpensive readily available starting material are of significant importance for large scale industrial applications. Thus, an efficient chiral bis(azaphosphorinane) ligand has been developed. This ligand can be synthesized from inexpensive chiral epoxide and provides comparable or even better enantioselectivities than DuPhos in the rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations of beta-dehydroamino acid derivatives and aryl enamides (up to > 99 % ee for both types of substrates). Two hybrid phosphorus ligands have also been developed. These hybrid ligands bearing binaphthyl backbone with ortho phenyl substituents provide excellent enantioselectivities in the rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of alpha-dehydroamino acid derivatives (up to >99 % ee).\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6936], "author_name_tesi": "Yan, Yongjun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yongjun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Xumu Zhang", "Scott Trent Feldman", "Qing Wang", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Xumu Zhang, Committee Chair", "Scott Trent Feldman, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhodium", "Hydroformylation", "Hydrogenation", "Phosphorus Ligand", "Catalyst"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Exploring Power Reliability Tradeoffs in On-Chip Networks", "id": "11155", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The past decade has seen a shift in the arms race of the microprocessor industry from increasing the clock frequency to increasing the number of cores on chip. Power and performance considerations have motivated the adoption of chip multiprocessors (CMPs). As a result, there is an emphasis on the performance of the on-chip interconnection network that connect these cores. Bus based designs dominated the interconnection network in the industry so far. They are early indications of buses being replaced with a packet based Network-on-Chip (NoC) due to the scalability issues of on-chip buses.\nReliability concerns such as soft errors, process variation and premature transistor failure threaten future technology scaling. NoCs are beset by the same challenges as well. The distributed nature of the NoC provides for a different approach for solving these issues. In this dissertation, we address several phenomena that cause errors in the Network on Chip domain. We also address the reliability impact of several techniques proposed in the literature to improve the performance and power of the NoC.\nNoC power consumption has been identified as a chief limiter to adoption in the industry. Providing reliability costs area and power on the chip. For example, error correction codes (ECC) are employed to mitigate the effect of soft errors on NoC. Such power requirements place an additional burden on the chip designers. In this dissertation, we propose techniques to reduce the power required to maintain iso-reliable systems. Reducing the power required to maintain reliable NoCs is an important factor in achieving the goal of highly reliable low-power NoCs. Techniques proposed in this dissertation aim to achieve such a system.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [377], "author_name_tesi": "Yanamandra, Aditya ", "last_name_ssi": "Yanamandra", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aditya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Jane Irwin", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Padma Raghavan", "Vittaldas V Prabhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Jane Irwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electromigration", "Soft Errors", "Reliability", "Network on chip", "Router Cache", "Iso-reliable"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DISTRIBUTION AND DIVERSITY OF SULFUR-REDUCING PROKARYOTES\nIN SULFUR-RICH PEAT SOILS\n\n", "id": "7285", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "981", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Geochemical transfers between the Lockport Dolomite Formation and overlying wetlands near the town of Manning in Western New York have resulted in peat soils that contain high levels of sulfur, zinc, and cadmium. These peat soils are artificially drained for agricultural purposes and they have undergone drastic seasonal changes in redox for the last 60 years. Sulfur cycle reactions driven by prokaryotes potentially influence the availability, mobility and the biogeochemical control of Zn and Cd retention in the peats. The objectives of this research were to determine the presence of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRP), to detect enzymatic pathways used for sulfur respiration, to evaluate the influence of temporal and spatial changes in sulfate-reducing populations and to determine the oxidation states of S present in peat soils from the Manning region. \nSurface peat samples were collected from the Manning peatland region of Western New York in July 2002 (dry season). The surface soils were collected from the edge of a field, along a Zn phytotoxicity gradient starting in an area where there was no plant growth and moving to a zone of typical plant growth. Additionally, intact soil vertical profiles (soil cores) were collected during dry (July 2002) and wet (March 2004) seasons. The soil cores were collected along a lateral transect where the center of the field had high enough levels of Zn (phytotoxic levels) to prevent plant growth and moving to areas of stunted, and then typical plant growth.\nThe diversity of prokaryotes involved in sulfur reduction was studied in peat soils containing high natural levels of sulfur (4,200 to 40,500 mg kg-1), zinc (137.5 to 71175 mg kg-1) and cadmium (<1 to 310.7 mg kg-1). Diversity in microbial populations was analyzed using classical and molecular approaches and the microbiological data were coupled to the spectroscopic characterization (S-XANES) of the oxidation states of sulfur in the peats under investigation. Sulfur-XANES analyses reveal that sulfide/thiol groups (reduced forms of S) and sulfonate groups (oxidized forms of S) are the two dominant S species in surface peats. While the percentage of the total S present in oxidized forms is relatively constant (~10%) in vertical profiles, about 40% and 60% of the total S exist as sulfide/thiol groups (reduced forms of S) in surface and deep soils, respectively. The use of ribosomal intergenic spacer analyses (RISA) for the characterization of bacterial communities revealed the abundance and diversity of microorganisms. Dominant bacterial populations inhabiting surface soils were very similar, while those located in deep soils were dynamic, responding to changes induced by depth and season. Enumerations of sulfate-reducing prokaryotes (SRPs) in surface soils indicated that SRPs using acetate or lactate as electron donors represent only a small fraction (~103 g-1 dry soil) of total cell densities determined by microscopy (~109 g-1 dry soil). Enrichment for SRPs showed that typical sulfate reducing bacteria (delta subgroup of Proteobacteria, among others) do not seem to be present in surface soils although 40% of the total S is in reduced (thiol/sulfide) forms. Instead, sulfur cycling in these metalliferous surface soils is driven by Gram-positive bacteria related to Clostridium spp. and may involve the use of sulfonates as electron acceptors. Results of PCR-amplification of enzymes involved in the sulfur respiration pathway [adenosine-5\u2019-phosphosulfate reductase (apsA) and dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrAB)] in DNA from surface soils supported these observations. No dsrAB genes were detected and phylogenetic association of cloned sequences showed that apsA sequences recovered from these soils had diverged from apsA of known SRPs. Alternative pathways for sulfur dissimilation are proposed for these surface soils. The enzyme anaerobic sulfite reductase (asrA) was detected in the peats and phylogenetic analysis of asrA sequences revealed a wide distribution and diversity of this gene.\nBy analysis of dsrAB genes in deep peat soils, we identified sulfate-reducing prokaryotes in soil profile samples deeper than 45 cm. Furthermore, the sequences of dsrAB genes present in peat soil samples from both dry and wet seasons have not been previously described in the literature. Thus, our results suggest that novel sulfur-reducing prokaryotes are present in these peat soils and that they might be specialized colonists in these metalliferous soil environments.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [972], "author_name_tesi": "Yanez Prieto, Carolina Elvira Maria ", "last_name_ssi": "Yanez Prieto", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Carolina Elvira Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Mart\u00ednez", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Peter Landschoot", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carmen Enid Mart\u00ednez, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Peter Landschoot, Committee Member", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Peat soils", "sulfur cycle", "sulfate-reducing bacteria", "heavy metals"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "On Literature and the Secret Art of (Im)possible Worlds: Teaching Literature-Through-Language\n\n", "id": "8902", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An increasing amount of Applied Linguistics research calls for the integration of language and literature in foreign language education in reaction to the typical separation of these two disciplines in the traditional curriculum. The present classroom-based empirical study illustrates through the description of a literature-through-language course for third-year students of Spanish how literature and language can be organically integrated in foreign language education. The proposed pedagogy suggests the creation of a problem in the literary text that students have to solve by rewriting, reconstructing or transforming the work through mediating tools in the form of linguistic concepts. This study also examines the impact of literature-through-language instruction on students\u2019 discourse proficiency, as well as their attitudes towards language, language learning, and literature. Data was obtained from students\u2019 portfolios, compositions, and interviews. The method of data analysis was historical or genetic. The analysis shows how traditional empirical rules initially hampered students\u2019 creativity and their understanding of how (literary) texts evoke meaning in implicit ways. In contrast, as the literature-through-language course progressed, students\u2019 written production and reflections revealed their increasing efforts to compose meaning through lexicogrammatical and textual choices (rather than explicitly in the propositional content) in their compositions as a result of the recontextualization of conceptual knowledge appropriated in reconstructing activities with literary texts. Finally, learners\u2019 comments seem to indicate a reconceptualization of language as a creative tool for personal meaning rather than as a set of constraining rules.
