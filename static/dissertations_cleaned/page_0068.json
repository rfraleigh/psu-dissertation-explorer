To achieve its research purpose, the study utilized \u201cNational Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS Refresher)\u201d data collected from 862 aged workers in the United States from 2011-2014. The analysis procedure was as follows: (a) validity and reliability analysis of measurements, (b) descriptive analysis, (c) correlation analysis, and (d) moderated multiple regression analysis. The results of the multiple regression analysis show that skill discretion, self-esteem, optimism, and active coping had positive effects on psychological well-being, while chronic job discrimination had a negative effect on psychological well-being. Co-worker support, supervisor support, job demands, and decision-making authority were not significant. Among the interaction terms, the moderating effect between optimism and chronic job discrimination was significant.

Faults are traditionally considered to accommodate this strain by either constant slow movement (creep), or by rapid catastrophic failure events (earthquakes). The behavior of faults which produce earthquakes has been extensively studied, including characterization of the time and slip predictability of earthquakes, frequency-magnitude distributions, aftershock decay patterns, dynamic triggering, and frictional processes. Chance observations in global positioning system (GPS) data from the Vancouver Island area in 2001 revealed a new kind of fault slip that had not been considered before, slow-slip events. Since those early observations, slow-slip events have been observed at most major subduction interfaces and even in glacial systems. \n\nIn this dissertation, I strive to answer some of the fundamental questions about slow-slip systems. Little is known about the dynamics of these systems and how they operate. Scattered laboratory observations have provided clues, but this study is the first systematic examination of slow-slip earthquakes and their frictional behavior in the laboratory. I examine questions such as what controls how a fault zone will fail and what the velocity and normal stress sensitives are, then connect those mechanisms to observations from a natural slow-slip system beneath Whillans Ice Stream in western Antarctica.\n\nIn chapter 1, I demonstrate how to modify the stiffness of the testing machine to create slow-slip events in the laboratory in an artificial granular material. I also present a method to automatically calculate the stiffness of each slip event in a given experiment. Chapter 2 extends this work into a synthetic fault gouge material and carefully examines the sensitivity of the system to the stiffness of the testing apparatus. Chapter 3 introduces the new parameter of velocity dependence into the test suite and demonstrates that designer frictional laws (those whose velocity dependence of friction is itself velocity dependent) are not necessary to explain observations of slow-slip. Chapter 4 introduces the field area of Whillans Ice Stream, a system that hosts slow-slip events daily at an ice-till interface approximately 1 km below the ice surface. I test samples of the till obtained by piston coring of the ice stream in 1989 and develop a simple hydrologic model to determine the potential stress states of the system and an effective medium model to predict the acoustic velocities under those stresses. The entire system is then examined in the light of stability theory to postulate why it has been able to remain in the slow-slip regime for as long as it has been observed. Finally, in chapter 5 I examine the generation of electrical potential differences on slipping experimental faults and critically evaluate the generation mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n\nThis dissertation provides insight into the mechanisms and controls of fault slip. I demonstrate that fault failure is not a bifurcation between stable and unstable, but rather a continuous spectrum of failure modes from slow to fast stick-slip. The evidence provided shows that the stiffness of the system is the dominant controlling mechanism and that higher order frictional terms are not required to explain the basic spectrum of behaviors observed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14384], "author_name_tesi": "Leeman, John Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Leeman", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Marone", "Demian Saffer", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Richard Alley", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Marone, Dissertation Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Committee Chair", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Richard Alley, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["slow slip", "earthquake", "fault mechanics", "rock mechanics", "fault stability", "ice stream"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The tectonic and thermal evolution of Hawke's Bay Basin, New Zealand\n\n\n", "id": "10805", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4179", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As part of an active plate boundary throughout the Neogene, the thermal evolution of the East Coast Basin along the Hikurangi margin reflects the transition from tectonic extension to convergence.  Combining the stratigraphic (burial/exhumation) history of the region as recorded in the Oputouma-1 well with Apatite Fission Track (AFT) ages and track length distributions, and vitrinite reflection (Ro) results from well samples, I have assessed the tectonic framework of the basin incorporating improved models of plate motions, and the thermal effects of plate boundary evolution (e.g. heat flow effects of extension, subduction emplacement, thrusting).  We have used a time-dependent numerical (finite-difference) thermal modeling approach that explicitly includes effects of crustal heat production distributions, variable thermal properties of different lithologies, burial and exhumation, regional extension prior to 30 Ma, and the effects of subduction emplacement and ongoing subduction from 25 Ma - present.  The vertical section comprised of well samples extending more than 3.5 km below the surface provides substantial constraints on the range of viable tectonic and thermal histories for the basin.\nModel results indicate the following: (1) Once subduction begins beneath the Hawke\u2019s Bay region, AFT ages and Ro values are locked-in. Modeling results place the timing of the start of subduction at ~ 25 Ma.  (2) The level of organic maturation indicated by the Ro values in conjunction with AFT ages and track lengths requires a relatively high heat flow regime during the Eocene-Oligocene, consistent with the plate tectonic history of the region that implies that New Zealand was undergoing extension during that time.  (3) Although there is stratigraphic evidence of Miocene burial and exhumation, little additional thermal maturation occurred during this time.  Our thermal models indicate that most organic maturation and hydrocarbon production would occur prior to the ca. 25 Ma initiation of subduction, raising the question of whether appropriate reservoir structures and seals existed at that time.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4154], "author_name_tesi": "Legg, Matthew James", "last_name_ssi": "Legg", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Kevin Patrick Furlong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Patrick Furlong, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tectonics", "petroleum exploration", "hydrocarbon maturation", "apatite fission track"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CAREGIVER STRESS, BURDEN, AND ASSOCIATED DIFFICULTIES \nAS A RESULT OF LEWY BODY DEMENTIA\n\n", "id": "10467", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "316", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "People with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) present a unique set of symptoms and challenges to family caregivers compared to other types of dementia.

Though depression has been found to be less common among older adults than younger age groups, there are certain stressful contexts where rates of depression are very high.  This dissertation examines two stressful, social contexts: caregiving for a relative with dementia and the transition process to long-term care residency.  A biopsychosocial approach is taken to examine biological, psychological, and social risk and protective factors that may be associated with depressive mood in these stressful contexts.  Multi-level modeling is utilized to examine these risk and protective factors in association with depressive mood across time.  \nIn Study 1, 175 older adults who transitioned from home to long-term care residency were studied across five measurement waves each spaced three years apart.  Personal control variables, mastery and self-efficacy, which have previously been identified as protective factors for depression, were examined as covariates across the time-to/from transition continuum.  Depressive symptoms increased linearly across the transition and the transition and adjustment periods showed significant between person differences suggesting heterogeneity following the transition.  Mastery and self-efficacy significantly covaried with depressive mood across the waves such that an increase in control was associated with a decrease in depressive mood.  Additionally, individuals\u2019 level of mastery prior to the transition was associated with differences in depressive mood during the adjustment period.  These results suggest the importance of studying depressive mood in response to major life events and considering how risk and protective factors may influence individuals\u2019 responses to these events.          \nIn Study 2, 164 family caregivers of individual\u2019s with dementia were examined with daily diaries assessing their mood, health, and care tasks over eight consecutive days.  In addition caregivers collected five saliva samples daily.  The aim of Study 2 was to assess the association of diurnal cortisol patterns with depressive mood and anger in the caregivers.  In unconditional models, a blunted, mean-level cortisol awakening response (CAR) was associated with greater depressed mood and a below average variation in area under the curve (AUC) cortisol was associated with greater anger.  In conditional models including daily stressors, a greater frequency of care-related stressors and poorer sleep quality were associated with depressed mood and anger.  However, while the CAR association held with depressed mood, anger was no longer associated with AUC when additional predictors were included in the model.  These findings indicate a strong association between the blunted cortisol patterns associated with chronic stress and negative mood in caregivers.  \nIn conclusion, it is critical to examine biological, psychological, and social factors that may be associated with depressed mood in stressful contexts where individuals are at increased risk for the development of mental health problems.  By fully understanding these contexts and associations, interventions may be forged to prevent or reverse the course of mental health problems that take away from a healthy and fulfilling late-adulthood.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8680], "author_name_tesi": "Leggett, Amanda Noel", "last_name_ssi": "Leggett", "middle_name_ssi": "Noel", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "David Manuel Almeida", "Dr J Douglas Coatsworth", "John Walter Graham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Dissertation Advisor", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Dr J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member", "John Walter Graham, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["depression", "late-life", "control", "long-term care", "cortisol", "caregiving", "anger"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Molecular Design in Chemical and Biological Systems", "id": "6425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "515", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focus of this thesis is the development of methods for computational molecular design with the goal to aid the experimentalist and reduce laboratory cost. Two topical complexes are treated: small molecules that are of interest in the chemical industry and much larger protein molecules in biological systems. These two types of molecules require the use of different structure-property relationships and \nmethodical approaches of how the search is conducted.\n\nIn the first part, the combination of quantum chemical methods with optimization techniques for molecular design of small molecules is examined. A hydrofluorocarbon refrigerant design example and a solvent design example illustrate the proposed framework. The hydrofluorocarbon compounds are optimized for their heats of formation and the potential solvents are \nsearched for capacity, selectivity and environmental safety. In both examples, a genetic algorithm is applied to generate and screen candidate molecules. The molecular properties are evaluated using a combination of quantum chemical calculations and group contribution methods. The feasibility of the proposed approach for small molecules is assessed and it is found that establishing a proper trade-off between accuracy of the quantum chemical method and computational expense is vital.\n\nIn the second part, optimization techniques are combined with force field methods for protein design. The focus here lies on making a clear distinction in how to account for different protein properties such as protein stability and function. A framework is proposed for predicting promising mutants of a protein with improved\nbinding functionality for a known ligand of this protein. The method is applied to two design examples. The first example validates the method by comparing computationally designed mutations \nwith experimental data.

Frankenmuth, the sole \u201cHistoric Settlement turned Theme Town\u201d of this study, although still drawing on its substance, far more emphasizes its surface, its Bavarian village architecture, in its tourist marketing efforts.  \nIn this study, Hermann, Missouri, was selected as a prominent example of a town with a distinct and identifiable authentic German heritage and ways.  The towns of Leavenworth, Washington, and Helen, Georgia, will be included in this study as examples of perceived or assumed German culture.  They will serve as examples in our discussion of the phenomenon of the creation of German \u201cTheme Towns,\u201d which do not have any actual German heritage at all, in different areas of the United States.  These places are attractive because they give the appearance of German culture, since they adopted an alpine Bavarian architectural theme in the sixties and seventies.

This, on the other hand, brings with it a danger to over-accentuate certain stereotypical aspects of the heritage, which can sometimes even lead to distortion and actual falsification.  We have to keep in mind, however, that we are not dealing with the actual culture of Germany proper, but with German culture in the United States.  We also must remember that we are not talking about groups like the Amish and Mennonites, who to this day have maintained their unique way of life, separate from their \u201cEnglish\u201d neighbors, ever since establishing their communities in North America.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1635], "author_name_tesi": "Lehmann, Dirk ", "last_name_ssi": "Lehmann", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dirk", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francis Gerard Gentry", "A Gregg Roeber", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "William Pencak", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francis Gerard Gentry, Committee Chair", "A Gregg Roeber, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "William Pencak, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heritage tourism", "theme towns", "tourism", "historic settlements", "German immigration", "Leavenworth Washington", "Frankenmuth Michigan", "Helen Georgia", "Hermann Missouri", "German settlement", "German", "wine", "Lutheran missionaries"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Characterizing the X-ray Properties and Evolution of Distant Galaxies Using Deep Extragalactic Surveys\n\n", "id": "7899", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "656", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the advent of deep extragalactic X-ray surveys conducted using the Chandra X-ray Observatory (Chandra), it has now become possible to investigate the X-ray properties and evolution of distant populations of \"normal\" galaxies.  Normal galaxies have X-ray emission that originates primarily from X-ray binary populations, supernovae, supernova remnants, hot interstellar gas, and O-stars; these galaxies are not heavily influenced by the presence of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  In this thesis, I study the X-ray properties and evolution of normal galaxy populations over significant fractions of cosmic history, which for some populations extends from the present day to cosmic look-back times that correspond to 85-95% of the age of the Universe (i.e., z ~ 3-6).  These studies have been carried out using two of the most well-studied extragalactic multiwavelength survey fields: the 2 Ms Chandra Deep Field-North (CDF-N) and the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (E-CDF-S), which is composed of the central 1 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) and four flanking 250 ks Chandra observations (see Chapter 2 for an extensive discussion of these observations).  These Chandra Deep Fields (CDFs) are the most sensitive X-ray surveys yet conducted and are complemented by extensive multiwavelength coverage (e.g., through GALEX, HST, Spitzer, Keck, NOAO, SCUBA, VLA, VLT).  The combination of the deep Chandra data from the CDFs and their coincident multiwavelength observations have allowed for effective investigations of galaxy populations selected via morphological type, physical properties, and environment.\n\nIt is predicted that as galaxy populations assembled (via star-formation and galaxy/galaxy interactions) and aged passively (e.g., through dynamical relaxation, aging of stellar populations, and cooling of hot gas) into the diverse galaxy population that we observe in the local universe, the dominant X-ray properties (e.g., X-ray binaries and hot gas) of normal galaxies correspondingly evolved dramatically.  In this thesis, I provide significant new constraints and insight into how the global X-ray properties evolved in response to the physical changes that the galaxy populations underwent.  This is achieved through investigations of (1) the X-ray properties and evolution of early-type (E-S0) galaxies over the last half of cosmic time (i.e., since z ~ 0.7; Chapter 3), (2) the demographics and properties of intermediate-redshift (z ~ 0.05-0.3) off-nuclear X-ray sources within normal galaxies (Chapter 4), (3) the X-ray properties and evolution of late-type (Sa-Irr) galaxies over the last ~70% of cosmic history (i.e., since z ~ 1.4; Chapter 5), and (4) the average X-ray properties of distant (z ~3, 4, 5, and 6) Lyman break galaxies and their AGN content (Chapter 6).\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [652], "author_name_tesi": "Lehmer, Bret D", "last_name_ssi": "Lehmer", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Bret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["W Nielsen Brandt", "Donald P Schneider", "Michael Eracleous", "Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Douglas Cowen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["W Nielsen Brandt, Committee Chair", "Donald P Schneider, Committee Member", "Michael Eracleous, Committee Member", "Caryl Ann Gronwall, Committee Member", "Douglas Cowen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["normal galaxies", "astronomy", "X-rays", "Chandra"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Heroic Sublime in Renaissance Epic: Tasso, Spenser, Milton", "id": "13320kub206", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13320", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project brings together two major topics in literary history: Renaissance epic poetry and the sublime. While the sublime, a concept of divine transcendence and transport, has been the subject of numerous studies in recent decades, scholars have only begun to explore its \u201cprehistory\u201d in the early modern period, between the fifteenth-century recovery of Longinus\u2019 manuscript Per\u00ec H\u00fdpsous (On the Sublime) and the treatise\u2019s popularization by Nicolas Boileau in 1674. The sublime is especially illuminating to Renaissance epic, I argue, for it qualifies the neo-Aristotelian/Horatian principle usually assumed to apply to the genre: that the telos of epic is ethical and civic, intended to shape good citizens and build a moral society. Examining the connection between epic and sublimity allows us to refine the Renaissance concept of the heroic: not only is it the pursuit of ethical or civic duty, but it is also the enthusiastic participation in divine transcendence. I term this model of epic the heroic sublime. As an epic mode, the heroic sublime involves an inherently sacred element of individual aspiration for the divine\u2014a quest for unity with God and transformation of self. Renaissance heroes, by cooperating with the impulses of divine ecstasy, reach beyond the material realm toward a transcendent one, achieving a condition in which the mind stands outside itself in pursuit of divine knowledge. Situating the heroic sublime in major debates and developments of the Protestant Reformation, with which Longinus\u2019 core principles were seen to intersect, my dissertation argues that Torquato Tasso, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton use a concept of the heroic sublime to reimagine the nature of Christian heroism as it pertains to the human relationship to self, to God, and to community. As epic heroes pursue transcendence, their boundaries of self are occluded as they form a spiritual community oriented toward divine relationship. Ultimately, as they participate in the sublime, encountering a divine object greater than the self, they realize the full value of the self.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13104], "author_name_tesi": "Lehtonen, Kelly ", "last_name_ssi": "Lehtonen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Cheney", "Patrick Cheney", "Caroline Eckhardt", "David Loewenstein", "Sherry Roush"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Cheney, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Cheney, Committee Chair", "Caroline Eckhardt, Committee Member", "David Loewenstein, Committee Member", "Sherry Roush, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sublime", "epic", "Reformation", "Tasso", "Spenser", "Milton", "heroism", "abjection", "charisma", "self", "community"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of a T cell based cancer immunotherapy by using the induced pluripotent stem cell ", "id": "18747", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cancer is one of the leading health issues that has caused tremendous impacts. Conquering cancer is imminent and finding more potent treatments to cancer is also urgent. In searching for novel anti-cancer regimens, recently, a new concept of cancer immunotherapy has been proposed. It is found that by using adoptive T cell transfer (ACT)-based immunotherapy, tumor regression can be achieved. However, a major problem of this strategy is the shortage of T cells for transfer. Previous work has shown that stem cells are good candidates for generating T cell for therapeutic purposes; however, there are many hurdles existed. The recent discovery of the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology hints that iPS cells are potential substitutes of natural stem cells for generating T cells being used in cancer immunotherapy.\nThe hypothesis of my research is iPS cell is identical to other stem cells in the context of T lineage differentiation, and furthermore, iPS cell can be engineered and induced into antigen specific T cell to bolster the tumor immune surveillance.\nIn the first study, it is observed iPS cells are able to differentiate into conventional T cells after in vitro Notch signaling pathway ligand stimulation. In vitro developed iPS cells express general T cell markers, respond to costimulatory signal activation and reconstitute the T cell pools of the recipient lymphopenic mice. Following this, a second work showed antigen-specific T cells are induced from iPS cells through the T cell receptor (TCR) signal stimulation. In short, genetically modifying iPS cells with antigen-specific TCR can promote the development of corresponding T cells in vivo and developed T cells are functional in terms of responding to antigen stimulation and managing tumor growth. Further analyses suggested that both Notch and TCR signals may be involved, in a synergistic manner, in inducing iPS cells to develop into T cells; and probably, this process is mediated by the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling pathway. \nThese studies have initially supported our hypothesis however both extensive and intensive studies are still needed to further test our central hypothesis. In conclusion, my dissertation study served as the first series of proof-of-concept work to investigate the feasibility of an iPS cell-based, personalized cancer immunotherapy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8613], "author_name_tesi": "Lei, Fengyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Lei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fengyang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jianxun Song", "Jianxun Song", "Neil David Christensen", "Todd Schell", "John Warren Wills", "Jiyue Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jianxun Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Jianxun Song, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stem cell", "T cell", "differentiation", "immunotherapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "important regulators of plant cellulose synthesis", "id": "26349", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11779", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cellulose, the world\u2019s most abundant organic compound, is a carbohydrate, composed of several hundred to many thousands of glucose units. Because of the compact sugar molecules in cellulose, it is both a food source for herbivores and a great candidate for alternative biofuel. Plants are the major producers of cellulose on earth. Understanding how plants make cellulose is of the essence. Plant cellulose synthesis is catalyzed by a group of membrane-bound glycosyltransferases, named Cellulose Synthases (CESAs). Genetic studies have revealed that mutations in CESA genes lead to defective cellulose production in plant cell walls. Through forward genetic screens and CESA-interactive protein screens, several non-CESA genes were identified as important regulators for cellulose synthesis in plants. In this dissertation, three of these are discussed in detail: Cellulose Synthase Interactive 1 (CSI1), Cellulose Synthase Interactive 3 (CSI3), and Glycosyl Hydrolase of Family 9 Class A 1 (GH9A1). CSI1 links CESA and microtubules and is the first characterized CESA-interactive protein shown to play a key role in the regulation of cellulose microfibril patterning. More importantly, CSI1 provides a molecular mechanism that explains a long-standing question in the plant biology field: how the patterning of extracellular cellulose microfibrils and intracellular microtubules are coordinated. A CSI1-like protein, Cellulose Synthase Interactive 3 (CSI3), is similar to CSI1 in a lot of aspects but not only an equivalent of CSI1. CSI3 can regulate cellulose biosynthesis in both a microtubule dependent and microtubule independent manner. GH9A1 is an endoglucanase that is important for cellulose synthesis and regulates the organization of both cellulose microfibrils and microtubules in plants. Hopefully, the knowledge we gained from Arabidopsis research will help us understand how cellulose is synthesized in plants and make a better use of cellulose in the near future.

It is first developed and tested in simplified models, the Lorenz three-variable system and a more realistic 2D shallow water model, with simulated observations, and then in a full-physics 3D mesoscale model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, using real observations.  \n\nThe HNEnKF uses the EnKF to obtain a flow-dependent / time-dependent background error covariance matrix that can be used to compute a flow-dependent / time-varying nudging coefficient matrix.   It also extends the nudging magnitude matrix to include the inter-variable influences of innovations via nonzero off-diagonal elements of the EnKF gain matrix.  This additional coupling between the observations and the multivariate state may lead to a faster and more accurate adjustment of the background to observations than does traditional nudging.  By use of nudging-type terms, the HNEnKF applies the EnKF gradually in time to achieve a more gradual data assimilation that greatly reduces the insertion noise common with intermittent methods such as the EnKF.  Thus it combines the strengths of nudging and the EnKF while avoiding their individual weaknesses.  \n\nIn the Lorenz three-variable system, the HNEnKF promotes a better fit of an analysis to data compared to that produced by nudging.  When model error is introduced, it produces similar or better RMS errors compared to the EnKF while minimizing the error spikes / discontinuities created by the intermittent EnKF.  It provides a continuous data assimilation with better inter-variable consistency and improved temporal smoothness than that of the EnKF.  Compared to the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS), considered to be a \u201cgold standard\u201d in statistical data assimilation methods, the HNEnKF has similar or better temporal smoothness with much smaller CPU time and data storage requirements.\n\nIn the 2D shallow water model, a quasi-stationary wave case and a moving vortex case are used to investigate the data assimilation methods.  The HNEnKF generally produces smaller RMS errors in both the height and wind fields than the nudging and EnKF applied separately.  The HNEnKF also has better temporal smoothness than the EnKF and the more practical and computationally efficient lagged EnKS used in the shallow water model.  The HNEnKF takes advantage of the EnKF by effectively reducing the RMS errors through the flow-dependent background error covariances, and also retains the benefits of the continuous nudging by reducing the RMS errors gradually over time. Moreover, the HNEnKF produces a smoother evolution of the ageostrophic wind without any strong discontinuities / dynamic imbalances around the observation time, while the EnKF exhibits large bursts in the ageostrophic wind after the observations are assimilated.  \n\nThe HNEnKF is further tested in the 3D WRF model with real observations using a Cross Appalachian Tracer Experiment case from September 1983 (CAPTEX-83).  The HNEnKF generally has better posteriors of the wind and mass fields than the EnKF, although both HNEnKF and EnKF have larger posterior RMS errors than the observation-nudging four dimensional data assimilation (FDDA).  The HNEnKF has similar or better priors of the wind and mass fields than the EnKF and FDDA in general.  Moreover, the continuous HNEnKF has much lower noise levels as shown by the domain average absolute surface pressure tendency than the intermittent EnKF.  Thus the ability of the HNEnKF to provide better temporal smoothness and dynamic consistency than the EnKF is further demonstrated. The HNEnKF analyses used in an atmospheric transport and dispersion (AT&D) model produce consistently better statistics of hits, misses and false alarms than the EnKF in the independent / indirect verification using the surface tracer data.  Thus there appears to be some advantage in the WRF dynamic analyses produced by the continuous HNEnKF compared to the intermittent EnKF, and proof-of-concept for this new hybrid data assimilation approach improving analyses and numerical predictions has been demonstrated.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3902], "author_name_tesi": "Lei, Lili ", "last_name_ssi": "Lei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lili", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Stauffer", "David R Stauffer", "George Spencer Young", "Sue Ellen Haupt", "Qiang Du"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Stauffer, Dissertation Advisor", "David R Stauffer, Committee Chair", "George Spencer Young, Committee Member", "Sue Ellen Haupt, Committee Member", "Qiang Du, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nudging", "EnKF", "insertion noise", "hybrid data assimilation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "COUPLED PHENOMENA IN DOMAINS AND DOMAIN WALLS IN COMPLEX POLAR OXIDES", "id": "14825sul46", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14825", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Complex oxides represent a family of solid state materials that possesses a wide spectrum of properties, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, large nonlinear optical response and metal-to-insulator transition. One type of such materials in the focus of the current work is polar materials, where the charge centers of the anions and cations are shifted relative to each other. The criteria whether the polar-axis exists or not thus divides all materials into two type \u2014 polar or nonpolar. From the symmetry point of view, the appearance of polar axis or inversion symmetry breaking naturally leads to a crystal lattice with lower symmetry and the introduction of a certain order, just like the phase transformation from water to ice. The appearance of domain microstructure is a direct consequence when such symmetry lowering process happens. It is the existence of domain structure, its tunability, and its ability to couple with other order parameters that gives rise to a plethora of interesting coupled phenomena and make polar materials extremely useful for a wide range of applications. The rich coupled phenomena and their mechanisms are the center focus of this work.\nIn Chapter 2, a systematic finite element modeling (FEM) approach was applied in understanding the quantitative piezoelectric origin of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) response across a 180\u00b0 domain walls. Using FEM simulations, the coupled PFM response from each individual piezoelectric coefficient is conveniently decoupled, thus building a bridge between the measured PFM response and intrinsic piezoelectric properties of a ferroelectric material. In order to understand the coupled piezoresponse across domain walls, complete three-component piezoresponse line-profiles are calculated, allowing a direct comparison with experiments. While excellent agreement is achieved on vertical PFM (VPFM) response between experiments and theory, less satisfactory agreement is found in the lateral PFM (LPFM) response. Additionally, a new component of piezoresponse is predicted near the wall.  A new approach to evaluate the tip-sample contact radius is also proposed and verified experimentally.\nIn Chapter 3, based on the domain wall symmetry argument, a decoupling treatment of VPFM response is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to isolate the in-plane and out-of-plane piezoresponse contribution, thus allowing the achievement of three-dimensional piezoresponse from a single imaging geometry. The experimental VPFM and LPFM line-profiles after decoupling treatment show good agreements with the predicted ones from FEM simulations. In this Chapter, the background subtraction process is also demonstrated to be critical in reproducing the intrinsic piezoresponse phase contrast across the antiparallel domain wall. \nIn Chapter 4, a first direct observation of ferroelectric-like polar domains in a polar metal is provided. The quasi-two-dimensional polar domain has large aspect ratio of ~103-104. This is beyond the domain geometry described by the general Kittel-Mitsui-Furuichi law, which gives the aspect ratio of ~10. The appearance of polar domains in a polar metal is found to be related to the geometric effect rather than the electrostatic effect from DFT calculations. The large aspect ratio of polar domains is found to be related to the reduced electrostatic energy due to the effective electronic screening. This suggests the role of conducting carriers in stabilizing the quasi-two-dimensional geometry of polar domains. Importantly, a first-order quasi-phase-matching effect is demonstrated on thin polar domains (thickness ~10 nm), paving a route to mirror-less optical parametric oscillators using the first-order quasi-phase-matching effect.\nIn Chapter 5, results of detailed second harmonic generation, resistivity, specific heat, magnetization and neutron diffraction studies are provided to give a comprehensive picture on the magnetic phase diagrams for a polar material Ca3(Ru0.95Fe0.05)2O7.  Although the polar mechanism is driven by the hybrid improper mechanism and the structure is also isostructural to the prototype material Ca3Mn2O7, the magnetoelastic coupling mechanism shows distinctively different behaviors from that in Ca3Mn2O7. The coexistence of weak ferromagnetism and magnetoelastic coupling in the polar material Ca3(Ru0.95Fe0.05)2O7 suggests a new route for ME coupling: an improper polar lattice distortion plus the metastable incommensurate weak ferromagnetic order\nIn Chapter 6, I propose two future research topics based on some preliminary results that can be further pursued for better understanding on the domains/domain walls involved coupling phenomena. Two material systems are proposed for these future works, one is a tetragonal ferroelectric PbTiO3 and the other one is a polar metal Ca3Ru2O7. Theoretical studies such as phase-field simulations and DFT calculations are proposed as well to provide guidance on practical experiment design and lend theoretical support for the experimental observations.

This research presents a new approach to design and supplier selection, and purchasing decisions that makes use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS).

The approach involves constructing a multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to help the management select suitable designs and suppliers along with optimum order quantities, where several objectives are optimized (e.g., cost, carbon footprint, budget, demand, etc.). The user-friendly software is implemented, using existing technologies (e.g., Geotools and WorldWind for GIS spatial data information and geo mapping of facilities location, and OptimJ for the MIP model solving). With the implementation of this system, companies can efficiently make design and supplier selection choices.

Current artificial surfaces, unlike native vascular surfaces, are not able to control clot and thrombus formation.  Protein interactions are an important component in hemocompatibility and can result in decreased patency due to thrombus formation or surface passivation which can improve endothelization.  It is believed that controlling these properties, specifically the nanometer sizes of the fibers on the material's surface, will allow for better control of biological responses.  The biocompatibility of Teflon, a widely used polymer for vascular grafts, would be improved with nanostructured control of surface features.\nDue to the difficultly in processing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), it has not been possible to create nanofibrous PTFE surfaces.  The novel technique of Jet Blowing allows for the formation of nanostructured PTFE (nPTFE).  A systematic investigation into controlling polymer properties by varying the processing conditions of temperature, pressure, and gas used in the Jet Blowing allows for an increased understanding of the effects of plasticization on the material\u2019s properties.  This fundamental understanding of the material science behind the Jet Blowing process has enabled control of the micro and nanoscale structure of nPTFE.  \nWhile protein adsorption, a key component of biocompatibility, has been widely studied, it is not fully understood.  Major problems in the field of biomaterials include a lack of standard protocols to measure biocompatibility, and inconstant literature on protein adsorption.  A reproducible protocol for measuring protein adsorption onto superhydrophobic surfaces (ePTFE and nPTFE) has been developed.  Both degassing of PBS buffer solutions and evacuation of the air around the expanded PTFE (ePTFE) prior to contact with protein solutions are essential.  Protein adsorption experiments show a four-fold difference in the measure of proteins adsorbed using radiometry (I-125 labeled human serum albumin (HSA)) and electrophoresis (unlabeled HSA).  This provides evidence that the standard method of radiolabeled protein for measuring adsorption does not fully account for changes to the HSA molecules due to labeling.  The differences between measured protein values can be attributed to the radiolabel affecting the HSA hydrophobicity resulting in a change in the protein\u2019s interactions with the hydrophobic surface.  Additionally, our work has provided repeatable results showing that the amount of protein adsorbed onto the polymer surface, after washing, accounted for only 65% of the amount of protein that was removed from solution based on depletion analysis.  This implies that measurement of the amount of strongly bound protein on the material significantly underestimates the actual amount of protein adsorbing into the surface region of the material interface.  HSA adsorption isotherms demonstrate an increase in protein adsorption capacity on the nPTFE surface compared to adsorption on the same surface area of ePTFE.  \n Preliminary cell work shows that the nPTFE surfaces had a larger number of cells growing on the surface of the material when compared to ePTFE surfaces.  The research also shows that while most endothelial cells were not viable on the ePTFE surface after 96 hours, they remained alive on the nPTFE surface during that same time period.  Surface functionalization using ammonia plasma has been performed.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of amine groups on the nPTFE surface.  The amine groups can be used to couple polypeptides onto the PTFE surface in the future.  The selection of different peptides will allow for selective control of cell adhesion.  This research shows that nPTFE has potential for improved biocompatibility over standard ePTFE, based on increased protein adsorption capacity, increased viability of endothelial cells, and the ability to plasma modify the PTFE surface.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1841], "author_name_tesi": "Leibner, Evan Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Leibner", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John V Badding", "John V Badding", "Michael Pishko", "Erwin A Vogler", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Paul Wencil Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John V Badding, Dissertation Advisor", "John V Badding, Committee Chair", "Michael Pishko, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Paul Wencil Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hemocompatible", "Polytetrafluoroethylene", "Jet Blowing", "Potein Adsorption"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of BAC-Based Reporters for the Study of Human Telomerase\n", "id": "7450", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3969", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ongoing efforts to sequence eukaryotic genomes have revealed that contrary to initial predictions, more complex organisms do not necessarily have more complex genomes or more genes.  Instead, it has been shown that higher eukaryotes have more complex gene regulatory mechanisms, leading to increased organismal complexity.  Understanding the ways in which genes are regulated is critical to understanding how organisms function in normal and diseased states.  Many techniques and model systems have been used to study gene regulation, including transgenic mice and cell lines and promoter analysis via reporter genes.  Some of the biggest problems when studying gene regulation are the susceptibility of transgenes to position effect variegation (PEV) and copy number dependence.  To alleviate these problems, techniques have been developed to introduce transgenes in a single copy at predetermined genomic loci.  Another concern when using standard transgenes to study gene regulation is that they do not always mimic the expression patterns of the endogenous locus, either because they do not contain all appropriate regulatory elements and/or are unable to re-form the native chromatin environment.  The use of yeast, bacterial, and P1 artificial chromosomes (YACs, BACs, and PACs, respectively) as transgenes has been shown to increase the likelihood that a transgene will be expressed in an endogenous manner due to the increased amount of genomic sequence they harbor.  Therefore, transgenics created using artificial chromosomes targeted in a single copy to a predetermined genomic locus should be very beneficial to the study of gene regulation.\n\tOne gene that would benefit from such a system is human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT).  TERT encodes a reverse transcriptase specific for telomeres, the tandemly repeated sequence located at the ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes that, in addition to their associated proteins, serve as caps to prevent critical genetic information from being lost due to the end replication problem and protect chromosomes from end-to-end fusions.  In humans, TERT is expressed at high levels during embryogenesis, but in adult somatic cells, TERT is silenced; however, in 85-90% of all human tumors, telomerase is reactivated.  The correlation between a lack of telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA seems to suggest telomerase expression is regulated predominantly at the level of transcription; however, despite almost 25 years of study, the mechanisms of hTERT regulation have remained elusive.  One of the main reasons for this is the lack of a powerful model system.  Mice, which are often used to study human genes, are not good models for studying hTERT because mTERT expression is much more promiscuous than that of hTERT and their overall telomere length is much longer.  Additionally, transiently expressed, hTERT promoter-based reporters do not always mimic the endogenous telomerase activity of the cells into which they are introduced.\n\tWe hypothesized that an hTERT reporter created from a BAC introduced in a single copy to a preexisting acceptor locus via recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) would be able to mimic the endogenous telomerase expression patterns of genetically related telomerase positive (TERT(+)) and telomerase negative (TERT(-)) cells.  To test this hypothesis, an acceptor locus containing a tkNeo fusion gene and Cre recombinase fused to the estrogen receptor under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter and the Cre recombinase recognition sites loxP and lox511 surrounded by single copies of the chicken \u0192\u00d2-globin insulator, cHS4, was created and introduced into genetically related TERT(+) and (-) cells via retroviral integration.  (These TERT(+) and (-) cells were immortal clones that arose after IMR-90 human fibroblasts stably expressing SV40 large T and small t antigens survived crisis.)  Overall, five TERT(+) and three TERT(-) cell lines containing the acceptor locus at a single site were identified.  Several BAC reporters were constructed by inserting the firefly, Renilla, and hRenilla luciferase open reading frames into the start codons of CRR9 and TERT, as well as the puromycin resistance gene (puro) into the vector backbone, of the hTERT-containing BAC RP11-117B23 using a two-step homologous recombination technique in bacteria termed recombineering.  Smaller RMCE-competent plasmids were also created using recombineering by introducing puro into the base BAC vectors.\n\tThe ability of the acceptor locus-containing TERT(+) and TERT(-) cells to undergo RMCE was verified using the plasmid-based BAC vectors.  Attempts to target both circular and linear hTERT-containing BAC reporters to the acceptor locus were unsuccessful in both TERT(+) and (-) cells.  Random integration of linearized BAC reporters to the genome of acceptor locus-containing TERT(+) and (-) cells resulted in a total of 186 stable integrants.  Analysis of these clones by luciferase assay, Southern hybridization, and PCR amplification revealed that only 12 of these 186 clones (6.45%) appeared to be intact after integration and were therefore useful for addressing the modified hypothesis that BAC-based hTERT reporters would be able to mimic endogenous telomerase expression upon their introduction to genetically related TERT(+) and (-) cells.  All 12 of these clones (seven TERT(+) and five TERT(-)) expressed high-level CRR9 expression, as read out by firefly luciferase activity, and low-level TERT expression, as read out by Renilla luciferase activity.  Therefore, BAC-based hTERT reporters do not appear to mimic endogenous telomerase expression patterns in genetically related, crisis-derived TERT(+) and (-) human fibroblasts.    \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3941], "author_name_tesi": "Leiby, Melanie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Leiby", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue", "Sarah Bronson", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Mary Judith Tevethia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Mary Judith Tevethia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bacterial artificial chromosomes", "transcriptional regulation", "telomerase", "recombineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A FRAMEWORK FOR PLANNING EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION USING INTERACTIVE WORKSPACES\n", "id": "9442", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent trends within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction Industry have increased interest in building information models and their impact on the integrated delivery of projects.

Although approximately half of couples report their conflicts end with some form of positivity, little is known regarding how positive behaviors may affect aggression perpetration over time. While generally thought to be beneficial to relationships and reflect capacity to problem solve or recover from conflict, an alternative hypothesis is tested such that positivity received immediately after aggression perpetration may reinforce individuals\u2019 aggression perpetration over time. Using dyadic growth curve modeling among 63 bidirectionally aggressive community couples, I modeled the effect of receiving positivity (i.e.., apologies, intimacy, support) during or immediately following aggression perpetration on the frequency of husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 aggression perpetration over an approximate one-year period. I also modeled the moderating role of depression symptoms on the association between positivity and aggression perpetration, hypothesizing that depression may dampen the conditioning effect of positivity. Among wives, receipt of intimacy was associated with a linear increase in aggression perpetration over time. Among husbands, receipt of support prevented the natural decline in their aggression perpetration over time, suggesting it maintained their aggression perpetration. There was limited support for the moderating role of depression. In addition, findings seem unique to positivity within aggressive incidents, as a measure of general relationship satisfaction did not predict trajectories of aggression perpetration.

As a result, iron deficiency (ID), which is the most common nutritional disorder in the world, is associated with a variety of functional deficits that can result in long-term neurological impairments. The focus of my thesis is the iron storage protein ferritin and its receptor Tim2 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 2). The Tim2 receptor is expressed by oligodendrocytes in the brain and the interaction between ferritin and the Tim2 receptor is important for iron delivery and differentiation. The thesis begins with an overview of iron homeostasis. In Chapter 2, I provide a background on ID and report the results of rat and cell culture models of ID. In addition to ferritin, Tim2 also interacts with Semaphorin4A (Sema4A), which has been implicated as a cytotoxic agent for oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis. We investigated the effect of Sema4A on oligodendrocytes in Chapter 3 and also in a model of neuroinflammatory disease known to have myelin damage, cerebral malaria (CM). We investigated the pathogenesis of CM in mouse models of dietary ID and genetic iron overload (H67D HFE). Our findings give insight into the pathogenesis of CM under varying conditions of iron dyshomeostasis and provide implications for therapeutic strategies in treating ID and CM.\nIn summary, my thesis has shown that 1) Tim2 expression by oligodendrocytes is responsive to changes in iron availability, 2) Sema4A is cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes and elevated in the brain in models of neuroinflammation, and 3) it is possible for iron to be present in normal or even elevated levels without exacerbating CM as long as the inflammatory response to parasitemia is limited.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10463], "author_name_tesi": "Leitner, Dominique Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Leitner", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Dominique", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Hanspeter Waldner", "Jennifer W Baccon", "Richard Bruce Tenser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Hanspeter Waldner, Committee Member", "Jennifer W Baccon, Special Member", "Richard Bruce Tenser, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["iron", "Tim2", "Sema4A", "cerebral malaria", "oligodendrocyte", "myelin", "Epo", "IL-6"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Three-Dimensional Modeling of Wood Moment Connections\n\n", "id": "11749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1787", "abstract_tesi": "Small-scale wooden moment connections were tested under cyclic loading.

My research objectives were to study the behavior of this beetle and other members of the genus Agrilus also present in North America to find pre-mating behaviors that could be exploited to create a more species-specific and effective trap for EAB than is currently available in the toolkit for monitoring this invasive pest.  \nThe first series of experiments I conducted were designed to elucidate activity patterns and mate-finding behaviors of EAB in the field and laboratory.  I conducted behavioral observations of virgin pairs of EAB of known ages and recorded behaviors that might be related to mate-finding or courtship, such as wing-fanning, \u2018juddering\u2019 or body-vibration, contact and mounting behavior by males.  I also extensively observed EAB in the field, looking specifically for gender-specific behaviors and diurnal activity periods that might hint at how the beetles locate their mates in a natural setting.  Males are more active during the day, and both sexes strongly prefer sunlit perches on the host plant.  Male EAB perform pre-copulatory flights that end in rapid dives onto the backs of stationary conspecifics, and are attracted to both dead male and dead female beetles pinned to host plant leaves, suggesting the use of a visual cue to locate mates.  \nMy next step was to take my work to the field and used the knowledge I gained about the mating system of EAB to create a male-specific trap that may help to monitor the spread of this pest.  My first method of trap construction was to attach a dead EAB to an ash leaflet and cover the leaflet in a spray-on adhesive; this simple strategy was effective at capturing adult male EAB.  I then tested these simple traps at both high and low EAB population-density and at high and low heights in ash trees.  As I had hypothesized based upon my earlier behavioral observations and experiments, traps captured more EAB at higher heights and higher population densities, and always captured a strongly male-biased sample of adult EAB.  I then performed a series of trapping experiments to potentially improve the design of the trap, including using synthetic materials with and without dead EAB and chemical cues as lures for adult EAB.  This series of experiments culminated in a broad comparison of my trap types against USDA APHIS monitoring traps.  I have now shown that on a surface-area basis, my traps are more effective than a plastic purple prism trap for capturing adult EAB in the field.  My research has also contributed to a change in APHIS\u2019 monitoring regime from purple to green traps.\nI have also performed investigations into the chemical cues used by EAB to assess a contacted conspecific for gender.  By examining the cuticular chemistry of newly emerged and mature adult EAB of both genders, I have shown, in collaboration with other researchers, that female EAB cuticular chemistry changes as the beetle matures.  This change coincides with sexual activity in the laboratory.  Further, use of a specific cuticular hydrocarbon, 3-methyltricosane, can increase the time spent investigating a dead beetle by live, adult male EAB.  This is a first step toward identification of the contact sex pheromone used by adult (presumably male) EAB to assess a contacted conspecific for gender information, and has increased our understanding of the mating system of this insect.\nThough the focus of this work is Agrilus planipennis, I also performed comparative studies on the mating behaviors of two other species in the target genus Agrilus:  A. subcinctus, a native ash-twig borer, and A. cyanescens, an introduced insect that feeds upon invasive plants in the genus Lonicera.  My work on these insects shows that males of both species also appear to use visual cues to locate mates in a way similar to that of male EAB.  Indeed, male A. cyanescens are even attracted to non-conspecific insects of similar color and can be induced to attempt to copulate with these non-conspecific lures, even off of the primary host plant.  My experimental results strongly suggested that vision is the primary mode of mate location in my three target species.  These comparative studies helped to further the depth of understanding we have about mating behaviors in both EAB and Buprestid beetles in general.  \nIn summary, my work has increased scientific understanding of the mating systems of three species of Agrilus beetles in the family Buprestidae.  I have assessed the use of vision and contact chemistry in the mating systems of these beetles, and I have tested and improved a novel trap using a visual cue as a lure for a pest insect.  This knowledge has allowed us to ask new questions regarding the roles of vision and cuticular chemistry in insects, and has added to the information available to researchers and regulatory officials concerned with slowing the spread of an invasive insect, the emerald ash borer. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2927], "author_name_tesi": "Lelito, Jonathan Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Lelito", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Charles Baker", "Thomas Charles Baker", "James Lewis Frazier", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "James Harold Marden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Charles Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Chair", "James Lewis Frazier, Committee Member", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["invasive insect", "mating system", "Fraxinus", "Agrilus", "ash", "Buprestidae"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "How Young Children's Disabilities Affect Parents' Labor Force Participation and Earnings", "id": "26719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11865", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children\u2019s disabilities are negatively associated with mothers\u2019 labor force participation.

One expression of this uncertainty is the debate surrounding the use of the multifunctionality argument in agricultural trade negotiations. Accordingly, agriculture should be treated differently in global trade negotiations because of its unique contribution to society. This position is championed by the European Union (EU), among others, and received a mixed reaction from the United States. The scholarly debate on multifunctional agriculture has also been mixed. Some argue that the use of this concept in global trade negotiations represents a form of rearguard protectionism, while others optimistically claim that it points towards a post-productivist transition. Still others claim it serves to legitimate the liberalization process. This dissertation seeks to clarify the meaning of multifunctional agriculture as a policy concept, by focusing on the various discursive arenas where it is debated. The purpose of the study is to determine whether or not there is a hegemonic definition of the concept at the global level of governance, and how this definition is diffused to the state and local level of governance. In order to investigate this issue the public discourse on multifunctional agriculture that arose from the policy debates surrounding the Green Box subsidy category in the WTO negotiations, the Rural Development Regulation of the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy and the US Farm Bill Conservation Security Program are analyzed. In depth case studies of the debate surrounding the implementation of agri-environmental programs in Ireland and Pennsylvania were also conducted. The relative hegemony of a particular interpretation of agriculture\u2019s multifunctional role was determined by the degree to which it resonated among the different socio-political actors (official, mainstream farmer, sustainable agriculture, and environmental) in a given policy arena, and with similar policy actors at different levels of governance. Based on this analysis it was concluded that the hegemonic interpretation of multifunctional agriculture at the macro-level of governance largely reflected or complemented the neoliberal agenda. However, these macro-level interpretations failed to resonate with official and social movement actors at other levels of governance, who were either ambivalent or hostile towards the liberalization project, and who tended to privilege discourses that emphasized hygienic, neo-mercantilist, and agro-ecological concerns. This suggests that the extent to which the debate on agriculture\u2019s multifunctional role reflects neoliberal, post-productivist, or protectionist concerns largely depends on the level of governance which the debate is taking place, as well as the geographical context of the debate.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4118], "author_name_tesi": "Lenihan, Martin Henry", "last_name_ssi": "Lenihan", "middle_name_ssi": "Henry", "first_name_ssi": "Martin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Jo Brasier", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Richard C Stedman", "James Alan Mccarthy", "Cynthia Clare Hinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Jo Brasier, Committee Chair", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member", "Richard C Stedman, Committee Member", "James Alan Mccarthy, Committee Member", "Cynthia Clare Hinrichs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multifunctionality", "agri-environmental", "sociology of agriculture", "rural governance"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The flexed-tail (f) Mutant Mouse: Advancing the Understanding of Expansive Erythropoiesis\n\n", "id": "6608", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The autosomal, recessive flexed-tail mutant (f/f) mouse has defects at times of expansive erythropoiesis. The phenotype is evident both during development and in the adult. f/f show a transient fetal/neonatal anemia that remits shortly after birth when the main site of hematopoiesis has shifted from the fetal liver to the bone marrow. Adult mice appear normal, but show a delay in their recovery to acute anemia. Analysis of the flexed-tail (f) mutant has shown that the contribution from stress erythroid progenitors resident in the spleen responding to hypoxia-induced BMP4/Madh5 dependent signals is required for the rapid recovery to an acute anemia. The f mutation is a neomorphic mutation of Madh5, with aberrantly spliced transcripts disrupting the normal BMP4 signaling pathway in the spleen following an erythropoietic challenge. Although this splenic contribution to an acute anemia is critical for the rapid return to homeostasis, it is not essential since flexed-tail mice are viable and both humans and mice can survive without a spleen. To further understand the mechanisms of expansive erythropoiesis, we have extended our analysis to splenectomized mice. These mice show altered kinetics of recovery to a phenylhydrazine induced acute anemia with expansive erythropoiesis now seen in the liver. Further, BMP4 is expressed in the liver and liver erythroid progenitors exhibit properties similar to stress BFU-E in the spleen. This work has shown the important role of the BMP4 pathway for regulating expansive erythropoiesis in extra-medullary organs. It has also broadened our appreciation for splicing mutations, the regulations within signaling pathways, and the contribution these pathways make to signaling networks.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3726], "author_name_tesi": "Lenox, L.

The material studied is a disordered, nanoporous form of carbon, which is semiconducting in nature and is obtained from the pyrolysis of a polymeric precursor (polyfurfuryl alcohol). Unlike the other allotropes of carbon such as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes, disordered carbons lack crystalline order and therefore can exhibit a range of electronic properties, dependent on the degree of disorder, local microstructure, and temperature. The motivation for this research comes from the potential for engineering the electrical properties to desired specifications, which becomes possible only if we understand the structure-temperature-property correlations. We present experimental results connecting the changes in electrical transport of single disordered carbon nanofibers (diameter 150 \u2013 250 nm), where the degree of disorder was controlled by varying the pyrolysis temperature from 600\u00baC to 2000\u00baC.  Transmission electron and Raman microscopy, as well as dark DC electrical conductivity  characterizations indicate strong microstructure dependence, which in turn can be controlled to a great extent simply by controlling the pyrolysis temperature. To study the role of ambient temperature,  dark DC conductivity measurements were performed for nanowire surface temperature ranging from 90K to 450K. The charge transport behavior in the nanowires is observed to follow an activation-energy based conduction at high temperatures, transitioning to a hopping based mechanism below room temperature.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1051], "author_name_tesi": "Lentz, Christina Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Lentz", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Thesis Advisor", "Md Amanul Haque, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoporous carbon", "non-graphitizing carbon", "glassy carbon", "nanofibers", "electrical transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Nanostructured Elastomers: From Smectic Liquid Crystals to Noble Metal Nanocomposites\n\n", "id": "10577", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Noble metal/polymer nanocomposites are a desirable and useful class of material due to their combination of the beneficial processibility and mechanical properties of polymers with the optical, electrical, barrier, and other engineering properties of metal nanoparticles.   Potential applications of such materials include non-linear optical materials with gold nanoparticles or conductive polymer substrates with percolated silver nanoparticles.  A processing approach has been developed whereby metal nanoparticles, especially silver and gold, can be infused into the surface of a thermoplastic elastomer following the melt processing operation. This reaction-diffusion approach (nanoinfusion) allows metal nanoparticles to be introduced at relatively low cost while avoiding the issues of thermal degradation, microphase separation, or agglomeration that can occur at elevated temperatures in the melt state.  The nanoinfusion process involves immersion of a molded, cast, or extruded plastic article in an aqueous plasticizer solution (Bayer MaterialScience AURA\u00ae Infusion Technology) containing a metal salt such as HAuCl4 or AgNO3. Infusion of the metal salt into the plastic surface is achieved well below the melt-processing temperature due to plasticization of a thin surface layer of 10-500 &#956;m.  The metal salt is subsequently reduced to produce zero-valent metal nanoparticles by a second infusion of a reducing agent or a thermal or photochemical reduction process. The growth and agglomeration of the nanoparticles is arrested by the high viscosity of the polymer matrix, producing a stable nanocomposite.  \nIn order to examine how nanoparticle size distribution and concentration are affected by soak times in the salt and reducing agent solutions, combinatorial, high-throughput screening methods have been applied. Particle size distributions are characterized rapidly by small-angle x ray scattering (SAXS) using a \"dual gradient\" nanoinfusion matrix. In addition, an improved method of the nanoinfusion process has been demonstrated that displays significant enhancements to nanoparticle concentration (volume fraction) in thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPUs), as well as decreased average particle size.   This latter method involves the creation of an interpenetrating layer of a functionalized monomer via an infusion-polymerization approach.  Said functional group is subsequently used to reduce the metal precursor as it is infused using the same processing step as the above method.  TEM images show significantly higher volume fraction of nanoparticles using this method, providing the potential for more drastic improvements in optical and other properties.\nAnother material of interest for synthesis of nanocomposites are liquid crystalline elastomers.  Liquid crystalline elastomers have received attention for their unique mechanical properties, which underlie their potential for use in applications such as artificial muscles (due to the electroclinic effect) and constrained vibration damping applications (due to their broad peak in tan &#948; versus either temperature or frequency).  An interesting feature observed in the liquid crystalline elastomers produced in our groups is the formation of a neck in the sample under uniaxial tension.  The mechanical response of these smectic main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers (MCLCE) has been characterized at a variety of strain rates and temperatures in order to understand the cause of the observed neck formation.  A well-defined yield stress is observed at a critical strain that is essentially independent of strain rate, followed by necking and cold-drawing.  Cold-drawing is rarely observed in liquid crystalline elastomers, but we believe that it is observed in MCLCE due to the unfolding of hairpin chains at the start of the polydomain to monodomain transition.  A neck forms as the hairpins straighten out, resulting in a decreased cross-sectional area that promotes yielding.  Infusions of both metal nanoparticles and dichroic dyes were attempted.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1478], "author_name_tesi": "Lentz, Daniel Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Lentz", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias", "Ronald C Hedden", "Evangelos Manias", "Ralph H Colby", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Evangelos Manias, Dissertation Advisor", "Ronald C Hedden, Committee Chair", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["main chain liquid crystalline elastomers", "noble metal nanoparticles", "nanocomposites"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Reducing Helicopter Main Rotor Power Requirements Using Multiple Trailing Edge Flaps And Extendable Chord Sections\n\n", "id": "10035", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4826", "abstract_tesi": "Reducing helicopter rotor power requirements is of much interest in terms of payload, ceiling altitude, maximum speed and maximum range. Rotorcraft power reduction can be tackled using a large variety of design solutions, ranging from passive blade twist design to active on-blade devices. The present study examines power reductions achievable using two different on-blade active methods. A rotorcraft model was developed in order to realistically assess the performance improvements. A propulsive trim analysis is performed on a UH-60 type helicopter model featuring advanced rotor and fuselage geometry, rigid blades free to flap and a rigid prescribed wake.\nThe first concept, referred to as Static Extended Trailing Edge (SETE), aims at expanding the flight envelope by quasi-statically increasing the chord through the extension of a flat plate through a slit trailing edge over a section of the blade. This device used on the flight envelope boundaries for stall alleviation appears to be a better high-lift device than trailing-edge flaps or even Gurney flaps in that it results in higher lift-to-drag coefficients at high CL. Simulation results indicate that in stall-dominant conditions (high gross-weigh, altitude, sufficient available power) increases of up to 3,000 ft in the maximum altitude, 2,400 lbs in the maximum gross-weight, 26 knots in the maximum speed, and reductions up to 33.4% in the rotor power can be obtained. The blade section with the SETE mechanism was fabricated and appeared to operate well.\nThe second concept aims at reducing the rotor power requirements for a range of advance ratios \u2013 from 0 to 0.4 \u2013 using multiple spanwise-segmented Trailing Edge Flaps (TEFs). 4 TEFs located from 50% to 90% span actuated up to 2/rev with a maximum amplitude of 5 degrees are optimally deflected to reduce the total average torque. Power reductions ranging from 1.61% to 5.65% depending on airspeed and thrust levels were observed with the UH-60 non-linear twist distribution. Using a -8 degrees linear twist blade, power reductions ranging from 2.74% to 7.98% were observed. Such reductions are obtained by redistributing the lift inboard and reducing the trim controls, globally off-loading the tip of the rotor blade and reducing its drag.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4803], "author_name_tesi": "Leon, Olivier ", "last_name_ssi": "Leon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Olivier", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi", "Farhan Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor", "Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["stall alleviation", "helicopter power reduction", "TEFs", "trailing edge flaps", "extendable chord", "SETE", "flight envelope expansion", "rotor lift redistribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "UNTANGLING THE EFFECT OF MATERNAL SCHOOLING ON CHILD MORBIDITY AND MALNUTRITION IN PERU", "id": "13555jjl292", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13555", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the increase in educational opportunities in developing nations, there is a reduction of educational disparities in terms of gender.

Using secondary data analysis, this dissertation explored the mediating effect of maternal education using variables related to the mother\u2019s health knowledge, the mother\u2019s health behaviors, the woman\u2019s autonomy, violence against the woman, and an index of socioeconomic resources.

Among the pathways, the biggest indirect effect of maternal education was through the index of economic resources (0.10 SD), followed by the mother\u2019s health knowledge (0.07 SD), and the mother\u2019s health practices (0.06 SD), with the total effect of maternal education being 0.23 SD.

Their main goal is twofold: to diminish operational costs and to comply with emerging regulations and building certifications that demand a reduction in electricity and gas consumption. One type of building that presents a particular challenge is convenience stores. Normally, these stores are franchise associated spread around hundreds of miles at multiple locations and are managed from a centralized energy management office. This type of buildings are characterized by having high energy use per unit floor area as a result of a considerable amount of food service related equipment in a small footprint, including hot and cold food service areas. Additionally, the stores are constantly subject to the impact of ambient weather conditions due to significant air exchange rates as a consequence of operational practices and high customer throughput. This study presents and develops a methodology to monitor and target energy use in convenience stores using inverse energy modeling and the application of the cumulative sum graph as the main tracking tool.

There are three shifts observed in the CamDor assemblages which represent changes in the environment.

This sound production\nmechanism is identical to that of unvoiced speech sounds which are relevant to producing\nconsonants and also important for voice quality.  Traditionally in these cases, the speech\nscience community has focused on how the vocal tract geometry affects the acoustic\n\flter, and has entirely neglected the effect of the geometry of the aeroacoustic source\nspectrum. The theory of vortex sound implies that sources of aeroacoustic sound are\ncritically dependent upon the manner in which the jet flows over the wall, in terms\nof jet/wall geometry, the jet's speed, and especially the structure of the vorticity \ffield.  When the local source region aerodynamics, such as the mean jet path relative to the\nwall and the jet speed are varied, but the acoustic \ffilter is held constant, the differences in the aeroacoustic source are observable in the radiated sound.  A combined experimental and analytical study making use of this fact was performed to demonstrate that the aeroacoustic source spectrum for unvoiced speech sounds depends critically on the source\nregion geometry.  \n\nSuch an experiment was performed in a physical model with dimensions commensurate\nwith a life-size human vocal tract.  A jet was formed at a 26:1 area constriction\nin the duct, and passed over a thin tab protruding from the wall and blocking 41% of\nthe duct area.  The source region geometry was varied by locating the constriction at different transverse positions, relative to the tab.  At low frequencies, this did not change\nthe acoustic response of the duct, but did modify the manner in which the jet flowed over the tab.  Measurements of radiated sound performed at four flow speeds for each of three transverse constriction locations show distinct variations in spectral frequency content.\n\nThe aeroacoustic source spectra were estimated by inverse \ffiltering the radiated sound spectra with a transfer function measured between the source and radiated sound receiver.  Since the transfer function remained constant, the trends present in the source spectra matched those observed in the radiated sound.  A theoretical estimate of the effect of the jet path on the aeroacoustic source spectrum was made by combining the theory of vortex sound and a simplified\f jet model.  The trends of these source spectral estimates matched those observed in the measured source spectra.  All of the distinct differences between each constriction case and flow rate are clearly explained by the theory of vortex sound, whereas the traditional speech science approach, which assumes a flat, bandwidth-limited white noise spectrum would not have been able to predict the\npresented results.\n\nThe notion that the turbulent jet's path makes a crucial contribution to the \"shape\" of\nthe source spectrum was verified\f, and an increase in the jet's speed displayed an increase\nin the source spectrum's energy, especially at higher frequencies.  It is concluded that\nunvoiced speech sound production depends as much on the local details of the source region aerodynamics and geometry as it does on the acoustic filter.  This result implies that accurate modeling of speech sound production must incorporate details of the source region geometry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1415], "author_name_tesi": "Leonard, Daniel Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Leonard", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael H Krane", "Michael H Krane", "Dennis K Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael H Krane, Thesis Advisor", "Michael H Krane, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis K Mclaughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["unvoiced", "turbulent jet", "vortex", "speech", "acoustics", "aeroacoustics", "sound", "source spectrum"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Computation and Analysis of Cavitating Flow in Francis-class Hydraulic Turbines", "id": "24845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydropower is the most proven renewable energy technology, supplying the world with 16% of its electricity.  Conventional hydropower generates a vast majority of that percentage.  Although a mature technology, hydroelectric generation shows great promise for expansion through new dams and plants in developing hydro countries.  Moreover, in developed hydro countries, such as the United States, installing generating units in existing dams and the modern refurbishment of existing plants can greatly expand generating capabilities with little to no further impact on the environment.  In addition, modern computational technology and fluid dynamics expertise has led to substantial improvements in modern turbine design and performance.  \n\nCavitation has always presented a problem in hydroturbines, causing performance breakdown, erosion, damage, vibration, and noise.  While modern turbines are usually designed to be cavitation-free at their best efficiency point, due to the variable demand of the energy market it is fairly common to operate at off-design conditions.  Here, cavitation and its deleterious effects are unavoidable, and hence, cavitation is a limiting factor on the design and operation of these turbines.  Multiphase Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used in recent years to model cavitating flow for a large range of problems, including turbomachinery.  However, CFD of cavitating flow in hydroturbines is still in its infancy.  \n\nThis dissertation presents steady-periodic Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of a cavitating Francis-class hydroturbine at model and prototype scales.  Computational results of the reduced-scale model and full-scale prototype, undergoing performance breakdown, are compared with empirical model data and prototype performance estimations based on standard industry scalings from the model data.  Mesh convergence of the simulations is also displayed.  Comparisons are made between the scales to display that cavitation performance breakdown can occur more abruptly in the model than the prototype, due to lack of Froude similitude between the two.  When severe cavitation occurs, clear differences are observed in vapor content between the scales.  A stage-by-stage performance decomposition is conducted to analyze the losses within individual components of each scale of the machine.  As cavitation becomes more severe, the losses in the draft tube account for an increasing amount of the total losses in the machine.  More losses occur in the model draft tube as cavitation formation in the prototype draft tube is prevented by the larger hydrostatic pressure gradient across the machine.  \n\nAdditionally, unsteady Detached Eddy Simulations of the fully-coupled cavitating hydroturbine are performed for both scales.  Both mesh and temporal convergence studies are provided.  The temporal and spectral content of fluctuations in torque and pressure are monitored and compared between single-phase, cavitating, model, and prototype cases.  A shallow draft tube induced runner imbalance results in an asymmetric vapor distribution about the runner, leading to more extensive growth and collapse of vapor on any individual blade as it undergoes a revolution.  Unique frequency components manifest and persist through the entire machine only when cavitation is present in the hub vortex.  Large maximum pressure spikes, which result from vapor collapse, are observed on the blade surfaces in the multiphase simulations, and these may be a potential source of cavitation damage and erosion.     \n\nMultiphase CFD is shown to be an accurate and effective technique for simulating and analyzing cavitating flow in Francis-class hydraulic turbines.  It is recommended that it be used as an industrial tool to supplement model cavitation experiments for all types of hydraulic turbines.  Moreover, multiphase CFD can be equally effective as a research tool, to investigate mechanisms of cavitating hydraulic turbines that are not understood, and to uncover unique new phenomena which are currently unknown.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10588], "author_name_tesi": "Leonard, Daniel Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Leonard", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Miller", "Scott Miller", "Jules Washington Lindau V", "Francesco Costanzo", "Jonathan S Pitt", "John Michael Cimbala", "Brent A Craven"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Miller, Committee Chair", "Jules Washington Lindau V, Special Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Jonathan S Pitt, Committee Member", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member", "Brent A Craven, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CFD", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Multiphase", "Cavitation", "Hydroturbine", "RANS", "DES", "Performance Breakdown", "Francis turbine"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Explaining Violence in African Civil Wars: Sierra Leone and Liberia in Comparative Perspective", "id": "14797ejl196", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14797", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation I explain the variation of types of violence in African civil wars and ask why some groups use strategies of violence against civilians and sexual violence, while others deliberately avoid targeting civilians in any way.

Purpose: To prospectively examine the extent to which pre-pregnancy weight status, postpartum weight retention, and postpartum psychobehavioral variables (i.e., depression, stress, self-esteem, social support, and exercise) in early postpartum (i.e., 6-, 12- and 18-months) were associated with and explained depression and stress in later postpartum (i.e., 12-, 18- and 24-months) within a cohort of first-time mothers who were prospectively followed from 6- to 24-months postpartum. Methods: Women (N = 903) were categorized by their pre-pregnancy weight (i.e., normal weight vs. overweight/obese) and postpartum weight retention (i.e., low vs. high at 6-months) status. Women prospectively reported depressive symptoms, stress, self-esteem, social support, and exercise at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months postpartum via telephone interviews. Results: Lower early (i.e., 6-, 12-, and 18-months) postpartum social support and self-esteem and higher depression and stress were associated with higher later (i.e., 12-, 18-, and 24-months) postpartum depression and stress. Lower early (i.e., 6- and 18-months) postpartum exercise was associated with higher later (i.e., 12- and 24-months) postpartum depression and stress among overweight/obese women with low 6-month postpartum weight retention. Normal weight women with low 6-month postpartum weight retention reported: (1) significantly lower 12-month postpartum depression, and 18- and 24-month postpartum stress compared to normal weight women with higher 6-month postpartum weight retention, (2) significantly higher 12-month postpartum exercise compared to overweight/obese women with low 6-month postpartum weight retention, and (3) higher 18-month postpartum self-esteem compared to overweight/obese women with high 6-month postpartum weight retention. Among all categories of women, early (i.e., 6-, 12-, and 18-months) postpartum depression mediated the relationship between early postpartum stress, self-esteem, and social support and later (i.e., 12-, 18-, and 24-months) postpartum depression. Also, early postpartum stress mediated the relationship between early postpartum depression, self-esteem, and social support and later postpartum stress. Conclusion: Women may experience postpartum psychobehavioral constructs differently based on their pre-pregnancy weight and 6-month postpartum weight retention status. However, among all women and regardless of weight status, poorer psychobehavioral constructs lead to early postpartum depression and stress, and in turn, a continued trajectory of postpartum depression and stress as far out as 24-months postpartum. Intervention efforts are warranted during pregnancy or earlier postpartum to increase self-esteem, strengthen social support, and managing early postpartum depressive and stress symptoms in an effort to prevent a long-term trajectory of postpartum depression and stress and directly improve maternal (and therefore indirectly infant) health and well-being.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15184], "author_name_tesi": "Leonard, Krista Sue", "last_name_ssi": "Leonard", "middle_name_ssi": "Sue", "first_name_ssi": "Krista", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs", "Blair Evans", "Kristen H.

The expert system provides modelers with access to hydrological data and model results that scale from hill-slopes to major-river basins anywhere in the continental US. HydroTerre consists of three processes:\n\n\u2022 Data workflows that automate the functionality of collecting and processing essential variables for hydrological models anywhere in the US.\n\u2022 Model workflows that consume the data processes and automatically scale and transform the data into model inputs and generate efficient Penn State Integrated Hydrological Models (PIHM).\n\u2022 Visual analytic workflows that disseminate the PIHM model process results appropriately per scale and make it feasible for modelers to analyze both the data and model results, finding new features and details otherwise not possible. \n\nThe expert system, collectively, captures the critical thinking made by the hydrological modelers via the user interface, using provenance datasets that are shared amongst the modeling community. The expert system has been evaluated at the level HUC-12 catchment scale everywhere in the Continental United States of America (CONUS) with all three workflows. Chapter 2 demonstrates data workflows that provide data bundles of elevation, soil, geology, land cover, and one climate normal (30 years) of forcing data within minutes anywhere in the CONUS using distributed compute resources and High Performance Computing (HPC). The data bundles use federal national data products that would normally take a modeler days to weeks to retrieve using existing national cyber-infrastructure from these agencies.\n\nData to model workflows transform these data bundles into PIHM inputs and with HPC resources distributes PIHM model workflows dynamically as shown in Chapter 3. These transformations were evaluated millions of times to create database repositories (provenance) for modelers to conduct, share, and reproduce model studies. Additionally, these model results (poor and good) help identify opportunities to improve data and model processes at the level HUC-12 before scaling towards major river basins.\n\nThe analysis of model workflows using HPC and web based visual analytic applications is shown in Chapter 4 to explain provenance, reproducibility, and scalability for all three processes at the HUC-12 scale. Using the HydroTerre expert system, it is feasible at the HUC-12 scale to select a catchment via a web application, define model parameters, and retrieve data, model, and visualization results within minutes using distributed computing and HPC environments. The expert user can achieve these modeling steps entirely online without handling data or model arrangements. Hence, HydroTerre increases reproducibility, provenance, and a modeler\u2019s ability to create hydrologically correct models.\n\nThe focus of Chapter 5 is to identify issues learned from hill-slope modeling using HydroTerre workflows that future research will be required to address, in order to generate hydrologically correct models anywhere in the CONUS at any catchment scale. From the millions of workflows evaluated, missing data, in particular soils, requires new strategies to either replace or find suitable values. The remaining data issue is stream delineation techniques. Both the use of national data products and TauDEM strategies require new visual analytical applications to guide the expert user to correct stream data. To scale both model and visual analytic workflows requires new data structures and domain decomposition strategies that scale both catchment, cyber-infrastructure, and capability of HPC environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11284], "author_name_tesi": "Leonard, Lorne Neil", "last_name_ssi": "Leonard", "middle_name_ssi": "Neil", "first_name_ssi": "Lorne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy", "Xiaofeng Liu", "Alfonso Ignacio Mejia", "Alan Maceachren", "Kamesh Madduri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Xiaofeng Liu, Committee Member", "Alfonso Ignacio Mejia, Committee Member", "Alan Maceachren, Special Member", "Kamesh Madduri, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data Workflows", "Model Workflows", "Visual Analytic Workflows", "Distributed Hydrological Model", "Provenance", "Reproducibility", "PIHM"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "RQL Combustor Dilution Hole Placement and its Effect on the Turbine Inlet Flowfield", "id": "28681", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12445", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dilution jets in a gas turbine combustor are used to oxidize remaining fuel from the main flame zone in the combustor, and to homogenize the temperature field upstream of the turbine section through highly turbulent mixing.

Traditionally, combustor exit flowfield profiles have been obtained without the presence of vanes, and turbine inlet conditions have generally been simulated by the use of artificial turbulence generators (bar grids). Little work has been done to capture the details of the impact of the combustor\u2019s turbulent flowfield on the turbine vane in a combined configuration.

A pipeline network system could range from a simple to very sophisticated and complex arrangement: from a single pipe transporting fluid from a place to another or elaborated as an interconnected set of fluid networks for intra-state or international transportation. As the complexity of the network system grows, the solution for the network model complicates further. For a natural gas network system, the resulting set of fluid flow governing equations is highly non-linear. In such situations, the customary method employed for the solution of a set of non-linear equations is the multivariable Newton-Raphson method despite its potentially negative drawbacks. Newton-Raphson solution protocols demand a good initialization (i.e., a good initial \u201cguess\u201d of the actual solution) for satisfactory performance because convergence is only guaranteed to occur within a potentially narrow neighborhood around the solution vector. This prerequisite can become fairly restrictive for the solution of large gas network systems, where estimations of \u201cgood\u201d initial gas load and nodal values across the domain can defy intuition. In addition, some Newton-Raphson formulations require pre-defining flow loops within a network system prior to attempting a solution, which proves to be a challenging task in an extensive network. An alternate, simple yet elegant method to address the aforementioned problems is proposed. The proposed solution methodology retains most advantages of the Newton-nodal method while removing the need for initial guesses and eliminating the need for expensive Jacobian formulations and associated derivative calculations. The resulting linear-pressure analog model is robust, reliable and its execution and convergence is independent of user-defined initial guesses for nodal pressures and flow rates.

Similarly, even qualitative measurements may be hindered due to ionization enhancement or suppression as an effect of the local chemical environment.  The use of laser post-ionization (LPI) for the ionization of sputtered neutrals enables SIMS ionization mechanisms to be decoupled from the sputtering event.\nThe LPI scheme used in this research utilizes an ultra-short pulse of high power laser radiation in the infra-red region to photoionize sputtered neutral molecules which have been released from the sample\u2019s surface following primary ion bombardment.  In this process, the SIMS sputtering event is decoupled from the SIMS ionization event.

These models have been used to determine many tire properties and tire-road interaction parameters which are either prohibitively expensive or unavailable with physical models. More recently, computerized modeling has been used to explore tire-soil interactions. The new parameters created by these interactions were defined for these models, but accurate soil constitutive equations were lacking. With the previous models, the soil was simulated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with soil material models requiring calibration and validation. Furthermore, the meshless modeling method of Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) may be a viable approach to more accurately simulating large soil deformations and complex tire-soil interactions.\n\nFor this thesis, a rigid tire model is used to perform an extensive sensitivity study on the previously used FEA soft soil (dense sand) in order to determine the importance of mesh size, soil plot size, and edge constraints. Then, parameters for SPH particles are determined for either complete or partial replacement of FEA elements in the soil model. Rolling resistance tests are conducted with a rigid tire model for different SPH and FEA/SPH soil models and compared to the previously determined best FEA soil model. Replacement of FEA elements with SPH particles is found to be the key variable as using a deeper amount of SPH particles increases rolling resistance while increasing the SPH particle density has little effect on rolling resistance. These results are then replicated using a pneumatic tire model. \n\nFor further validation, pressure-sinkage tests are conducted with the FEA and SPH soils to explore the differences in the two soil modeling methods. Also, shear-displacement tests are conducted with the SPH soil\u2014a test which cannot easily be performed with an FEA soil model. These shear tests show that the SPH soil behaves more like a clay in initial shearing and more like a sand by exhibiting increased shearing due to vertical loading. Furthermore, both the pressure-sinkage and shear-displacement tests still indicate that a larger particle density is unnecessary.&#8195;\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5175], "author_name_tesi": "Lescoe, Ryan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lescoe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moustafa El Gindy", "Moustafa El Gindy", "Kevin L Koudela"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moustafa El Gindy, Thesis Advisor", "Moustafa El Gindy, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin L Koudela, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["smoothed", "smooth particle hydrodynamics", "FEA", "finite element analysis", "tire-soil interaction", "soil modeling", "SPH", "PAM-Crash", "PAM-Shock", "pneumatic tire", "rigid tire"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Structural Health Monitoring of a Shell Structure Using Piezoelectric Fiber Composite Strip Transducers", "id": "22500", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10047", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Structural health monitoring (SHM) is an emerging technology that aims to transition traditional schedule-based maintenance to a more efficient need-based maintenance paradigm. The goal of this technology is to deploy an autonomous system that continuously monitors the state of a structure that can identify, locate, and size damage.

Maintenance personnel can use the SHM information to replace individual parts when needed versus when a predefined schedule says they need to be replaced.

Guided Waves have the ability to efficiently inspect entire structures and carry information that, when properly extracted, describes the structural state. A new type of transducer has recently been developed to excite planar Lamb waves in shell structures for SHM applications. These new piezoelectric fiber composite (PFC) transducers are both flexible and more controllable than conventional Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) transducers. This makes PFC transducers more suitable for permanent deployment on shell structures where health monitoring is important.

Four tests were conducted in total for three different damage states. Baseline and damage waveforms were collected from each operating, environmental, and structure state. The waveforms were analyzed in both the time and frequency domains from both sets of arrays.

Our approach differed from other transgenic non-target studies by emphasizing species-level identification of a functionally diverse subset of the epigeal insect community, notably Coleoptera, with extensive analysis of Carabidae, to maximize the biological and functional resolution of the data.  We examined population dynamics as well as community response using current statistical approaches in the fields of biodiversity sciences and community ecology.\nInsecticide inputs were lower in transgenic crops due to the efficient control of important pest taxa, which served to sustain epigeal biodiversity.  In maize agroecosystems, no differences were found between the coleopteran communities in conventional and transgenic insect control practices where transgenic field corn contained a neonicotinoid seed treatment.  Both management tactics negatively influenced coleopeteran communities compared to a control.  Dominant members of the carabid community exhibited temporal partitioning of resources.  One species, Harpalus pensylvanicus, consistently exhibited higher activity-densities in the control fields, and was identified as a possible bio-indicator.  Despite management influences, differences between crop species and the effect of crop rotations was often sufficient to mask any treatment effects.\nCarabid communities were significantly different between maize and a forested field margin, and shifts in community structure along a transect were most rapid at the grassy margin between the two habitats.  Carabidae communities were more diverse in the forest edge, where plant diversity was also highest.  Despite strong habitat associations, most abundant carabids were found in both forest and maize.  Differences between carabid communities in maize fields at varying distances from a forested margin suggested landscape level influences.

Rumen sampling areas (n = 9) included the caudal dorsal blind sac, cranial dorsal sac, cranial ventral sac, and the caudal and ventral portions of the caudal ventral blind sac.  Right and left sides of the rumen were sampled.  Five 1-cm2 sections were removed from each area and measured for papillae length (n = 20/area), papillae width (n = 20/area), rumen wall thickness (n = 5/area), and number of papillae per cm2 (n = 5/area).  Correlations between areas, samples, and measurements were obtained, and comparisons between experiments, areas, samples, and measurements were performed for all variables.  In addition, power analyses were conducted for all variables to determine the efficacy of the procedure in detecting treatment differences.  Results indicate that samples should be taken from the caudal and cranial sacs of the dorsal and ventral rumen to sufficiently represent papillae growth and development throughout the entire rumen.  The procedure is capable of detecting treatment differences for papillae length and papillae width, has a decreased but acceptable capability of detecting treatment differences for rumen wall thickness, but appears limited in ability to detect treatment differences for papillae per cm2.

A subset of 6 male calves (3/treatment) was euthanized at 4 wk of age and rumen tissue sampled for rumen epithelial growth measurements.  Starter sugar content was significantly increased in the starter containing extra molasses.  Post-weaning and overall starter dry matter intake, overall total dry matter intake, daily heart girth change, and final heart girth were significantly decreased while overall average daily gain tended to decrease when calves received starter containing 12% molasses.  However, blood volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly increased when calves received a starter containing 12% molasses.  No significant differences were observed between calves receiving starters containing 5 or 12% molasses for all other variables.  The data indicates that adding extra molasses to a texturized calf starter decreases intake and structural growth, possibly causing decreased weight gain, but increases blood volatile fatty acid concentrations and slightly increases rumen development.  However, feed handling and physical prehension problems in addition to the negative influences on calf growth and intake do not support increasing starter molasses content to 12% of the ration.\n\n\nNeonatal Holstein calves were fed texturized calf starters containing 33% whole, dry-rolled, roasted-rolled, or steam-flaked corn to investigate how altering the corn processing method affects intake, growth, rumen and blood metabolites, and rumen development.  In experiment 1Ninety-two Holstein calves (52 male and 40 female) were started at 2 \u00b1 1 d of age and studied for 42 days.  Starter dry matter intake was measured and fecal scoring conducted daily.  Growth and blood parameter measurements were conducted weekly.  A subset of 12 male calves (3/treatment) was euthanized at 4 wk of age and rumen tissue sampled for rumen epithelial development measurements.  Experiment 2 consisted of 12 male Holstein calves ruminally cannulated at 7 \u00b1 1 d of age.  Rumen fluid and blood samples were collected at multiple time points over a 22 h period during weeks 2 to 6.  In the first experiment, post-weaning and overall starter and total dry mater intake was significantly higher in calves fed starter with dry-rolled corn than in calves fed starter with roasted-rolled or steam flaked corn.  Post-weaning and overall starter and overall total dry matter intake was significantly higher in calves fed starter with whole corn than in calves fed starter with steam-flaked corn.  Post-weaning average daily gain was significantly greater in calves fed starter with dry-rolled corn than in calves fed starter with steam-flaked corn.  Daily structural growth was greatest in calves receiving starter with roasted-rolled corn.  Blood volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly higher in calves fed starter with steam-flaked corn than in calves fed all other treatments.  Papillae length and rumen wall thickness was significantly greater in calves fed starter with steam-flaked corn than in calves fed starter with dry-rolled and whole corn, respectively.  In experiment 2, calves fed starter with whole corn had higher rumen pH and lower rumen volatile fatty acid concentrations than calves fed all other starters.  Rumen propionate production was increased in calves receiving starter with steam-flaked corn, however, rumen butyrate production was higher in calves fed starter with roasted-rolled corn.  Results from the current study indicate that the type of processed corn incorporated into calf starter can influence intake, growth, and rumen parameters in neonatal calves.  Calves consuming starter containing roasted-rolled corn had similar body weight, feed efficiency, and rumen development but increased structural growth and ruminal butyrate production when compared to the other three corn processing treatments.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3383], "author_name_tesi": "Lesmeister, Keith Eric", "last_name_ssi": "Lesmeister", "middle_name_ssi": "Eric", "first_name_ssi": "Keith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Gabriella Anne Varga", "Peter R Tozer", "Lester C Griel Jr.", "Harold William Harpster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member", "Peter R Tozer, Committee Member", "Lester C Griel Jr., Committee Member", "Harold William Harpster, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rumen development", "dairy calves", "yeast culture", "molasses", "starch availability"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Monitoring Human Trafficking in Displaced Populations", "id": "21347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9937", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When people hear the word \u201cslavery,\u201d it conjures images of a terrible scourge on human history.

In the Gulf of Mexico, habitat-modifying fauna frequently dominate cold seep communities.  Examples of these fauna include large aggregations of mussels and tubeworms as well as mobile animals such as burrowing spatangoid urchins.  As seepage declines, cold-water corals settle on authigenic carbonate rock and eventually form large, long-lasting coral reefs that support diverse coral-associated fauna.  In this dissertation, physical collections and non-destructive sampling tools such as image and GIS analyses were used to characterize newly discovered cold seep and coral communities as well as examine the mechanisms that influence the ecology of deep seeps.  Chapters 2 and 3 examine interspecific interactions and habitat provision and modification by different foundation fauna, such as tubeworms, mussels and corals, which harbor unique communities.  These fauna are long-lived, and have generally predictable successional trends that are similar to shallower seeps in the Gulf of Mexico.  However, I also show that exceptions to these trends occur when small changes in seepage expression over time influence the recruitment and growth of the foundation fauna.  In Chapter 4, I characterize a newly discovered type of seep community dominated by spatangoid urchins (Sarsiaster griegii), and provide evidence for the role of interspecific interactions as a strong influence on the community ecology of seep sediment infauna.  I demonstrate that urchins act as habitat-modifying fauna whose activities influence sediment infauna community composition and structure, and contribute to high spatial heterogeneity in deep seep sediments.  In these seep communities, the dominant megafauna influence the composition, structure, abundance and diversity of the associated community as a result of their physical structure, which provides a habitat resource and as a result of their activities.  Facilitative interspecific interactions, particularly between habitat-modifying fauna and their associated communities, strongly contribute to the general patterns in the community ecology observed in these seep environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5476], "author_name_tesi": "Lessard-Pilon, Stephanie Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Lessard-Pilon", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Denice Heller Wardrop", "Iliana Brigitta Baums", "Alexander Klippel", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Committee Member", "Iliana Brigitta Baums, Committee Member", "Alexander Klippel, Committee Member", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["urchin", "deep sea", "image analysis", "GIS", "coral", "Gulf of Mexico", "community ecology", "cold seep", "meiofauna"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF CONSUMER RETURNS ON\nMANUFACTURER\u2019S INVESTMENTS, RETURNS\nPOLICIES AND SALES CHANNEL DESIGN", "id": "15109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7530", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many companies consider the flow of consumer returns to be a nuisance and a source\nof reduced profits. Returns of products to the point of sale are continuously increasing\nand the costs associated with acquiring, shipping, inspecting, refurbishing, and\nremarketing returned products can reach unsustainable levels for both manufacturers\nand retailers. Further, the majority of products are returned not because of product\nfailure but rather because of a mismatch with consumer taste and needs, which suggests\nthat there are several countermeasures that can be taken to reduce the flow of\nreturns.\nIn this work we take the prospective of a manufacturer and investigate how the\nmanufacturer can reduce the negative impact of returns on his profits through investments,\nreturns policies, and design of the sales channel. Investments to discourage\nconsumers from returning the product are relevant because most of the products are\nreturned not for reasons of product performance or quality but for difficulty in the\ninstallation, configuration, and use of the product. The examples of manufacturers,\nwho are active in providing simple and easy to follow instructions and in making\ntheir products more intuitive to use, abound. Returns policies adopted by manufacturers\nwith their retailers are an ideal instrument to induce retailer\u2019s collaboration in\nproduct value recovery. Especially for products that are time-sensitive in nature, it\nis necessary that retailers actively engage in inspecting and refurbishing the returned\nproducts rather than sending them back to the manufacturer. Finally, through an\noptimal design of the sales channel, the manufacturer can attract consumers towards\nthe sales channel where returns have a lower impact on the manufacturer\u2019s profits.\nWhile the online channel allows the manufacturer to provide consumers with a higher\nproduct value, for instance through product variety, availability, and customization, it poses the problem of uncertainty about product fit, which may trigger a product\nreturn. Investments, returns policies, and sales channel design are then three important\ntools for manufacturers to alleviate the negative impact of consumer returns on\ntheir profits. This work is articulated in four chapters and proposes practical rules\nfor manufacturers to cope more efficiently with the problem of consumer returns.\nChapter 1 contains an introduction to the problem of consumer returns and gives\na thorough review of the following three chapters.\nChapter 2 considers the problem of a manufacturer who is interested in having\nthe retailer repackage and resell the products rather than send the products back\nto him. The manufacturer may take a costly hidden action to reduce the expected\nnumber of products returned by the consumer, but the returned products are privately\nobserved by the retailer who has little incentive to engage in product recovery. We\nfind that to discourage returns from the retailer the manufacturer should design an\noptimal returns policy which entails a full refund of the wholesale price for any returns,\ncoupled with a bonus that is decreasing in the number of returns to the manufacturer.\nChapter 3 considers the inefficiencies in the product value recovery due to information\nasymmetry along the supply chain. We consider a manufacturer who faces\nconsumer returns at his retail store and has to decide about a preventative investment\nbefore the new selling season starts, when the causes of returns are still uncertain. By\nthe beginning of the selling season, the information about the causes of returns and\nthus about the effectiveness of the previous investment in reducing returns can be\nupdated. We investigate how profits and investment are affected by the information\nheld by retailer and manufacturer about the future product return rate. It is showed\nthat when there is no or an asymmetric update of information about the product\nreturn rate, the manufacturer might opt for a less efficient product value recovery\nand, in some cases, he would forgo investing in the first place.\nFinally, Chapter 4 considers the problem of the manufacturer to select the sales\nchannel for his products. Through an online channel the manufacturer can offer higher product value to the consumer than through the traditional retail channel, mainly\nbecause of product variety, availability and customization. However, there might\nbe uncertainty about product fit and the manufacturer has to strategically control,\nthrough prices and a returns policy, the flow of consumers buying his product through\nthe on-line channel vs. the retail channel. We find that when consumers prefer\npurchasing at the retail store, the manufacturer might decide to open anyway an\nonline channel but just to induce the retailer to lower the selling price, thus boosting\nmanufacturer\u2019s demand and profits. When the salvage value that can be extracted\nfrom returns is sufficiently high, the manufacturer offers his products through both the retail and the online channel. Further, the manufacturer will adopt a liberal returns\npolicy because in this way he can lead some of the consumers to switch towards an online purchase, which would alleviate the inefficiencies due to double marginalization\noccurring at the retail channel.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7467], "author_name_tesi": "Letizia, Paolo ", "last_name_ssi": "Letizia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paolo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Paul Harrison", "Terry Paul Harrison", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Keith John Crocker", "Douglas J Thomas", "Susan H Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Paul Harrison, Dissertation Advisor", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Keith John Crocker, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["consumer returns", "returns policies", "product recovery", "preponement", "hidden action", "hidden information"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Critical Issues of Complex, Epitaxial Oxide Growth and Integration with Silicon by Molecular Beam Epitaxy", "id": "5994", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Molecular beam epitaxy was used to grow epitaxial oxides on silicon substrates using a systematic approach beginning with an understanding of system oxidation kinetics and thermodynamics and involving a strategy of moving from simple binary oxides to more complex structures.  The growth of BaO, SrO, EuO, and SrTiO3 are discussed with a focus on the general theme of integration of functional, epitaxial oxides into a silicon environment.\n\nOxidation studies of various metal systems relevant for oxide on silicon epitaxy and integration are reported.  Experimental results demonstrate dramatically different oxidation behavior depending on elemental species and the catalytic nature of an alkaline earth metal at small doping concentrations to enable the full oxidation of the poorly oxidizing metals at oxygen pressures significantly lower than during deposition of the pure metal alone.  Results from the deposition of Sr, Ba, Ti, La, Eu, Gd, and Al and codeposited combinations of the various elements are presented.\n\nThe critical aspects of the growth of alkaline earth oxides on silicon are explained in detail.  The step by step transition from the silicon to the alkaline earth oxide mediated by the formation of an interfacial silicide layer as described through reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) is presented and used as a means to understand issues related to interface stability, oxidation, structural, and strain considerations for each stage of the growth.  High quality, commensurate alkaline earth oxides (BaO, SrO, and (Ba,Sr)O) are grown on silicon at room temperature and PO2 background ~ 3 \u00a5 10-8 Torr, taking advantage of the favorable oxidation kinetics of the alkaline earth metals and anomalously low temperatures necessary for epitaxial growth.\n\nThe growth of alkaline earth oxide and rare earth earth oxide solid solutions and rare earth oxides (EuO) are described.  RHEED data demonstrates the ability to create metastable solid solutions.  The first reported epitaxial EuO (a silicon compatible ferromagnet) on silicon is reported, enabled by the use of a thin buffer layer (13 \u00c5) of SrO.  X-ray diffraction and RHEED data indicate single phase, single domain films with tremendous potential for spintronics applications.\n\nUsing a strategy of transition from simple structures to the more complex, the growth of a perovskite (SrTiO3) on silicon is demonstated.  Growth of a structurally optimized perovskite structure entails the transformation of a thin interfacial alkaline earth oxide layer into the initial perovskite cells.  Such a transformation is facilitated by the strong tendency of the system to form the equilibrium structure under silicon friendly growth conditions (low temperature and low oxidant pressure).  Optimized SrTiO3 and La-doped SrTiO3 on silicon are used to integrate a piezoelectric relevant for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications and a ferroelectric relevant for a ferroelectric random access memory (FRAM) architecture.  A d33 (piezoelectric coefficient) value of over 400 pm/V under bias is measured for the piezoelectric (Pb(Mn1/3Nb2/3)O3 \u2013 PbTiO3) and a remanent polarization of 25 mC/cm2 and fatigue free behavior (>1012 cycles) for a low temperature (450 \u00b0C) deposited ferroelectric (Pb(Zr,Ti)O3) is obtained.\n\nInitial work concerning the growth of even more complex structures such as conducting and ferroelectric superlattices are described.  Short period superlattices of LaTiO3 and SrTiO3 are successfully grown on silicon with a high degree of crystalline quality.

By collecting DNA from the Holocene epoch (10 kya to present), I investigate fine-scale responses of North American bison to the onset of an interglacial climate and illustrate that known environmental and anthropogenic events could be tied to the decline and extinction of the steppe bison. I provide the first evidence of bison migration northward through the ice-free corridor that was in northwestern Canada. I investigate the temporal genetic stability of caribou populations living in the Northwest Territories, Canada throughout the past 3,800 years to test if they were affected by a volcanic eruption ~1.1 kya and assess the genetic support for the subspecific identification of caribou ecotypes. In the first paleogenetic analysis of armadillos, I illustrate that North American fossils assigned to Dasypus bellus (the beautiful armadillo) genetically assign to two species, one of which likely represents the ancestor of the modern nine-banded armadillo. Finally, historic and modern DNA is used to determine the phylogeny of the steamer ducks of South America and hypothesize how past glacial environmental changes may have shaped their current genetic diversity and distribution.

Anaerobic digesters, which convert methane into energy in the form of electricity, natural gas, or heat, are one such technology.  Previous economic research has shown that subsidies are required for most farms to adopt this technology profitably. However, that research has not fully addressed issues related to carbon credit trading, net metering laws, and possible jumps, positive or negative, in the value of digesters. \n\n\nCarbon credits and net metering are two benefits a farmer may receive for implementing a digester.  In some cases, farmers are eligible to receive carbon credits, which have a monetary benefit, when operating an anaerobic digester.  Net metering laws effectively modify the costs and returns associated with electricity generation.  Before these laws, farmers often received a bill from the electric company each month, even though they were generating their own electricity.\n\n\nThis research employs a real options approach with multiple jump diffusion processes to address the issue in light of these mitigating factors.  Real options analysis is superior to net present value (NPV) calculations because it takes into account the uncertainty associated with the investment as well as the fact that most investments are at least partially irreversible.  That is they exhibit sunk costs, which cannot be recovered once the investment has been made.\n\n\nA jump is defined as any sudden shock to an asset\u2019s value that causes the value to change by more than the market\u2019s usual variation.  It is important to include jumps in this model because asset values follow a jump diffusion process if market shocks occur.  I define changes in policy or improvements to technology as the jumps that could affect a digester\u2019s value.  A jump may or may not occur in a given time period.  The size of the jump also varies and small jumps are more likely than large jumps.   \n\n\nIn this setting, the value of the underlying asset follows Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) in the absence of a jump.  When jumps are present, the value follows both GBM and the jump.  My research represents a modification of a model developed by Martzoukos and Trigeorgis (2002), which allowed them to implement jumps of multiple types.  Additionally, I employ Monte Carlo simulation techniques to simulate paths throughout the state space, resulting in a distribution of option values. \n\n\nI use the modified methodology to value European and American call options.  These represent the value of the option to purchase a digester and solids separator at the end of a five-year period, in the European option case, or during this time period, in the American option case.  I analyzed two different dairy herd sizes, 1,000 and 2,000 cows. \n\n\nFor those farms that have a digester without a solids separator, the American option values for a 1,000- and 2,000-cow herd are $35,000 and $108,400, respectively, when carbon credits and net metering are included. These American option values increase to $109,300 and $318,700, respectively, for herd sizes of 1,000 and 2,000 cows when the farm sells solids as compost.  If the same farms use the separated solids as bedding material, the option values increase to $257,900 and $715,300.  These results are sensitive to the price the farm receives for electricity sales and the initial capital cost of the digester.  Carbon credit prices and composting costs have little effect on the option values.\n\n\nThe inclusion of jumps as well as parameters of the jumps also have an effect on option values.  Without jumps, European option values for 1,000-cow farms that use the solids for bedding are $76,000, compared to $257,900 when jumps are included in the model.  This indicates that these jumps positively affect option values.  The results were also sensitive to the time to maturity, standard deviation of a jump, mean jump size, and jump frequency.  An increase in the time to maturity, standard deviation of a jump, and jump frequency increased the option value, while increasing the mean jump size decreased the option value.   \n\n\nThese results suggest that the option to invest increases in value with herd size and the addition of a solids separator, particularly when the farm uses the solids as bedding.  The price the farm receives for selling excess electricity also affects the option value.  Option values increase with the inclusion of net metering and carbon credit trading.  This suggests that some policies and programs increase the expected profitability of anaerobic digesters and, consequently, may increase farm-level adoption.  Adding jumps to the model provides a more accurate picture of option value because they incorporate the uncertainty of market shocks.  Values for the jump parameters were difficult to estimate.  Because sensitivity analysis indicates that option values are extremely sensitive to jump parameter values, additional research to parameterize the jumps is necessary.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1828], "author_name_tesi": "Leuer, Elizabeth R.", "last_name_ssi": "Leuer", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hyde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hyde, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["anaerobic digesters", "real options analysis", "jump processes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Emergent Monoclinic Phase in KNbO3 Discovered Using Optical Second Harmonic Generation", "id": "16476", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8248", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Potassium Niobate (KNbO3) is a ferroelectric material with a perovskite structure that exhibits the same types of phase transitions as BaTiO3.

This thesis explores the fundamental factors that would limit the high field and reliability performance in thin layer dielectrics based on BaTiO3. Those factors have different origins: On one side, the nature of the metal-dielectric interface was shown to affect the high field dielectric properties of capacitive structures. In addition to that, the intrinsic bulk properties of BaTiO3 based solid solutions affect the high field properties of thin dielectric layers depending on composition and annealing conditions. Both effects were investigated in this study.\nThe temperature dependence of the electrical leakage current density of chemical solution deposited BaTiO3 films on high purity Ni foils was investigated as function of the underlying Ni microstructure. The electrical properties were then characterized on capacitors with and without the presence of Ni grain boundaries. When a Ni grain boundary from the substrate was present in the capacitor used during the electrical measurements, the loss tangent of the capacitor rose rapidly for dc biases exceeding ~25kV/cm. The critical bias increases to ~100kV/cm when no substrate grain boundaries are included in the capacitor. In addition, the capacitance-voltage curves are much more symmetric when grain boundaries are absent. This disparity in the electrical behavior was analyzed in terms of the mechanisms of charge conduction across the Ni-dielectric interface. While a reverse biased Schottky emission mechanism dominates the current in areas free of Ni grain boundaries, the Schottky barrier at the cathode is less effective when Ni grain boundaries are present due to local enhancement of the electric field. This, leads to a larger leakage current dominated by the forward biased Schottky barrier at the anode. \nIn addition to the interface influence, the stoichiometry of the BaTiO3 dielectric layer affect the dielectric properties of the capacitive structures if the composition exceeds the solubility limit at the film processing temperature. When that happens, the high voltage dielectric properties are considerable influenced by the presence of second phases. This is manifested in larger leakage currents, and increase in the dielectric losses at high temperatures and/or applied voltage.\nIn order to improve the high field electrical properties of the BaTiO3 based dielectric materials, a doping strategy with Zr was employed. A full solid solution was obtained in all the range of compositions as established by x-ray diffraction. In addition, it was shown that when Zr is added in small amounts (x<0.05) the dielectric behavior is appropriate to be used in MLCC\u2019s, meaning large permittivity, and a Curie-temperature above 85\u00b0C. In addition, small amounts of Zr also raise the band gap of the solid solution (from 2.89\u00b10.03 eV for pure BaTiO3 to 3.01\u00b10.03 eV for 2% Zr) suggesting lower electronic conductivity. The enthalpy of reduction is also significantly raised by the presence of Zr (from 5.6\u00b10.2 eV for undoped BaTiO3 to 7.3\u00b10.25 eV at 2% Zr) leading to an important reduction of the concentration of oxygen vacancies and consequently a decrease in ionic and electronic conductivity. Resistance degradation measurements in bulk as well as in thin films provide evidence that indeed the conductivity is hindered by the presence of Zr in the lattice. In the same way, thermally stimulated depolarization current measurements strongly indicate lower mobility of oxygen vacancies for samples with Zr, using these measurements a difference in an order of magnitude in the relaxation times of oxygen vacancies within a grain has been found between undoped BaTiO3 and BaZr0.05Ti0.95O3.\nBa1-xCaxTi1-yZryO3 solid solutions were also considered as dielectric materials for MLCC\u2019s since the addition of Ca to the A-site also yielded improved electrical properties. This solid solution showed enhanced properties regarding undoped BaTiO3, such as larger energy band gaps and enthalpies of reduction, with acceptable dielectric behavior. Nevertheless, when compared with BaTi1-xZrxO3, there is no added value to the addition of Ca. Conversely, the level of enhancement is similar to that of             Ba1-xCaxTiO3. Factors that may influence this behavior are been discussed such as, the chemistry interaction between cations, lattice volume, the possibility of Ca entering the B-site, contributing to the formation of oxygen vacancies, and local segregation of secondary phases.\nScientific insights into non-ideal solid solution behavior and its impact on conduction are inferred within this study. The deviation from Vegard\u2019s law in some of the physical properties may be caused by local segregation of secondary phases even if the average crystal structure behaves as a solid solution with linear variation in lattice parameter. Thus, it is suggested here that the local composition, determined by the enthalpy of mixing, should be evaluated in order to link between the physical properties and the presence of second phases. In addition, the option of incorporating other isovalent cations bigger than Ti in the B-site seems attractive to enhance insulation resistance and resistance degradation. It is believed that Hf may be a good candidate. It is also suggested to perform a comprehensive set of experiments with the purpose of evaluating the effect that the presence of Zr will have on the site occupancy of amphoteric dopants, known for enhancing degradation resistance, and ultimately on the electrical properties of the solid solutions.\nAdditionally, technological insights are gained through the solid-solution effects of Ca and Zr in this investigation to improve leakage and reliability with minimal impact on the dielectric properties. It is suggested that additional improvements can be made through the control of electrode roughness at the interface. For future dielectrics based on BaTiO3 and base metal electrodes, engineers have to consider both, the interface and improved bulk dielectric performance. For example, Zr doped BaTiO3 cores in X5R type MLCC\u2019s, this means powder companies need to manufacture Zr-doped BaTiO3 and then add doping constituents to these.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5123], "author_name_tesi": "Levi, Roni Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Levi", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Roni", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C A Randall", "C A Randall", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry", "L Q Chen", "E C Dickey", "Leslie Eric Cross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C A Randall, Dissertation Advisor", "C A Randall, Committee Chair", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry, Committee Member", "L Q Chen, Committee Member", "E C Dickey, Committee Member", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thin films", "dielectrics", "barium titanate", "solid solutions"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Bodies and Subjects in Merleau-Ponty and Foucault: Towards a Phenomenological/Poststructuralist Feminist Theory of Embodied Subjectivity\n", "id": "8186", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3192", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is about feminism, embodiment, subjectivity, and liberation from oppressed ways of bodily being.  My primary claim is that subjectivity is fundamentally embodied, and that understanding this is beneficial for feminism.  A feminist theory of embodiment must account for the lived experiences of multiple and varied embodied subjects in multiple and varied social situations, for the genealogical histories behind such embodied subjectivities, and for the possibility of their engaging in progressive, liberatory change on both a personal and a political level.  \nI approach a liberatory theory of embodiment using two traditionally divergent but in my view complimentary approaches: Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenology and Foucault\u2019s poststructuralism.  I argue that it is possible to read Merleau-Ponty\u2019s phenomenology in concert with Foucault\u2019s postmodernism by highlighting their similarities, showing that their differences are complimentary rather than contradictory, and elucidating how each provides elements that can strengthen areas that are lacking in the other.  My claim is that both figures present similar theories of subjectivity as fundamentally embodied and contextualized, yet with different foci that each provide necessary components of a complete theory: Merleau-Ponty focuses on the experiential, material aspects of embodied being in his discussions of habits, body images, and the \u201cI can\u201d, while Foucault emphasizes the power relationships and the discursive and historical forces that contribute to body-subjects\u2019 construction.  Read together, the two provide a theory of embodiment as discursive yet still material, and as historically and culturally situated, yet still capable of agentic, liberatory transformation.  \nAs an example of the application of such a theory to feminist liberatory practices, I examine the body-discipline of karate as a means of transforming oppressive, restrictive body-habits into the habits of a body-subject who is freer and more open to possibilities and pleasures.  I further show how engaging in karate (or other body disciplines) enhances the body-subject\u2019s ability to work for progressive change on a collective level.  It is my contention that combining phenomenological insights from Merleau-Ponty with poststructuralist insights from Foucault provides feminists with a thorough and robust foundation for understanding both the necessity and the possibility for such transformation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3180], "author_name_tesi": "Levin, Julia ", "last_name_ssi": "Levin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Nancy A Tuana", "John Philip Christman", "Jane Juffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Committee Chair", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Jane Juffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["merleau-ponty", "foucaul", "subjectivity", "embodiment", "feminism"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Heterogeneous Integration of III-V and II-IV Semiconductor Sheets onto Silicon Substrate through Electric-Field Assisted Assembly for Device Applications\n", "id": "27548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10917", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Market forces are creating a strong need to make value-added enhancements to silicon (Si) complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) technology. One approach to achieve this goal is through continued scaling following Moore\u2019s law. With the future of device scaling being relatively uncertain in the next 10-20 years, it is important to find new ways to add value to CMOS. Theoretical projections show that monolithic three-dimensional (3D) integration of compound semiconductor (CS) devices can enhance the performance and functionality of future CMOS-based IC\u2019s. This becomes increasingly important with continued scaling. With each new technology node the interconnect pitch is reduced, increasing the RC delay. The net result is an increase in response time between circuit components, resulting in a greater need for 3D integration to minimize the length of the contact lines between CMOS and other non-digital functionalities. To achieve this complex goal, a flexible heterogeneous integration strategy is required that can incorporate a diverse selection of materials all onto a single substrate.\nElectric-field assisted assembly is a promising technique that allows for fast, low temperature and versatile integration of a large variety of materials onto alternative substrates. In this technique, particles can be assembled from solution at high yields, achieving sub-micron alignment registration to predefined features on the substrate. The approach is not limited by mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and lattice constant, offering the flexibility to apply materials at the device layer, or any subsequent layer in the CMOS backend.\nIn this thesis research, electric-field assisted assembly of micron-sized compound semiconductor (CS) sheets is studied through a combination of experiment and finite element method (FEM) modeling. This work presents a clear picture of charge distribution within an assembled particle on the substrate, and uses the model to accurately predict the preferred assembly position. The assembly position is confirmed experimentally, demonstrating reproducible sub-micron alignment accuracy with respect to patterned features on a substrate. \nThrough a combination of electric-field assisted assembly and top down fabrication, a novel heterogeneous integration strategy is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, this technique is used to create In0.53Ga0.47As fin geometry p+-i-n+ junctions directly on Si substrates. The as-etched fin devices are not rectifying, but with annealing at 350\u00baC in N2 for 20 minutes, the electrical properties are restored. This process is further developed to implement fin tunnel field-effect transistors (TFETs) and metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) integrated on Si. While dry etch-induced damage degrades the TFET device performance, fin MOSFETs show considerably better device performance due to their majority carrier device operation. Fin MOSFETs have a subthreshold slope of 280mV/decade and an on/off ratio of ~103 at 100mV. Through technology aided computer design (TCAD) simulations, it is shown that MOSFET performance can be improved by implementing an optimized doping design.\nTo further emphasize the versatility of this heterogeneous integration strategy, solution-synthesized germanium selenide (GeSe) particles are assembled onto Si substrates. GeSe offers promise for phase change memory applications and non-toxic solar cells, due to its bandgap in the visible spectrum and use of earth-abundant non-toxic elements. GeSe nanobelts are measured both with 2-pt and 4-pt single particle measurements, and a resistivity of 360 \u03a9-cm is determined. This integration strategy is a reproducible technique for single particle measurements of solution-synthesized materials, something significantly lacking in the field. With such a technique, solution-synthesized particles can be evaluated for their use in future device applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10505], "author_name_tesi": "Levin, Scott M", "last_name_ssi": "Levin", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Roman Engel Herbert", "Suman Datta", "Timothy John Eden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Roman Engel Herbert, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["III-V semiconductors", "electric-field assisted assembly", "heterogeneous integration", "FinFET", "GeSe"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Demonstrating the versatility of the iDNA scaffold: New synthetic strategies and applications\n", "id": "10141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3706", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Biological macromolecules including DNA and enzymes have long been the inspiration for the design and construction of synthetic molecular assemblies. Biomolecules have the inherent ability to use molecular recognition to self-assemble functional architectures that are capable of complex catalytic reactions, photochemistry,and storage of information. A major aim of these studies is to develop novel inorganic supramolecular structures that have tunable magnetic, electronic, chemical and physical properties beyond naturally occurring systems.\n\nChapter 2 describes initial studies of the biological interactions between 12mer\ndsDNA and solid phase synthesized pyridyl tetrapeptides that have been reacted with\n[Pt(tpy)]2+ to create metallated single-stranded structures. These interactions were probed using ITC, UV and CD thermal denaturation experiments and show that the KB for the metallated peptide represents an affinity 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of the monometallic analogue [Pt(tpy)(pic)]2+ for the same dsDNA sequence\n\nWhile exploring applications for the solid phase peptides, the major limitation encountered was the small quantities that were afforded by the loading of functional groups on the resin. To increase the amount of material that is available for electrochemical and spectroscopic studies, the synthetic approach was modified from solid phase to solution phase. Chapter 3 describes efforts focusing on the synthesis of a pyridine functionalized dipeptide that is reacted with platinum dipyridylthiophene ([Pt(dpt)]+1) ligand to cross-link the two pyridine groups forming a monometallic dipeptide. The placement of the Pt(dpt) on the peptide scaffold allows for  potential applications as building blocks for labeling synthetic peptides with a luminescent and\nredox-active probe.\n\nGeometries that are more complex than the single strand allow for additional control over the assembly of supramolecular structures, including the potential for synthesizing heterometallic systems and reducing the opportunity for isomer and polymer formation. One of these geometries is the \u201chairpin\u201d motif created through the\nfunctionalization of ferrocene mono- and dicarboxylic acid by aminoethylglycine (aeg)\nchains and further reacted with pendant pyridine or phenyl dipyridylamine ligands,presented in Chapter 4. Four distinct heterometallic structures are formed upon reaction with rhenium, each of which exhibits the characteristic redox properties of both the ferrocene moiety as well as the irreversible oxidative wave for the Re. The diffusion coefficients confirm that the Fc-Re structures are discrete assemblies and not\ncoordination polymers.\n\nAn alternate method to avoid isomer formation is the divergent approach taken from the preparation of dendrimers to synthesize symmetrical peptides, discussed in Chapter 5. These palindromic peptides offer a unique approach toward making duplexes that minimize the potential of both isomer and polymer formation. Preliminarily, a\nbipyridine (bpy) tripeptide is synthesized through this method and the subsequent duplex\nformed upon addition of Cu. The coordination geometry for the copper centers is probed\nthrough spectrophotometric titrations with different salts. Understanding the different\nstructures formed is necessary for future work that will exploit the potential catalytic\napplications for these molecules.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3687], "author_name_tesi": "Levine, Lauren Aimee", "last_name_ssi": "Levine", "middle_name_ssi": "Aimee", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Philip C.

Recent widespread declines in overall pollinator populations have become of increasing concern. RNA viruses are suspected as one of the major contributors to honey bee losses, including the recent syndrome referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD). However, our knowledge of these viral pathogens as they pertain to global distribution or host range is very limited. In this dissertation I investigated the ecology and evolution of some of the RNA viruses found in honey bees as well as in different hymenopteran pollinators and other arthropods associated with A. mellifera colonies. Detection of RNA viruses in thirteen non-Apis hymenopteran species indicated widespread occurrence of these viruses. This study provides evidence of pollen as a route of inter-taxa transmission of RNA viruses in hymenopteran pollinators. Molecular detection of viruses in pollen pellets from foragers, the foragers themselves, and non-Apis hymenopteran species, along with subsequent phylogenetic analyses of these viruses, support our suspicion that these viruses are disseminating freely among pollinators and through pollen itself. Phylogenetic analyses also suggest that A. mellifera is the source of introduction at least one virus into the pollinator community -- Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). In addition to viruses detected in foraged pollen, viruses were detected in the pollen and honey stored in the hive and these viruses remained infectious for at least six months of storage. RNA viruses were also widespread among other arthropod members of the ecosystem surrounding honey bee colonies. Viruses detected in this study were found in six orders in Class Insecta (Blattodea, Coleoptera, Dermaptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera) and two orders in Class Arachnida (orders Araneae and Opiliones). Molecular detection of the negative strand of RNA also suggested active replication of virus in some non-honey bee species.  This evidence suggests that other species might serve as potential hosts for these viruses, and may be part of the overall chain of transmission. However, further studies are needed to determine if these infections represent a single infection of a new host with no further transmission, such that they are transient spill-overs, or if they are part of a sustained host-to-host transmission cycle within new host populations. Many of these RNA viruses are globally distributed. Although A. mellifera is a managed species that is often moved from one location to another, phylogeographic analysis of at least two of these viruses (black queen cell virus (BQCV), and deformed wing virus (DWV)) show evidence of structured phylogeny by location. This suggests that although variants of theses viruses may have been recently spread through the global trade of honey bees and bee products, the defined structure of both BQCV and DWV phylogeny suggest a long history of infection in the regions examined. This dissertation increases our understanding of RNA virus ecology and evolution and may help explain patterns and emergence of disease in A. mellifera and other potential arthropod hosts.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7669], "author_name_tesi": "Levitt, Abby Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Levitt", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Abby", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Holmes", "Kelli Hoover", "Beth Shapiro", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Christina M Grozinger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Kelli Hoover, Dissertation Advisor", "Beth Shapiro, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Christina M Grozinger, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Evolution", "Virus", "Phylogenetics", "Viral Ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EVOLUTION OF LOCAL E-GOVERNMENT IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. \nHISTORY OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE COLLEGE BOROUGH \nGOVERNMENT WEBSITE\n", "id": "12045", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "516", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emergence of the Web 2.0 has renewed interest among politicians, public \nadministrators and academics in the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) \nin government at the local level since municipalities are now facing unique challenges that have \nnever before touched their daily operations.

As e-government evolves, it becomes more capable of promoting the atmosphere of online citizen engagement and building transparent, participatory and collaborative government. \nThe rationale for this research was to expand our current understanding of how local governments (with a population under 50,000) respond to the challenge of developing more transparent, participatory, and collaborative e-government sociotechnical systems (STS). Through the comparative qualitative analysis of six cases  (Bloomsburg, Edinboro, Kutztown, Lewisburg, Shippensburg, and State College), the author intended to answer an overarching research question of how and to what extent town and gown collaboration might contribute to advancing e-government in small college towns in Pennsylvania. The author supplemented this primary question with the following clarifying sub-questions about different factors that could affect a continuous development of local e-government, social media integration into the official municipal websites, and town-gown e-government partnerships.\nThe author conducted a total of thirty-one in-depth, open-ended interviews involving thirty knowledgeable respondents from local governments, universities, and community-based organizations. Other utilized qualitative methods included municipal website assessment, participant observation, and document review. Sociotechnical theory (STT) provided sensitizing concepts (technology, organization, and society) for data collection and analysis and allowed the author to build a grounded theory within those conceptual boundaries. While the STT lens was suited for a high-level interpretation of the e-government phenomenon, the uncertainty surrounding town-gown collaboration in building and transforming e-government called for a grounded theory approach. The researcher also analyzed the relationships among the factors that either contributed to or inhibited local government online and off-line collaboration. Since the development of an e-government STS is always subject to various societal influences and impacts, the author used the Impact-Influence Model (Trauth, 1993) to inform and facilitate the data analysis process. The major contribution of this dissertation is an explanatory theoretical model of e-partnering (i.e., collaboration) between local governments, universities and community organizations. The Town-Gown e-Partnering Model (T-GePaM) explains the intricate interrelationships among the three major constructs, collaboration readiness assessment, collaboration success factors and e-partnering venues.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10574], "author_name_tesi": "Levy, Anna ", "last_name_ssi": "Levy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Watson Bagby", "Eileen M Trauth", "John Watson Bagby", "Lynette Marie Yarger", "Beverly Ann Cigler", "Eileen M Trauth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Watson Bagby, Dissertation Advisor", "Eileen M Trauth, Dissertation Advisor", "John Watson Bagby, Committee Chair", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Member", "Beverly Ann Cigler, Committee Member", "Eileen M Trauth, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Local e-government", "social media", "town and gown collaboration", "sociotechnical theory", "grounded theory", "e-partnering"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Soil Carbon Dioxide Flow Associated With The San Andreas And Calaveras Faults, California", "id": "5932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-03-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Seismic activity may create highly fractured fault zones, providing permeable pathways for the transport of gases from depth to the atmosphere. Also, the flow of deeply derived fluids within fault zones may generate high pore fluid pressures and contribute to fault zone weakness. The spatial and temporal variability, origin, and transport of carbon dioxide in fractured terrain are evaluated from the perspective of field observations along the San Andreas fault (SAF) system, CA, and numerical modeling. In a preliminary soil carbon dioxide study conducted (July-August, 1998) along the Parkfield segment of the SAF, single or double-peak carbon dioxide flux anomalies were observed along fault-crossing transects at five sites. Values of delta C-13 (-23.7 to -21.6 permil) and Delta C-14 (98.4 to 112.4 permil) for soil carbon dioxide were\ncharacteristic of carbon dioxide of biogenic origin. These observations suggest that anomalously high carbon dioxide fluxes are due to enhanced biogenic carbon dioxide flow along fault-related fractures.  Soil carbon dioxide surveys were conducted (February-May, 2000) along the SAF in Parkfield and the Calaveras fault (CF) in Hollister, CA. Carbon dioxide flux was measured within grids with portable instrumentation, and continuously with meteorological parameters at a fixed station, in both faulted and unfaulted areas. Areal trends observed within grids suggest\nthat zones of elevated carbon dioxide flux may be related to subsurface fracturing on small spatial\nscales. Greater spatial and temporal variability of surface carbon dioxide fluxes was observed at\nSAF and CF sites, relative to corresponding background areas. Values of delta C-13 (-23.3 to -16.4 permil) and Delta C-14 (75.5 to 94.4 permil) for soil carbon dioxide are indicative of biogenic carbon dioxide. SAF carbon dioxide flux and meteorological parameter time series indicate that effects of temperature variations on soil carbon dioxide respiration and wind speed variations on atmospheric airflow though fractures modulate surface carbon dioxide flux. Profiles of soil carbon dioxide concentration ([carbon dioxide]) as a function of depth were measured at multiple sites within SAF and CF grids and indicate that advective carbon dioxide flow accounts for up to 85% of the surface flux. Decrease in [carbon dioxide] with depth observed in some profiles suggests atmospheric air flow through soil fractures.  The relatively high spatial and temporal variability of surface carbon dioxide fluxes observed at SAF and CF sites is therefore interpreted to be due to wind-driven atmospheric air flow through more highly fractured soils at these sites, relative to corresponding background areas. The response of soil gas transport processes and resulting soil gas concentration profiles to changing soil physical properties, biological respiration rates, and boundary conditions was tested using one-dimensional finite difference models of diffusive carbon dioxide flow and advective-diffusive carbon dioxide and air flow. When transport is purely diffusive, the shape of [carbon dioxide] profiles is sensitive to soil carbon dioxide production rates, carbon dioxide flux at the base of the soil column, and soil diffusivity. When advective and diffusive transport of carbon dioxide and air are considered, transport processes operating through the soil column and the geometry of gas concentration profiles are most sensitive to the basal gas flux, followed by soil diffusivity, permeability and carbon dioxide production rate. The time required for conditions in [carbon dioxide] and [air] profiles to approximate steady state decreases as the relative advective contribution to flow increases. Results suggest that small magnitude basal gas fluxes can produce total pressure gradients sufficient to drive advective gas flow through soil columns. Therefore, interpretations of soil gas data collected in faulted/fractured terrain should consider the effects of wind-driven air flow through soils on gas transport and resulting soil gas concentration profiles and surface fluxes.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2785], "author_name_tesi": "Lewicki, Jennifer Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Lewicki", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman", "Lee Kump", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["unsaturated zone gas transport", "faults", "Soil gas", "Carbon dioxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Improving Unsteady Hydroturbine Performance During Off-design Operation by Injecting Water from the Trailing Edge of the Wicket Gates", "id": "21585", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9657", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "At their best efficiency point (BEP), hydroturbines operate at very high efficiency (up to ~95%). However, with the ever-increasing penetration of alternative electricity generation it has become common practice to operate hydroturbines at off-design conditions in order to maintain stability in the electric power grid. The present work demonstrates a method for improving Francis hydroturbine performance during off-design operation by injecting water through slots at the trailing edge of the wicket gates. \n\nBy incorporating the concept of circulation control hydrofoils, the injected water causes a change in bulk flow direction at the inlet of the runner. This change in flow angle from the wicket gate trailing-edge jets provides the capability of independently varying the flow rate and swirl angle through the runner, which in current designs are both determined by the wicket gate opening angle. When properly tuned, altering the flow angle results in a significant improvement in turbine efficiency during off-design operation. This revolutionary concept also has the ability to reduce the intensity of the rotor-stator interactions by compensating for the momentum deficit of the wicket gate wakes. A provisional patent application for this technology was filed with the U.S. Patents and Trademarks Office in June 2013 (application number 61836802).\n\nThis concept was explored computationally using loosely-coupled steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a single periodic distributor vane passage and runner blade passage of the GAMM Francis Turbine, a model-scale Francis hydroturbine.  The CFD simulations were performed using a pressure-based finite volume method in OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD software package. In order to add water jets capable of turning the flow, a modified wicket gate design is presented with a beveled trailing edge. Computational experiments show that a +/-5 change in swirl angle is achievable with the new design. This change in swirl angle produces up to 4% improvement in turbine efficiency at 77% of the BEP flow rate and up to 2% improvement in turbine efficiency at 115% of the BEP flow rate. \n\nUnsteady CFD analyses of the complete hydroturbine were also conducted to further validate the wicket gate trailing-edge jet technology, and study the dynamic effect of the rotor-stator interaction. At the low flow rate with a jet speed of 15 m/s, or 2.98% of the inlet volume flow rate, the full-wheel simulations show a 22% increase in head across the runner wheel, a 26% increase in torque, and a 2.7% increase in runner efficiency. The additional power necessary to supply the jets via a pump was estimated by modeling the flow through a representative plenum and jet channel. The pumping power was subtracted from the increase in power obtained from the turbine when operating with the jets. When including the additional pumping power necessary to supply the jet, the overall turbine efficiency increased by only 0.9%, which is still a significant improvement in potential revenue for a Francis turbine. \n\nThe dynamic behavior of the forces on the individual runner blades and wicket gates was analyzed in order to study the effects of blowing on the rotor-stator interaction and unsteady loading of the hydroturbine components. A Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) was performed on the unsteady measurements extracted from the simulations. The computed frequencies agree with the expected fundamental frequencies of this rotating system to within 1.83 Hz (twice the frequency resolution of the DFT). As no unsteady measurements were taken in the experiments, the amplitudes of fluctuation cannot be compared. \n\nThe primary contributions of the present work are the application of high fidelity CFD to simulate a complex 3-D unsteady flow, including the effects of the dynamic rotation of the runner blades, in order to  both evaluate the water injection technology and perform design evaluations of a hydroturbine operating under off-design conditions. Additionally, this work demonstrates the use of OpenFOAM to solve large-scale problems, utilizing Department of Defense High Performance Computing (HPC) systems, and the use of a Taguchi method to develop CFD experiments for design characterization and optimization. Though Francis hydroturbines are the focus of the present work, many of the findings and analysis techniques can be equally applied to other turbomachinery systems, including industrial compressors and pumps, gas turbine engines, and marine propulsors.

AGT is unique among all the other DNA repair pathways as it requires no co-factors or chaperones to carry out DNA repair. O6-Alkylguanine is a highly cytotoxic lesion, and when left un-repaired, leads to G:C to A:T transition mutations. Upon alkyl transfer, AGT continues to bind to DNA and could impede other AGT molecules from repairing DNA. Therefore, degradation might be the only mechanism to remove the alkylated AGT.\n To study human AGT  (hAGT) degradation and intracellular dynamics, we created a Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-hAGT fusion and expressed this tagged AGT in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. GFP-hAGT expressing CHO cells enabled Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showing for the first time, the rapid mobility of AGT within the nucleus. When the entire nucleus was bleached, recovery of fluorescence occurred only after 30 minutes, indicating that AGT accumulates in the nucleus over long periods of time, probably soon after synthesis. The addition of GFP at the N-terminus of hAGT changed some physiological features of hAGT. The half life of the alkylated protein changed from 9h for the native form to 26h for the GFP-tagged form. However, the formation of putative Ub-GFP-AGT species was similar to the ubiquitination pattern and time frame, seen in wt hAGT expressed in CHO cells. This finding suggests that the N-end rule pathway for ubiquitin-mediated degradation may not be the only proteolytic pathway regulating degradation of hAGT.\nFluorophores were used to characterize a novel 16kDa AGT truncation species detected in both CHO and HeLa cells. The cleavage site of this species was determined to be at codon 50, causing the elimination of three of the four ligands required to bind a zinc atom and maintain structural stability. Despite the truncation of the N-terminus, this 16kDa hAGT species showed significant protection from N-Methyl-N\u2019-Nitro-N-Nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induced cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli (E.coli). Together with purified protein AGT activity assays, these data indicate that this truncated AGT species retains the ability to repair DNA. This intriguing finding suggests that this truncated species is either part of a previously unknown degradation cycle, or it has a unique role in the cytosol. \nThe biological role of AGT is to protect cells from alkylation damage generated from endogenous as well as environmental sources. However, as a consequence of its biological role, hAGT plays an important part in tumor cells by causing resistance to some chemotherapeutic drugs such as temozolomide or BCNU, by neutralizing the drug induced alkylation damage. Therefore, in order to combat this effect, a series of AGT inhibitors were created previously to inactivate hAGT and increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. O6-Benzylguanine (O6-BG) is one such, potent inhibitor of AGT, which is currently in clinical trials. \nIn this dissertation, a series of mutant hAGT proteins were created to test for increased sensitivity to O6-BG. Three codons at sites 157, 159 and 160 were targeted because of their location within the O6-BG binding pocket. Our studies confirm that these sites, particularly, a tryptophan at position 160, contribute to a ten-fold lowering of O6-BG ED50. These mutants are unique and rare because a majority of previously characterized AGT mutations within the O6-BG binding pocket cause resistance to O6-BG. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1034], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Candice ", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Candice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Eckert", "Kristin Eckert", "Dr Sreenivas Kanugula", "Hui Ling Chiang", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Robert G Levenson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Eckert, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Eckert, Committee Chair", "Dr Sreenivas Kanugula, Committee Chair", "Hui Ling Chiang, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DNA repair", "AGT", "O6-Benzylguanine"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE REGULATION OF ER CHAPERONES AND PROINSULIN PROTEOSTASIS BY PERK EIF2ALPHA KINASE", "id": "bg257f046", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13137", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Insulin synthesis and secretion are finely controlled within the pancreatic \u03b2 cell. Minor changes in circulating levels of insulin can elicit a major perturbance of glucose homeostasis, which could lead to dysfunction of multiple organ systems, insulin resistance, and, in the extreme, hypoglycemic shock and death. The discovery of monogenic forms of permanent neonatal diabetes highlighted the importance and vulnerability of post-translational proinsulin proteostasis, which includes the regulation of folding, trafficking, quality control, and degradation. Once thought to be housekeeping functions, these processes are all regulated as a function of the metabolic state and demand for insulin.\nLoss-of-function mutations of the protein kinase PERK (EIF2AK3) in humans causes the rare autosomal recessive disease, Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS), which results in permanent neonatal diabetes among other clinical presentations. Perk knockout (KO) mice exhibit the same set of anomalies and thus have served as a model system to study loss of PERK function as well as the physiological functions of PERK in \u03b2 cells. At the subcellular level, severe proinsulin aggregation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of pancreatic \u03b2 cells in Perk KO mice, which was hypothesized to be the molecular basis for the defects in insulin secretion. We show here, for the first time, that proinsulin aggregation in the ER of \u03b2 cells is also found in pancreatic tissue slices from humans with WRS. The root cause of defects in proinsulin processing through the ER in Perk KO \u03b2 cells was originally claimed to be derepression of proinsulin synthesis due to an inability to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, resulting in an overload of proinsulin in the ER. However, we show that proinsulin aggregation can occur in the absence of derepression of proinsulin synthesis while new synthesis is required for aggregation to occur.\nIn genetic models of PERK ablation in \u03b2 cells, we found that key ER chaperones, including BiP and ERp72, were upregulated. We show here that this effect is also seen with acute pharmacological inhibition of PERK activity. Based upon these observations, we postulated a novel and controversial hypothesis that the misregulation of ER chaperones leads to disruption of proinsulin proteostasis in models of PERK ablation. We directly tested this hypothesis by manipulating ER chaperone expression through knockdown and overexpression experiments. We show that transgenic overexpression of BiP and BiP knockdown cause and enhance proinsulin aggregation, respectively, and that BiP shows an enhanced association with proinsulin upon PERK ablation. Furthermore, we found that manipulating the expression of three other key ER chaperones, ERp72, DNAJC3, and PDI, also impacted proinsulin aggregation to varying degrees. Finally, we show that the PERKi-induced proinsulin aggregation phenotype and upregulation of ER chaperones is eIF2\u03b1-dependent.\nThe proinsulin aggregation phenotype and diabetes associated with PERK deficiency highlight the essential role that PERK plays in insulin production in pancreatic \u03b2 cells. Taken together, these studies that encompass my thesis work demonstrate the importance of balancing ER chaperones to achieve control of insulin production and that this balance is mediated through PERK. This work builds on previous knowledge from our lab that PERK plays a physiological role in regulating long-term insulin capacity in pancreatic \u03b2 cells.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12518], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Carrie Rebekah", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "Rebekah", "first_name_ssi": "Carrie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Melissa Rolls", "Zhi-Chun Lai", "Douglas Cavener", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Chair", "Zhi-Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proinsulin", "ER chaperones", "PERK", "EIF2AK3"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "COMPUTATIONAL MODELING OF THE MECHANICS OF FLATFOOT DEFORMITY AND ITS SURGICAL CORRECTIONS\n", "id": "9009", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2094", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Orthopaedic disorders involve abnormal mechanics that can sometimes be corrected by surgery.  Flatfoot deformity involves collapse of the medial arch of the foot, which can lead to severe pain and difficulty in walking.  Surgical corrections involve various alterations of the bones, joints, and muscle attachments with the aim of relieving pain and improving foot mechanics.  Despite being a very common condition, flatfoot is one of least understood and most controversial orthopaedic problems.\n  A methodology was developed for creating subject-specific computer models of anatomically based foot mechanics and for utilizing them in simulations of different surgeries for flatfoot correction.  Magnetic resonance imaging of an asymptomatic flatfoot subject was used to construct three dimensional geometries of individual bones for the model.  Radiographs of the same subject were obtained with the foot under different loading conditions.  Finite element techniques were used to model the contact and movements at the joints, reactions of ligaments, and hyperelastic stress-deformation behavior of soft tissues beneath the foot.  A novel optimization technique was developed to automatically adjust certain soft tissue parameters of the finite element model such that the postures of foot bones were reproduced when standing was simulated.  This tracking was accomplished by matching model bone positions to those measured in radiographs of the same subject.  Custom-written code was developed to automatically perform this matching by repeatedly adjusting the finite element model, performing simulations, and interpreting results.  Techniques were developed to enable the simulations to run quickly while retaining stability and accuracy.  Using the resulting subject-specific model, several surgeries for flatfoot were then simulated, including medializing calcaneal osteotomy and several medial column fusions.  Changes in arch height and plantar pressures were assessed.\n  The numerical optimization technique successfully reduced the differences between model and experimental bone positions of our subject during standing.  Through automatic adjustment of unknown soft tissue properties of the model, differences between bone bounding edges were reduced to an average magnitude of 1.4 mm per edge, whereas a nominal estimate of model parameters gave average errors of 2.6 mm.  Validity of the model was also supported by comparisons of plantar pressures predicted in the model to those measured experimentally from our subject.  Several different types of simulated surgical arthrodesis each increased arch height by more than 3 mm and shifted plantar pressures more onto the lateral midfoot.  Medializing calcaneal osteotomy also shifted plantar pressures laterally, and it slightly increased arch height.  \n  The modeling framework developed in this research enables semi-automated creation and testing of subject-specific biomechanical foot models.  A collection of such models will allow the merits of different surgeries to be systematically tested.  Such testing is not possible with in vivo studies because surgical variations cannot be performed on a patient.  Systematic evaluation of orthopaedic surgeries will lead to better preoperative planning that takes individual subject characteristics into account.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2076], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Gregory Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "H Joseph Sommer Iii", "Ashok D Belegundu", "Neil Sharkey", "John Henry Challis", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Chair", "H Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member", "Ashok D Belegundu, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["orthopaedic", "biomechanics", "optimization", "finite element", "AAFD", "flatfoot", "orthopedic"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Plastics and diagnostic assays with selective and sensitive macroscopic responses", "id": "25836", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11407", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Depolymerizable polymers have been used in a variety of applications including as signal\namplification reagents for sensors, responsive capsules, shape-changing plastics, and\nautonomous analyte-responsive pumps.

Independent of obesity, however, OSA has also been linked to elevations in the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), and the acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) due to stresses induced by intermittent hypoxia. In the interminable quest to identify novel modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, the notion that OSA causes the metabolic syndrome is attractive; however, given the significant overlap in phenotypes, subclinical biomarkers, and health outcomes in obese non-apneics and patients with OSA, the model cannot be so simple. No study to date has attempted to disentangle the relative contribution of obesity-associated inflammation toward the development of OSA, nor how these biomarkers may reflect the cardiometabolic or neurocognitive severity of the disorder. \n\nThis dissertation explores these questions in a representative population sample of 421 adolescents, the Penn State Child Cohort, who were followed up in the sleep laboratory eight years after their initial study visit. Examining OSA in adolescents presents a unique advantage; given that the majority of childhood OSA cases do not persist into adolescence, this age group captures a unique perspective into the early pathophysiology of the disorder. Specifically, based on consistent evidence demonstrating that adipose tissue is a major source of systemic inflammation, we explored five overarching hypotheses. In Chapter 3, we demonstrate how, similar to adults, OSA in adolescents is associated with elevated visceral fat area, particularly in boys. In Chapter 4, we show that inflammation is associated with obesity in adolescents, and is also elevated in those with OSA independent of obesity. In Chapter 5, we illustrate how a significant portion of the relationship between visceral obesity and OSA is mediated by systemic inflammation. Chapter 6 demonstrates how, using longitudinal data from the childhood baseline study, inflammation during childhood predicts apnea and blood pressure reactivity in adolescence. Finally, in Chapter 7, we explore the potential of inflammation (namely, CRP) to serve as a marker of the cardiometabolic and neurocognitive severity of OSA in adolescents.\n\nTaken together, these findings do not support a simple linear model of OSA pathophysiology, but rather a more complex vicious cycle in which visceral fat \u2013 through primarily inflammatory mechanisms \u2013 results in OSA; in turn, OSA is not an endpoint, but contributes to a progressive worsening of related sequelae. The findings in this dissertation may provide a unique perspective and future directions for studying the pathophysiology, prognosis, and potential treatment for OSA in children, adolescents, and adults.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12175], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Jordan Gaines", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "Gaines", "first_name_ssi": "Jordan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexandros N Vgontzas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexandros N Vgontzas, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["obstructive sleep apnea", "sleep-disordered breathing", "sleep", "adolescence", "inflammation", "obesity"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Unveiling the Accretion Disks that Fuel Active Galactic Nuclei", "id": "6771", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3568", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An increasing number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad,\ndouble-peaked Balmer emission lines, reminiscent of those observed in\nCataclysmic Variables; these double-peaked Balmer lines represent some\nof the best evidence for the existence of accretion disks in AGNs.\nThere is considerable evidence to support the hypothesis that\ndouble-peaked emitters are ``clean' systems in which the accretion\ndisk is not veiled by a disk wind.

In this thesis, I study two aspects of\ndouble-peaked emitters, namely the mechanism responsible for\ndiminishing the accretion disk wind and the long-term profile\nvariability of the double-peaked emission lines.\n\nIt has been argued that double-peaked emitters have accretion flows\nthat transition to a vertically extended, radiatively inefficient\naccretion flow at small radii.

Systemic and foliar insecticides provide consistent control of the adult beetles and are the primary management tool available to growers. However, many of these chemicals are excluded from use in organic production systems. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential for development of insecticide resistant populations of A. vittatum and the non-target effects on beneficial insects within cucurbit cropping systems. In this thesis, I explore alternative management options for A. vittatum, considering both efficacy and the potential for integration into an ecologically based pest management system. I first take a systems based approach to A. vittatum management, considering how horticultural production practices shape pest and beneficial insect communities in cucurbit systems. In a two year field experiment, I measured how soil production systems and row cover use influence ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) activity density. The presence or absence of a row cover had no significant effect. However, soil production system did significantly influence the overall carabid community. Certain species, particularly Cicindela punctulata, had significantly higher activity density in a reduced tillage system relative to a conventional till/plasticulture system. Overall, a reduced tillage system also seemed to support greater species richness. These results suggest that horticultural production practices play an important role in shaping the natural enemy community within cucurbit cropping systems. I also monitored parasitism of A. vittatum at two field sites in central PA between June and October 2014. Two parasitoid species were found: a tachinid fly, Celatoria setosa, and a braconid wasp, Centistes diabroticae. Though their presence had been confirmed outside of Pennsylvania, this is the first record of parasitoid activity within the state. Parasitism rates were surprisingly high, reaching up to 56% for C. setosa and up to 17% for C. diabroticae. Based on the results of this initial survey, both species seem to be strong candidates for a conservation biocontrol program. Finally, I integrated two plant and microbial metabolites into a biorational insecticide for A. vittatum: spinosad, a broad spectrum, oral insecticide derived from the soil bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa, and cucurbitacin, a secondary plant metabolite that induces a compulsive feeding response in A. vittatum. I attempted to increase spinosad\u2019s efficacy as a control for A. vittatum by mixing in a cucurbitacin feeding stimulant, which presumable increases beetle ingestion of insecticide droplets. In laboratory bioassays, the addition of cucurbitacin significantly reduced the LC-50 of spinosad, though bioassay data also suggested that male beetles are more responsive to cucurbitacin compared to female beetles. Field trials in 2014 evaluated the efficacy of three different rates of spinosad/cucurbitacin. There was a dose dependent response to the insecticide, with higher rates of spinosad and cucurbitacin providing the best suppression of A. vittatum compared to an untreated control. These results suggest that integrating spinosad with cucurbitacin has the potential to suppress A. vittatum. In the final chapter, I summarize the results of this thesis and suggest future directions for this work. The management practices detailed in this thesis are not intended to be stand-alone tactics. However, with further refinement, each practice has the potential to play a key role in developing an ecologically based management program for A. vittatum.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10799], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Margaret Theresa", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "Theresa", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer", "John Frazier Tooker", "Elsa Selina Sanchez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer, Thesis Advisor", "John Frazier Tooker, Thesis Advisor", "Elsa Selina Sanchez, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cucurbits", "Acalymma vittatum", "reduced tillage", "Carabidae", "biological control", "spinosad", "cucurbitacin"]}, {"year_isi": 2000, "title_ssi": "Gatekeeping For Children:  How the Use of an Electronic Screening Process Affects Teacher Selection in a Region Education Service Center in Texas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "5821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5323", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n     This study examines how electronic prescreening affects hiring of teachers.  Specifically, this study seeks to examine and understand the electronic screening system.  Both traditional and electronic screening methods utilize the resume as the main criterion for deciding whether or not to grant an applicant an interview.  It is the personality profile used in the electronic process which separates these two otherwise similar approaches to employment screening.  Despite empirical evidence which clearly defines the one-to-one interview as the least effective selection tool for predicting future success as a classroom teacher, public school districts continue to rely heavily upon this form of applicant screening (Ponessa, 1997; Bowslaugh, 1993; Darling-Hammond, 1987).  The resume is noted among the most valid selection instruments because it focuses on the relevance of past performance to the currently sought job (Knouse, 1989).  Biases as they relate to gender, age, and ethnicity have been found to affect the decision to accept or reject an applicant (Knouse, 1989; Herriot, 1981; Dipboye, Fromkin & Wiback, 1975).  Although research indicates that traditional interviewers are affected by non-job related factors, little is currently known about how an electronic screening device might affect or eliminate the otherwise subjective biases which can occur.  The use of an electronic screening system was expected to affect positively the selection process.  Biases which might affect the traditional selection process were expected to be removed.  A mixed method case study was used, combining in-depth interviews and archival document analysis of EEO hiring data from 26 member districts of a human resources cooperative.  Findings show that the technology used by the electronic screening system in this study appears to be effective in eliminating bias because EEO data is not requested of an applicant and because the electronic database itself is a logical, neutral process which is not gender-specific.  Results also showed that low minority teacher numbers within the region education service center studied herein are representative of state, region and district ethnicity statistics; are reflective of similar trends in the business community at large; and are a result of factors outside the Pre-interview Phase of the electronic selection process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5300, 5301, 5302, 5303, 5304, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5308, 5309, 5310, 5311, 5312, 5313, 5314, 5315, 5316, 5317, 5318], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, R.

The hope was to investigate the performance of stored willow in ways that are relevant to a downstream biological conversion processes. From the analysis, it can be concluded that the interaction between time and temperature have no effect on dry mass loss.  When the temperature variable was isolated, concentrations were significantly different at or around temperatures close to 19\u00b0C. And when the time variable was isolated, significant differences in rates of dry mass loss were observed during the storage duration from 0 to 60 days. \nThe interaction of time and temperature significantly impact the xylan, arabinan, mannan, and acetyl concentrations. Using a tukey\u2019s comparison evaluation, samples treated for 30 days in 19\u00b0C temperature had statistically different xylan concentration than those samples stored at either 90 day 27\u00b0C temperature or 30 day 40\u00b0C temperatures. Arabinan concentrations of treated samples were significantly different when stored for 60 days at 40\u00b0C than for those stored at 30 days at 27\u00b0C. Mannan concentrations found in the treated samples were found to be the most statistically different for samples stored for 60 days at 27\u00b0C, than for samples stored for 30 days at 19\u00b0C. Acetyl concentrations of treated samples were found to be statistically different when stored for 90 days at 27\u00b0C than for samples stored for 60 days at 19\u00b0C.   \nFor respiration rates, interactions between temperature and time were statistically significant. Willow chips stored at lower temperatures respired at a lower rate than willow chips stored at higher temperatures. These results lead one to conclude that biological activity did occur during this experiment, suggesting that spores and fungus formed over the storage period which may pose health issue for handlers of the raw material. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8925], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Ricky Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Ricky", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard", "Daniel Edward Ciolkosz", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel Edward Ciolkosz, Thesis Advisor", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biofuels", "Respiration", "Storage systems."]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Principals' Perspectives on Autonomy in New York City Schools", "id": "19963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9074", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "School principals across the nation are asked, each year, to implement policy changes in schools that are meant to improve student performance on standardized tests and increase student achievement. Principals, however, face numerous obstacles that prevent them from implementing policies with fidelity to the policy designs. In New York City (NYC) schools, for example, principals were given autonomy to make decisions over operational functions like budgeting, staffing, and curriculum, in exchange for increased accountability. The principals in this study reported that their ability to activate their autonomy was constrained by numerous factors. This case study of NYC schools explores the relationship between mayoral control and principal autonomy in addition to the factors associated with limited principal autonomy by examining, specifically, the process of policy design in the NYC school district and the actual policies created under mayoral control of schools that hinder principals\u2019 abilities to implement the autonomy policy. \n\nThe findings from this study shed light on the complex nature of mayoral control and centralization of urban school districts. First, while mayoral control was a tool to remove unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles, like the elected school boards, it inadequately addressed the looming social issues facing schools and principals daily. Moreover, because the language surrounding the Children First policy was vague policy and the NYC DOE did not provide clear messages for practitioners, implementers developed their own understandings of what autonomy would look like in schools and pursued actions, like firing teachers, which was beyond their sphere of power. \n\nSecond, top-down policy making impedes policy makers\u2019 ability to understand the local context of NYC schools that impacts implementation. The policy process is intricately connected from top to bottom. Without backward mapping from the final stage of implementation to policy design, policy makers were unaware of the low capacity issues that impeded principals\u2019 abilities to implement policies with fidelity. \n\nCollectively, the findings in this study suggest that policy makers should, first, be clear about what they expect from implementers. The clearer policy makers are about policy goals, the more certain implementers can be about what is expected from them. Second, policy makers should backward map from implementation to policy design in an effort to understand the behaviors that act to cause policy problems and the resources needed to help achieve policy goals.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8902], "author_name_tesi": "Lewis, Tiffanie C", "last_name_ssi": "Lewis", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Tiffanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Alexander Gamson", "Erica Frankenberg", "Mindy L Kornhaber", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Alexander Gamson, Dissertation Advisor", "Erica Frankenberg, Committee Chair", "Mindy L Kornhaber, Committee Member", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mayoral Control", "Urban Schools", "School Reform", "Policy Implementation", "Principal Autonomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Protein structure and gene interactions\n", "id": "7459", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The fundamental laws of physics that govern the behavior of inanimate matter also govern the behavior of living organisms; however, biological systems display emergent properties that are not observed in non-living matter.

This study presents the description, validation and application of a generalized 2-D solver. The Essentially Non-Oscillatory (ENO) Scheme is used to solve the homogeneous PDEs, while the forcing functions are solved using the Fifth Order Runge-Kutta Method. Prior to the deployment of the numerical methods for actual application, their performance was assessed by solving many benchmark problems with exact or reliable numerical solutions, which have the essential features of the actual PDEs that we desire to solve. After benchmarking, the solver is applied to a single pipeline to obtain a solution for the sudden valve closure problem and a comparison between the 1-D and 2-D models is conducted. Additionally, 2-D flow through a horizontal pipeline was simulated until a fully developed turbulent flow was achieved.\n\nMore than 80% of gas metering is still performed by orifice meters and considering the actual price of natural gas, a small error of 1% can amount to a loss of millions of dollars per year. Measurements of flow rate are obtained using a semi-empirical equation recommended by the AGA which is known to generate an error of up to 3%. An improved model based on the fundamental conservation laws is presented for flow of natural gas through an orifice meter. The solution of the Navier-Stokes equations considers the viscous effects of the flow and the turbulent effects are accounted by using the Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) approach.\n \nA final validation was achieved by matching experimental data of the mean velocity vector field for air. The maximum error in the axial velocity upstream the orifice-plate between the experimental data and the numerical results is within 3.5%. Moreover, a cross plot for the comparison downstream the plate shows a very good match between the measured data and the numerical predictions. Given the successful validation process, numerical predictions were made for the case of natural gas and a parametric study was conducted varying the Reynolds number, the specific gravity of the fluid and the Beta ratio. Among the most important accomplishments is the successful capturing of the recirculation phenomenon that takes place downstream of the plate. Additionally, the model predicts the flow rate by numerical integration of the axial velocity at a location where a fully developed flow exists. The error between the predicted flow rate and the specified value at the inlet is less than 1%.

In an attempt to confirm the proposed pathway\nbiochemically, two approaches were taken.\n\nCO-grown M. acetivorans is suggested to have soluble methyltransferases\nwhich traverses the CH3-THSPT to CH3-CoM step. In CO- versus acetate-grown\nM. acetivorans QPCR was able to confirm the possibility of genes involved in a\nCH3-THSPT:HS-CoM methyltransferase two-step bypass. In the first approach,\nsoluble cell lysate extract assays of CO-grown cells were examined for methyltransferase activity via methyl group transfer to HS-CoM. The second\napproach, MA4384 a putative methyltransferase believed to be the first step in\nthis bypass was expressed heterologously in E. coli. Several methods of cell\nlysate and heterologous expressed MA4384 methyltransferase assays were used\nin an attempt to exhibit methyltransferase activity.\n\nBesides understanding the CO reduction pathway in M. acetivorans, there\nis also a race to discover and evolve new substrates for methanogens. MekB an\nesterase from Pseudomonas veronii was expressed from a plasmid in M.\nacetivorans. MekB hydrolyzed methyl acetate and methyl propionate into\nmethanol and their respective acid. M. acetivorans was able to utilize the\nmethanol from the hydrolyzed methyl ester for growth. Initial mass balance\ncalculations of methanogenesis from methyl acetate and methyl propionate via\nHPLC and GC showed ~ 25% of acetate and propionate was missing from the\nrespective hydrolyzed ester, as well as an unexpected CH4 to CO2 ratio. The\npossibility of the formation of ethanol for use as an electron sink for\nmethanogenesis from methyl acetate existed and could account for the deficit in\nacetate. Alcohol dehydrogenase assays were able to rule out the possibility of\nethanol as an election sink.\n\nEveryday many doses of drugs are taken; many of these drugs are\nadministered as a racemic mixture. There are many cases where only one\nenantiomer can deliver the actual therapeutic drug action. Separation of the\nenantiomers can increase drug efficacy, but on the other hand may not be economically feasible. Human serum albumin a major constituent of blood\nplasma, readily binds with small molecules with chiral specificity. These binding\nproperties can be improved through protein engineering and exploited for chiral\nseparations of high-value small molecules and for developing customized drug-\nHSA complexes for drug delivery. Yeast surface display could possibly provide\nthe platform needed to screen the engineered HSA mutants with unique and\nenhanced chiral specificity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3794], "author_name_tesi": "Lhu, Lexan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lexan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pat Cirino", "Patrick C Cirino", "James Gregory Ferry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pat Cirino, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick C Cirino, Thesis Advisor", "James Gregory Ferry, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Methyltransferase Proteins", "Methanosarcina acetivorans"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploration of product optimization using consumer-based tools in a coffee-flavored dairy beverage\n", "id": "21555", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9951", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Consumer insight plays a critical role in product development. A product can be optimized based on its formulations or sensory properties by maximizing consumer acceptability (i.e., liking). Both psychohedonic (sensation-liking) and physicohedonic (formulation-liking) models provide their own unique insights into consumer preferences. JAR scaling and ideal scaling have become quite popular to meet the demand of rapid optimization. In both these methods, a product attribute is measured for its dysfunctionality (delta) relative to one\u2019s ideal. Attribute delta (i.e., \u201cToo Little\u201d or \u201cToo Much\u201d) estimates a subject\u2019s dissatisfaction (disliking) level with an attribute quality. Moreover, these methods differ in defining ideal levels on the scale. Dissatisfaction and liking may be two distinct constructs of consumer acceptability. We hypothesized that minimizing dissatisfaction and maximizing liking may yield different optimal formulations. The purpose of this study was to: 1) interpret consumer preference using physicohedonic and psychohedonic models; 2) investigate the difference between ideal scaling and JAR scaling for diagnosing attribute performance; 3) compare attribute delta (Ideal_Delta and JAR_Delta) models against liking models for product optimization of a coffee-flavored dairy beverage.\n\n     Coffee-flavored dairy beverages (n=20) were formulated using a fractional mixture design that constrained coffee extract, fluid milk (2% fat), sugar, and water. Participants (n=388) were randomly assigned into one of 3 research conditions that differed in ballot formats. Each participant tasted only 4 samples out of 20 using an incomplete block design. Samples were rated for liking and intensities for four attributes--sweetness, milk flavor, coffee flavor, and thickness. Data were processed and treated differently to investigate specific research questions.

Specifically, polymer-matrix composites with one or more fillers were investigated, and structuring was realized as: high-aspect ratio dielectric nanofiller with high orientation in films; dielectric nanofiller/dielectric microfiller preferential association; dielectric nanofiller/conducting nanofiller preferential association; and sequestration of nanofillers in one phase of an immiscible polymer blend, among others. Both thermoplastic olefin and elastomeric olefin matrices were studied, and in all cases presented here, highly-enhanced materials properties and non-trivial composite performances were designed to originate from the structuring of the composites, i.e., structuring of the composites qualitatively and quantitatively improves the composite properties far beyond what is achievable through the simple dispersion of the same fillers in the same matrix. The origins of this behavior are traced to filler-cluster mechanisms, or synergies between fillers, or filler-cluster effects on the matrix response, specific to each system/structure/property.

In this project, sensor fusion technology was applied to two artificial noses: the Cyranose 320 electronic nose (Enose) and a surface acoustic wave sensor (zNoseTM), in order to develop a system for non-destructive, rapid detection the safety and quality of fresh produce. \n\nDominant volatile compounds associated with healthy apples and physically damaged apples were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS).  The results proved that the volatile compounds from healthy apples and damaged apples are different both qualitatively and quantitatively. \n\nThe Enose and zNoseTM were firstly independently studied.  Different statistical models, such as PLS-DA and PLS-CVA, were developed and performed on the data on individual days and one single month.  It was found that statistical models were effective for separating healthy from damaged apples when individual days or single month data were analyzed.  When data from different months were combined, statistical models could not give desirable results due to the non-linearity of this problem.  In order to improve the system classification performance, artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to develop classification models.  Three ANN models (back-propagation, probabilistic, and learning vector quantification networks) were developed and tested on data sets collected in three different months.  Results showed that all three ANN models achieved better classification performance than statistical models when data from different months were pooled together for both the Enose and zNoseTM data.  Among these three ANN models, the PNN was superior, considering the classification quality (85% and 77% classification accuracy for the Enose and zNoseTM respectively) and efficiency (training was faster than BP and LVQ).  \n\nAnother focus of this research was to reduce data dimensionality of the Enose and zNoseTM.  Various methods were investigated towards this end.  Although methods such as the PCA loadings method, F-value selection and sequential forward/backward search reduced data dimensionality to various degrees, evolutionary algorithms were proven to be a more powerful and robust search approach.  Evolutionary algorithms reduced data dimensionality 75% and 50% for the Enose and zNoseTM respectively, and the classification error rate for the two instruments was reduced by 10% for the Enose and 20% for the zNoseTM. \n\nMultisensor data fusion models both at the feature and decision levels were developed to combine the Enose and zNoseTM data to improve classification performance.  At the feature level, ANN-based fusion models (dynamic selective fusion) reduced the classification error rate to 1.8% on average in 30 independent runs, and at the same time only about 50% of the sensors from the Enose and zNoseTM were used for input.  At the decision level fusion, a Bayesian network was developed to combine classification decisions made by the Enose and zNoseTM classifiers independently.  It was found that using soft evidence produced by the BP classifier either with or without prior performance knowledge gave the best improvement of classification performance. \n\nFinally, trained models were tested on new data sets which were collected by measuring the presence of one bad apple placed amongst three good apples in a 4 L concentration chamber.  Sensor fusion models could achieve 81% and 82% classification accuracy at the feature level and decision level; when selected sensors were updated, the classification accuracy of sensor fusion models were improved to 97% at the feature level and 91% at the decision level. \n\nThis study introduced three artificial intelligent technologies into food quality and safety evaluation: artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and multisensor data fusion, utilizing information from two advanced volatile detection instruments.  Sophisticated algorithms improved the performance of two artificial noses and showed promise of eventually achieving non-destructive detection of physically damaged and fungi-diseased apples.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1165], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Changying ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Changying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Virendra Puri", "Paul Walker", "Devin G Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Paul Walker, Committee Member", "Devin G Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["probabilistic neural networks", "differential evolution", "covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary algorith", "genetic algorithms", "multisensor data fusion", "evolutionary algorithms", "odor", "artificial neural networks", "olfaction", "gas sensors", "artificial nose", "zNoseTM", "surface acoustic wave sensor", "electronic nose", "back-propagation neural networks", "learning vector quantification networks", "principal component analysis", "partial least square", "discriminant analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A DYNAMIC SUPPLY CHAIN INVENTORY MODEL CONSIDERING SUPPLIER SELECTION, JOINT REPLENISHMENT AND TRANSPORTATION COST", "id": "27466", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12122", "abstract_tesi": "Companies currently face fierce global competition and so they must improve their supply chain efficiency. The development of appropriate decision support tools is important to enable such improvements. The thesis presents a multi-period inventory lot-sizing model for multiple products in a serial supply chain, where raw materials are purchased from multiple suppliers at the first stage, and external demand from vendors occurs at the last stage. Joint replenishment is considered when ordering raw materials. The demand is known and may change from period to period. Stages of this production-distribution serial structure correspond to inventory locations. The first two stages stand for storage areas holding raw materials and finished products in a manufacturing facility; additional intermediate stages represent either manufacturing facilities or centralized warehouses. The last stage is a distribution center that directly serves customer demand. The problem is modeled as a time-expanded transshipment network, which is defined by the nodes and arcs that can be reached by feasible material flows. At first, an integrated approach model aimed at minimizing total cost of the entire supply chain is developed to determine dynamic supplier selection and inventory planning policy at the same time. In addition, a sequential approach model is developed so that inventory planning policy is solved first, and supplier selection strategy is obtained according to that. A comparison between integrated and sequential approaches is shown in the thesis; sensitivity analysis on key factors for the integrated model is presented as well.

In order to make a change to such an undesirable situation, I suggest exposing them to a great variety of fairy tales as the one and only way to broaden their repertoire and to develop their critical thinking ability toward the genre. Classic versions of fairy tales have long been censored for their elements assumed inappropriate for children by adults such as violence and thus been discounted from the formal elementary curriculum. However, from the interviews I conducted for this study, children\u2019s responses disputed such a false adult assumption. To deprive children of the opportunity to read these older texts is actually to prevent an important way to increase their knowledge regarding the genre\u2019s origin. The fresh aspects of these earlier versions unfamiliar to youngsters who have already known roughly about the stories can stimulate their previous recognition and enhance their apprehension of fairy tales. Therefore, I strongly recommend that educators of children use traditional fairy tales as the first step to promote their critical literacy. \nMoreover, in the field of children\u2019s literature, there has been a common tendency to rewrite old fairy tales and bestow them with new possibilities in the past two decades. Many children\u2019s books are retellings of fairy tales using various strategies to overturn or disrupt the stereotypical impressions established through preexistent stories. Such a new kind of fairy tales functions as a \u201csecond chance\u201d for children to question their prior perceptions toward the genre. By introducing them systematically with a juxtaposed reading of these contemporary disruptive variants with the classic versions, we can let children start to reflect and examine the stock knowledge they have held as truth about fairy tales so as to actualize the purpose of promoting critical literacy and further lead to the emergence of their fairy tale literacy.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1245], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Chieh-Lan ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chieh-Lan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Daniel Dean Hade", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh", "Jamie Myers", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical literacy", "fairy tales"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A MULTI-ETHNIC COMPARISON OF SERVICE QUALITY AND SATISFACTION IN NATIONAL FOREST RECREATION\n\n", "id": "6155", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1247", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study focused on recreation use by ethnically diverse National Forest visitors and examined the relationships among cultural background, perceived service quality, satisfaction, and related variables.

For instance, Asians and Hispanics were more willing to endorse Hofstede's power distance (a cultural measure) but Hofstede's masculinity dimension showed no significant differences. Other differences and similarities are noted for socio-demographic, trip details, previous experience and crowding measures. Service quality and trip satisfaction measures showed that Asians were likely to perceive lower service quality than Whites or Hispanics. Because Asians perceived lower service quality, they also tended to be less satisfied than White or Hispanic visitors to the ANF. \n\nUsing a structural equation model analysis, perceived service quality and satisfaction were highly positively correlated, and perceived lower service quality led to less satisfaction. Further analysis discusses the mediation effects in the model, especially those of service quality and experience and show that they play an important role in the relationship between culture and satisfaction.

A central problem for these simulations is that when run on parallel computers the tremendous amount of data generated is often impossible to archive or easily analyze.\nBecause of the way these simulations are written and run, it is often difficult for application scientists and engineers to make specific queries of the simulation results without importing a monolithic file of the simulation's state. Among additional problems are the difficulties in comparing multiple simulation results from different solvers, monitoring the current running status of the application, or modifying simulation parameters without restarting the program. The aim of this thesis is to develop the required algorithms and software tools to address these problems.\n\nThe Scalable Archiving and Visualizing Environment (SAVE) is a software system that integrates an efficient, fast data archiving scheme and a computational steering environment.\nThe system is targeted for the on-line archiving, \nvisualization, monitoring, and steering of large-scale scientific simulations running on parallel computing clusters such as Beowulf systems.\n\nThe fast archiving scheme is based on a functional representation of the numerical simulation results. In this method, the simulation data is approximated by simple mathematical models, such as multi-variable \npolynomials, which once computed are easy to archive, visualize, and query.\nBoth $L_2$- and $L_{infty}$-norm error tolerances can be used in the data approximation. \nThe $L_2$-norm, or least squares solution is \nrelatively straightforward to compute.\nHowever, the $L_{infty}$-norm, or minimax solution, is preferred in many applications because of its more evenly distributed approximation error. A new, efficient algorithm to approximate high-dimensional discrete data based on structured meshes in either least squares or minimax sense is developed. Significant savings in computation and memory can be achieved by taking advantage of the special Kronecker product structure of the coefficient matrix in approximation. To extend the method to unstructured meshes based applications, the approximation is performed using a sampled training set and its verification on an independent testing set.\n\nFor examples from a turbulent combustion application, we demonstrate that large compression ratios can be obtained for multi-dimensional data with the functional representation approach for typical error tolerances. The compression ratio increases with approximation tolerance and order of polynomials.\nHowever, results show that a polynomial of high \norder does not always lead to better compression \nratios. The use of such polynomials can potentially generate ill-conditioned coefficient matrices, which makes these problems difficult to solve accurately.\n\nA new efficient parallel iso-surface visualization algorithm is presented to take advantage of the special data structure of functional representation method. \nThis method is different from marching cubes in \nthat the iso-surface is computed through solving \na set of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) \nrather than interpolation of the grid elements.\nOriented glyphs are attached to solution points \nto visualize the iso-surface. The glyphs' normal directions are efficiently computed from the underlying polynomials. Good speedups are obtained for the algorithm on Beowulf computing clusters. These efficiencies make this method especially useful for large-scale scientific applications.\n\nTo enhance the usability of SAVE, a cross-platforms Graphics User Interface (GUI) is developed to present information of parallel simulations ``on-the-fly,\" accept user input to steer its running behavior, make on-line/off-line query of simulation results, achieve on-line visualization, and automate animations. \nA client-server based manager is developed for \neasy management of parallel simulations running \non Beowulf computing clusters.

The essential objectives of this thesis work are to deepen the understanding on diffuse phase transition of relaxor ferroelectrics and to obtain practical data for potential optical application from technically important ferroelectrics crystals PBN and PZN-PT. \nTemperature dependent birefringence and optical refractive indices of PBN (Pb1-xBaxNb2O6) crystal (1-x=0.57) were measured in several optical wavelengths (\u0192\u00dc= 694nm, 633nm, 535nm, and 450nm) to understand the optical frequency dependency of ferroelectric phase transitions in relaxor ferroelectric crystals of tungsten bronze structure.  Local polarization is verified to be dynamically activated by thermal process and probed effectively by suitable wavelength of light.  An optical isotropic point, as a function of temperature and light frequency, is reported at which the crystal\u00a1\u00a6s standing birefringence is fully compensated by polarization.  A modified single oscillator model is used to calculate the index of refraction in the ferroelectric phase.  The deviation temperature from the single oscillator model is reported to be significantly marking the crossover from macroscopic to microscopic polarization.  A new parameter, optical Curie temperature region, defined by the temperature difference between the well known Burns temperature and the deviation temperature (from the single oscillator model for index of refraction) is explored for its significance in depolarization behavior of the micro- to nano-polar regions of the ferroelectric relaxor.\nTemperature dependent optical indices of refraction of PZN-0.12PT (1-x)PbZn1/3Nb2/3O3-xPbTiO3, x=0.12, were also studied with emphasis on poling effect.   The refractive index n3 decreases as a result of [001] poling. Temperature dependent effective energy of dispersion oscillator   and dispersion energy   were calculated using single oscillator model and found that  and   increased by 32% and 60% after [001] poling, respectively. Birefringence of poled PZN-0.12PT also was measured with several frequencies and varying temperature. The polarization derived from refractive index and birefringence were consistent with each other. The remnant polarization was increased by approximately 30% as a result of [001] poling. Transmission spectrum of PZN-0.12PT was measured from near UV to IR for both poled sample and unpoled sample. Transmission was improved significantly after poling. By analyzing the transmission spectrum in the visible range, optical band gap and lattice phonon were determined.

Most prior research that investigated multi-institutional attendance patterns focused on two-year college students. This dissertation shifts the research focus to students starting at four-year institutions who need to attend other institutions to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree. Three research questions regarding the students\u2019 decision process for enrollment were as follows: (a) What factors affect the students\u2019 choice of educational pathways; (b) what factors affect transfer students\u2019 choice of destination institutions; and (c) how do educational pathways affect the probability of bachelor\u2019s degree attainment among students involved in different educational pathways? \nThe interactionalist model which indicates that students filter institutional environments through their characteristics and pre-college experience and then make decisions of persistence or withdrawal serves as the overarching conceptual framework of this study. Student\u2019s outside-college experience is considered for students who have ever broken their enrollment in higher education. Each research question employs different research methods including logistic regression, the hurdle model, and Heckman\u2019s two-step model. \nThe major research findings of this study are that students who attended more selective institutions for their first matriculation have greater odds of returning to their original institutions than of transferring to other institutions after stopping out. Institutional attributes show a statistically significant but trivial influence on students\u2019 decisions. Moreover, transfer students have a much lower probability of bachelor\u2019s degree attainment than students who stayed until the end of the sixth year of first matriculation. Students who broke their enrollments in higher education have an even lower probability of degree attainment than continuous transfers. \nStudents who are continuously enrolled in higher education, yet attend more than one institution, appear to be less likely to obtain a bachelor\u2019s degree than the ones who stay in one institution. Such results suggest that policy makers should encourage students to remain in their original institutions. Educational practitioners may inform students of the risk of degree incompletion by attending more than one institution on one hand, but assist transfer students in better integrating into destination institutions on the other. Given that this dissertation examined students who transferred only once, a future study may extend the current research by considering students who are involved in more complex educational pathways. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1587], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Dai ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald E Heller", "Roger Lewis Geiger", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Spiro E Stefanou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald E Heller, Committee Chair", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Member", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["educational pathways", "degree attainment", "college choice"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles by Microwave-Assisted Solvothermal Technique\n", "id": "6694", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1650", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Metal nanoparticles of Ag, Ni, Pd, and Pt were synthesized in this research work by microwave-assisted solvothermal technique.

It turns out that traditional monolithic processor architectures\nscale poorly with technology due to diminishing improvements in clock rates and the increasing\ninterconnect delay. Such architectures cannot efficiently transform the fertile on-chip resources\ninto computing capability. Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs), integrating multiple relatively simple\nprocessing cores on a single chip, are becoming the trend for microprocessor design, as\nwitnessed by both industry and academia.\nProcessors, interconnection networks, and memories constitute the three major components\nof a CMP architecture. This thesis optimizes two of these components, namely, interconnection\nnetwork and memory subsystem. When the number of processing nodes of CMPs scales\nup, a new type of interconnection network, Network-on-Chip (NoC), is normally employed.\nThus, we study the emerging interconnection network for CMPs: NoC, and a critical component\nof the memory subsystem for CMPs: the on-chip, level-2 (L2) Non-Uniform Cache Architecture\n(NUCA). Targeting these components, this thesis proposes a set of hardware and software\noptimization schemes.\n\nThe first part of this thesis uses compiler-directed approaches to reduce the energy consumption\nof NoCs. Three compiler approaches are proposed, including proactive communication\nlink turn-on/off, compiler-directed voltage selection for communication links, and profiledriven\nmessage rerouting. The experimental results with array/loop-intensive applications demonstrate\nthat the compiler-directed approaches are more efficient in reducing the NoC energy consumption\nthan pure hardware-based power management schemes.\nThe second part of this thesis targets the design of high-performance L2 NUCA design\nand optimization for CMPs. The contribution of this part includes both a novel 3D NoC-bus\nhybrid NUCA design and a migration-based NUCA design. We demonstrate, through extensive\nexperiments, that the 3D circuit technology is quite efficient in shortening the wire delay and\nthus reduces the L2 NUCA access latency. The other NUCA proposal is a careful migration\nscheme (eviction-triggered migration and access-triggered migration), aiming at finding a proper\nphysical location for each cache line in L2.

Preliminary results on different approaches to enhance bulk laminate sensor performance have been investigated together with my colleague by Zhao Fang. To achieve sensor integration, an easily controlled deposition process\u2014ion milling sputtering for Metglas\u00ae (Fe85Si10B5) thin film has been developed and in-situ magnetic domain alignment can be accomplished at room temperature as the film is being deposited. The thin film has been characterized by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) for atom composition, SQUID measurement for domain alignment and deflection measurement for magnetostrictive (MS) coefficient. \nThe first direct integration of thin film Metglas\u00ae/ Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) cantilevers shows the quality factor enhancement at the resonant frequency and sensitivity of  1.8 V/T. To improve the integrated sensor performance, a Metglas\u00ae thin film based magnetoelectric flexural gate transistor (MEFGT) has been realized with the capability of tiny vector magnetic field sensing. The device combines the benefits of high-deflection property of MS cantilever sensors with FET based motion sensing by integrating a magnetostrictive thin film micromechanical cantilever directly atop a sensing and amplifying transistor.  Both optical and electrical measurements show the advantage of MEFGT in small magnetic field detection. A sensitivity of 1.5 mV/\u03bcT, which corresponds to 150 pT/\u221aHz minimum detectable field (MDF), has been reported as the most sensitive integrated ME sensor to date.\nPost simulations of MEFGT have been done to analyze both the mechanical and electrical performance. Device noise modeling and analysis on transistor flicker noise has been established. A strained Si0.5Ge0.5 quantum well FET is introduced as the readout transistor candidate which exhibits the lowest reported flicker noise performance for future low noise sensor devices.\nBuilding on the results of MEFGTs, several readout circuits has been demonstrated.  Onboard signal conditioning circuits of charge mode and voltage mode have been realized for both bulk sensors and thin film sensors. Design and simulation for the front-end readout amplifier has been also demonstrated for the on-chip magnetic sensor system.

Unlike early information sharing approaches that only involve a small number of databases, new information sharing applications are often assumed to be built atop a large volume of geographically distributed databases. Moreover, with increasing concerns on protecting the sensitive and/or proprietary data, the organizations prefer sharing data in a more secure and privacy-preserving manner, instead of establishing a purely full trust relationship and releasing the control over the shared data. In this dissertation, we explore new information sharing infrastructures to address the new challenges on security, privacy, and scalability.\n\nWe first explore access control deployment strategies in distributed information sharing and the impacts of different deployment strategies on system-wide performance and security. From our study, we are motivated to enforce in-network access control by combining query security checking function with query routing function in Query Brokers. We introduce a new efficient yet secure distributed information brokering system (IBS) with in-network access control enforcement. It is a mediator-based overlay atop a number of loosely-federated databases, providing unified on-demand data access to authorized users. Then, we turn our focus to privacy protection. We analyze the privacy of different stakeholders in this on-demand data access process, and present two types of privacy attacks. In distributed IBS, Query Broker with information-rich metadata becomes the most vulnerable target of privacy attacks. To protect Query Brokers from being abused by insiders or comprised by outside attackers, a fundamental solution is to equip each Query Broker with only least yet necessary metadata so that any leakage will not cause meaningful privacy disclosure. We propose a new privacy-preserving information brokering infrastructure, with a core idea of automaton segmentation. Original Query Broker, which is a non-deterministic finite automaton, is split into multiple segments so that compromising one or a small number of segments will not cause severe privacy loss. Another important type of privacy that needs to be protected is the identity of the users who ask the query. While common privacy enhancing techniques such as encryption can partially solve the problem, we still need more powerful tools for better protection. In this second part of this dissertation, we study the anonymous communication systems, and propose a new node-failure-resilient protocol that better suits the distributed IBS scenario.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1959], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Fengjun ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fengjun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "Chao Hsien Chu", "Dongwon Lee", "Guohong Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Chair", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["information sharing", "privacy", "XML", "anonymous communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "History Dependent Modeling of Counter-Current Flow in Porous Media\n", "id": "6067", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2141", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-11-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gravity-driven counter-current flow occurs in reservoir processes such as gas storage in an aquifer and certain secondary and tertiary recovery processes. In order to operate these processes effectively, it is important to understand and to be able to model the flow process. Both drainage and imbibition processes exist simultaneously when counter-current flow occurs. It has been difficult to model this type of flow process because of the impossibility of assigning a single capillary pressure curve applicable over the entire sample in this situation. The focus of this study is to find a method for accurately representing capillary pressure in counter-current flow.\n\n\nGravity-driven counter-current flow experiments have been done in glass bead packs and the spatial and temporal saturation distributions of the core sample obtained with X-ray computed tomography (CT). With the aid of a deterministic reservoir simulator, capillary pressure and relative permeabilities were extracted by matching the saturation distribution with optimization methods (history-matching). This work applies a saturation-history-dependent approach to simulating counter-current flow. From the capillary hysteresis loop, a family of curves (called scanning curves) is constructed connecting the two branches. Each grid block of the sample is assigned a different scanning curve according to its current saturation and saturation history. \n\n\nThis technique was used to simulate previous laboratory experiments in glass bead packs. The simulation reproduced two-dimensional saturation distributions over time with good accuracy. Similar simulations of experiments described in the literature were equally successful.

Although near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) can achieve nanoscale spatial resolution and various ultrashort pulse diagnostic tools can characterize femtosecond laser pulses, yet such capability to non-invasively characterize the nanoscale characteristics of femtosecond pulses in all three spatial dimensions remains elusive.\nIn this dissertation, we developed different types of nonlinear optical probes to characterize ultrashort optical pulses. The nonlinear optical probe is composed of three parts, a silica fiber taper, a single nanowire bonded to the end of the fiber and nonlinear nanoparticles attached on the tip of the nanowire. The optical fiber taper can be readily mounted on a mechanical stage and served as a macroscopic interface for handling and positioning control. The single nanowire bridges the dimension gap between the nanocrystals and the fiber taper, and is critical for achieving large aspect ratio and hence minimizing optical scattering and perturbation. The nonlinear nanoparticles give rise to its capability to characterize ultrashort optical pulses. The unique fusion of nanoscale and nonlinear features in developed nonlinear optical probes provides the ability of probing ultrafast optical field in complex 3D micro- and nano- structures. The demonstration of such ability is crucial for understanding the interaction of ultrafast optical fields and nanoscale systems. The fabrication processes of the nonlinear optical probes are illustrated in detail and the optical properties of the probes are investigated.\nTwo different types of nonlinear optical probes, two-photon fluorescent nanoprobes and Second HARmonic nanoProbes (SHARP), are fabricated. Interferometric autocorrelation measurements near the focal point of an objective through two-photon fluorescent nanoprobes are presented. By replacing the two-photon fluorescent nanoparticles with second harmonic nanocrystals on the tip of optical nanoprobes, more advanced pulse characterization technique, frequency resolved optical gating (FROG), can be applied and detailed pulse profile information, including both amplitude and phase profiles, can be retrieved. The spatial resolution of SHARP is limited by the size of the nanocrystal on the tip. By employing auxiliary focused ion beam (FIB) nanomilling technique, we also fabricated SHARP containing only a single nonlinear nanocrystal. Pulse characterization near the focal point of a high numerical aperture objective by using the SHARP is demonstrated. Furthermore, ultrashort optical pulse characterization results in complex micro- or nano-structures, such as in the core region of a hollow-core photonics crystal fiber, based on collinear second harmonic generation-frequency resolved optical gating (SHG-FROG) measurements are presented.

The morphology and void fraction are characterized systematically in various ways. It is found that these ECR-PECVD deposited Si films have a column/void structure consisting of three levels of nano-structure: a tapering first level agglomerate (cluster) column structure with widest diameters of 70-80nm in the studied thickness range and a second level of columns that make up the clusters, each with a constant diameter of 10-20nm depending on deposition conditions. The third level arises from the fact that these second level columns are built by the third level 10-20nm diameter elongated nano-crystalline Si blocks of various degree of crystal fraction. The clusters are surrounded by interconnected nano-voids with a radius up to 50nm. The films have a large surface to volume ratio and the nano-crystal size, void size, void content, and specific surface area are tunable through adjusting deposition conditions. The void content and specific surface area are as high as 55% and 180m^2/g, respectively. A high deposition pressure and low microwave power deposition conditions gives the largest void content and specific surface area. A growth model is also proposed based on the experimental evidence. This model is used to explain the formation of the tapering first level clusters. The depositions are done at low temperatures and a wide range of substrates can be used for different applications.\n\nSince vapors can easily condense in a small void (pore) due to capillary condensation, a humidity sensor was fabricated based on these nano-structured column/void Si films. This humidity sensor has high-sensitivity (6 order of magnitude of conductivity change in the studied relative humidity range), high-speed (response time less than 1 second), and low hysteresis. Its behavior is reproducible. It can be miniaturized and integrated with signal processing circuits.

Breaker selection guidelines and breaker schedule optimization are presented at last and field cases are followed as practical examples. \nGel breakers are generally grouped into three classes: oxidizers, enzymes, and acids. All of these materials reduce the viscosity of the gel by breaking connective linkages in the guar polymer chain. Oxidizing agents decompose to produce \u201cfree radicals\u201d which attack the polymer chains and bring about degradation. For enzymes, they will then attach to that polymer strand until it can completely degrade the polymer. The enzymes will ride to wherever the polymer travels. Acid breakers often act as a necessary component to reverse the fracturing fluid crosslinking process in matrix acidizing. They tie up the crosslinking ions and break the polymer crosslink bondings.\nThe performances of breakers which are influented by formation temperature, fracture fluid pH and formation mineral.

This dissertation reports progress on a few components for flexible electronics with a special focus on process development, system integration, flexibility testing, and improvements in flexibility. In this dissertation, a rigid-substrate-compatible, lamination- and transfer-free process is developed to fabricate ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) on very thin (~5 \u03bcm) solution-cast polyimide substrates. The flexible ZnO TFTs have very similar electrical characteristics to ZnO TFTs fabricated on rigid glass substrates. Typical TFT mobility is > 12 cm2/V\u2219s for a gate electric field of 2 MV/cm. Inverters and 51-stage ring oscillators have been demonstrated using ZnO TFTs on thin flexible substrates. After a simple mechanical release, most TFTs show unchanged electrical characteristics on the freestanding flexible substrates. The performance of the flexible TFTs also remains the same when bent to radii between 7 mm concavely and 5 mm convexly.\n\nVanadium oxide (VOX) films have been studied as a temperature sensing material. Motivated by its potential of high-rate and uniform deposition, we investigated using RF diode sputtering to deposit VOX films as an alternative to the currently most commonly used ion-beam deposition. We found that process control for bolometer-grade VOX is very difficult. Small changes in oxygen-to-argon inlet ratio result in dramatic changes in the resistivity of the deposited VOX films, and a positive feedback mechanism drives depositions performed without active control to become either metallic or high resistivity films. We found that the local oxygen partial pressure near the reactively sputtered target varies with the oxidation of the target and is thus a strong candidate for an active control mechanism for reproducible reactive RF diode sputtering of VOX thin films. \n\nAs efforts have taken place towards integrating more functions into flexible electronic systems, flexible organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been demonstrated on the same thin flexible substrate as for the aforementioned flexible ZnO TFTs. The OLEDs use sputtered ITO anodes, evaporated organic layers, and evaporated Al top cathodes. Green light emission is confirmed for both on-rigid-carrier and freestanding flexible OLEDs. A direct patterning technique based on substrate surface energy contrast for parylene films as an encapsulation layer for electronic devices, including OLEDs, is also reported. \n\nThe mechanical flexibility of flexible electronics is investigated in the context of testing strategies and the experimental results of different types of measurements. Besides the commonly reported static bending test, the strategies and apparatuses for repeated bending tests by push-to-flex and roller-flex are developed with the capability of in-situ electrical measurement while bending or flexing. Our flexible ZnO TFTs survive more than 50,000 repeated bending cycles with a bending radius of 3.5 mm with very little change in electrical characteristics. With a smaller bending radius of 1.6 mm, the modified TFTs with Ti gate survived more than 10,000 bending cycles. For a better understanding of device failure mechanisms, numerical simulations for strain and stress distributions in flexible structures under various stretching and bending conditions are carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics. Means to improve device flexibility have also been proposed based on the experimental and simulation results.  \n\nThe work reported in this dissertation represents developments in multiple aspects for flexible electronics and helps to pave the pathway to ubiquitous flexible electronics. This dissertation also provides a foundation for further study and development of the fabrication process and flexibility improvements for flexible electronic devices and systems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11200], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Haoyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haoyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Noel Christopher Giebink", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Noel Christopher Giebink, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Flexible electronics", "thin film transistors (TFTs)", "oxide semiconductors", "polymeric substrate", "mechanical flexibility", "VOx", "OLED"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF CELL MORPHOLOGY ON NANOPARTICLE UPTAKE AND UPTAKE AT THE LEADING EDGE IN MC3T3 CELLS", "id": "15391hsl5047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15391", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When using the correct material coupled with drugs and specific surface ligands, nanoparticles can have enhanced targeted drug delivery properties. Currently, scientists can alter the size, shape, material, and surface properties among other factors in order to change the characteristics of the nanoparticles and how the body reacts to them1. While much research has been done looking at how varying the properties of nanoparticles affect nanoparticle uptake, little research has been done to see how varying cell properties affect nanoparticle uptake. Additionally, it is known that the extracellular matrix of tumor tissue is different than that of healthy tissue.  The differences in ECM organization causes the tumor cells to take on certain patterns, which may affect nanoparticle and drug uptake.  The aims of this project are twofold: first, I will compare the rate of nanoparticle uptake at the leading edge to that at the trailing edge, then, I would like to see how cell morphology affects nanoparticle uptake.  The results from these experiments indicate that there is a difference in nanoparticle uptake in elongated and non-elongated cells.  The leading edge of a cell also appears to contain more nanoparticles than the trailing edge of a cell; however, this is not dependent on cellular elongation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16896], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Harvey S", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Harvey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown", "William O Hancock", "Xiaojun Lian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown, Thesis Advisor", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Xiaojun Lian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cell", "cell morphology", "nanoparticles", "endocytosis", "immunostaining", "live-cell imaging", "MC3T3 cells", "microcontact printing", "y-27632"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS WITH SINGULARITIES: A PRIORI \nANALYSIS AND NUMERICAL APPROACHES\n", "id": "8675", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2352", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elliptic equations in a two- or three-dimensional bounded domain may have singular solutions from the non-smoothness of the domain, changes of boundary conditions, and discontinuities, singularities of the coefficients. These singularities give rise to various difficulties in the theoretical analysis and in the development of numerical algorithms for these equations. On the other hand, most of the problems \narising from physics, engineering, and other applications have singularities of this form. In addition, the study on these elliptic equations leads to good understandings of other types of PDEs and systems of PDEs. This research, therefore, is not  only of theoretical interest, but also of practical importance. \n\nThis dissertation includes a priori estimates (well-posedness, regularity, and Fredholm property) for these singular solutions of general elliptic equations in weighted Sobolev spaces, as well as effective finite element schemes and corresponding multigrid estimates. Applications of this theory to equations from physics and engineering will be mentioned at the end. \n\nThis self-contained work develops systematic a priori estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces in detail. It establishes the well-posedness of these equations and proves the full regularity of singular solutions between suitable weighted spaces. Besides, the Fredholm property is discussed carefully with a calculation of the index. \n\nFor the numerical methods for singular solutions, based on a priori analysis, this work constructs a sequence of finite element subspaces that recovers the optimal rate of convergence for the finite element solution. In order to efficiently solve the algebraic system of equations resulting from the finite element discretization on these finite subspaces, the method of subspace corrections and properties of weighted Sobolev spaces are used to prove the uniform convergence of the multigrid method for these singular solutions. \n\nTo illustrate wide extensions of this theory, a Schroedinger operator with singular potentials and a degenerate operate from physics and engineering are studied in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7. It shows that similar a priori estimates and finite element \nalgorithms work well for equations with a class of singular coefficients. \n\nThe last chapter contains a brief summary of the dissertation and plans for possible work in the future. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2337], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Hengguang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hengguang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Nistor", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Jinchao Xu", "Anna L Mazzucato", "Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Nistor, Committee Chair", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Chair", "Jinchao Xu, Committee Member", "Anna L Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["the finite element method", "weighted sobolev spaces", "singularities", "elliptic equations", "a priori analysis", "the multigrid method"]}]
