Samples of different magnitudes of deformation (25%, 70%, and 110%) were selected as oriented samples.  For use as controls, amorphous and crystalline unoriented PLA sample were produced under similar temperature and pressure conditions.  Differential scanning calorimetry was used to confirm a constant glass transition temperature of 63\u00b0C and a constant melting temperature 149\u00b0C independent of orientation.  Differential scanning calorimetry confirmed that the degree of crystallinity increased with orientation.  Wide angle x-ray diffraction demonstrated that the \u03b1 crystal structure was formed during initial crystallization and amorphous chains orient parallel to the deformation direction and convert to crystalline regions during orientation.  Small angle x-ray scattering verified that orientation did not affect the long period spacing.  Finally, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy was able to confirm that orientation lead to the formation of additional rigid amorphous regions in between crystalline regions and at the crystalline and amorphous interface.  Uniaxial orientation lead to a decrease in dielectric strength and a broader segmental relaxation, but the mean relaxation time and temperature were unaffected.   \n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7839], "author_name_tesi": "Ellis, Annie Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Ellis", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Annie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Poly(Lactic Acid)", "crystallinity", "dielectric relaxation spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Simulation studies of the glycosylation code", "id": "22562", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10077", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis reports computational studies that investigate the impact of protein-\ncarbohydrate and protein-protein interactions upon protein structure and folding. The\ncore of this thesis, which is found in Chapters 2 and 3, examines the biophysical consequences of glycosylation.\n\nIn Chapter 2, replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations investigate\nthe underlying mechanism for an experimentally observed conformational switch that\n is induced by the glycosylation of a short peptide. In order to distinguish between the\n effects of specific and nonspecific interactions with the carbohydrate, these simulations\n considered model peptides that were N-linked to a disaccharide and also to a steric crowder of the same shape. The simulations suggest that nonspecific steric crowding by the\n N-linked disaccharide did not significantly alter the peptide free energy surface. However, the combination of steric crowding with specific interactions, e.g. hydrogen bonding\n and aromatic-glycan stacking, dramatically impacts the peptide ensemble and stabilizes\n the conformational switch. Motivated by these results, Chapter 3 investigates sequence\n specific effects of N-linked glycosylation by performing a series of REMD simulations for\n peptides that correspond to point mutations from the sequence considered in Chapter 2.\n The simulations suggest that sequences with glycine adjacent to the glycosylation site\n readily form compact beta-turns upon glycosylation, while        sequences with alanine in this\n location appear to be much less influenced by the glycan. Somewhat surprisingly, the\n simulations suggest that aromatic-glycan interactions are less significant for this conformational switch.

Corn, one of the most economically important crops in the United States, is a crucial source of food, fuel, and consumer products.  The European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis (H\u00fcbner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)) threatens producers in the U.S. and Canada with more than $1 billion in annual crop damage.   Many studies have investigated various aspects of European corn borer biology; however, little is known about female corn borer movement, which directly impacts where larval damage will occur.  Temporal and spatial aspects of dispersal also affect pesticide resistance management and population gene flow.  The development of current knowledge also requires more insight into female corn borer oviposition (egg-laying) decision-making.  \nThis dissertation research uses results from a range of experimental scales to synthesize the description of factors that influence female European corn borer oviposition behavior.  Previous research has shown that female corn borers prefer taller, more mature plants when laying eggs.  Individual plant-based experiments suggested that plant leaf area is a major plant maturity factor influencing female oviposition choice.  However, no solid evidence indicated that females respond to plant height when laying eggs.\nFirst-generation European corn borers tended to oviposit on the earliest-planted corn, while second-generation females preferred later plantings.  During the second-generation peak, these late plantings were in late vegetative or early reproductive stages; earlier plantings were less succulent and near physiological maturity.  Although female European corn borers exhibit general plant maturity preferences, egg infestation predictions based on comparisons among available planting dates are not accurate.  Infestation predictions may only be feasible with exhaustive sampling, which is impractical.\nField- and farm-scale dispersal studies showed that many newly-emerged females flew out of the immediate area before laying egg masses.  These results suggested that many females fly over 500 meters, though some mate and lay eggs less than 50 meters from their emergence point.  Oviposition decay by distance, a function of dispersal, is apparent within 1 acre of a mass emergence site.  Beyond this local scale, however, dispersal patterns are less evident.\nAnalysis of larval survival among various plant growth stages suggested European corn borer oviposition preference follows optimal oviposition theory.  Offspring success generally corresponded with oviposition preference.  Larval survival was highest on plants infested at early reproductive stages; these were found to be most attractive to ovipositing females in the other experiments.  Survival rates and larval weights were lowest in the youngest vegetative plantings.  Within-plant egg mass position also affected larval success; larvae were significantly more likely to survive on plants infested at the ear zone than those placed on higher leaves.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3305], "author_name_tesi": "Ellis, Katherine Ave", "last_name_ssi": "Ellis", "middle_name_ssi": "Ave", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis D Calvin", "Dennis D Calvin", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Paul Heinz Heinemann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis D Calvin, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis D Calvin, Committee Chair", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["European corn borer", "Ostrinia nubilalis", "field corn", "dispersal", "oviposition", "preference", "optimal oviposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Flowering cover crops as an early-season floral resource for native bees in Pennsylvania agroecosystems", "id": "20156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conservation of natural processes such as pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling are essential to maintaining a healthy agroecosystem.  The incorporation of cover crops into annual crop rotations is one practice that is used in the Northeast U.S. to manage soil fertility, weed suppression, and erosion control.  Additionally, cover crops that have a flowering stage have the potential to support beneficial insect communities, such as native bees.  Because of the current decline facing managed honey bee colonies, the conservation of native bee communities is critical to maintaining \u2018free\u2019 pollination services.  However, native bees are negatively affected by agricultural intensification and are in decline across North America.  This project assesses the potential of flowering cover crop species to act as a conservation resource for native bee communities, in addition to providing benefits to soil fertility and agricultural production.  Three flowering cover crop species are evaluated here across various crop rotation schedules and at differing levels of cover crop diversity.  Flowering resources were monitored for each of these studies along with native bee and Syrphidae fly visitation. \n\nIn conclusion, cover crop species selection, cash crop rotation schedule and plant diversity level all had significant influence on the floral resources available to the native pollinator community.  Different cover crop species not only had different blooming schedules and winter survival responses to planting date, but attracted unique native bee communities to their available floral resources.  Additionally, flower density was shown to be the driving factor influencing differences in bee visitation frequency across treatments, but within cover crop species, for both the plant diversity and fall planting date experiments.  The results from these experiments should be influential in informing future conservation and grower extension recommendations on the applied use of flowering cover crops for pollinator conservation purposes in Pennsylvania annual cropping systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9293], "author_name_tesi": "Ellis, Katherine Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Ellis", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Ellen Barbercheck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pollinators", "native bees", "cover crops", "conservation", "agriculture"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Improving the Convective Forecasts of the Federal Aviation Administration\n\n", "id": "10752", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4233", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The effectiveness of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control is improved via a radar image generational algorithm developed to improve FAA convective forecasts by generating an ensemble of radar image realizations capable of being integrated into air traffic flow management software.

The results from the four-channel reactor model show that the computer runtime required in the implicit solution method is much greater than the required runtime for the well-developed and optimized explicit solution method.

G. molesta is suspected to migrate between apple and peach crops depending on the time of the growing season and the seasonal suitability of the crops for its progeny.  In Pennsylvania, apple and peach orchards are often planted within 50 meters of each other. These crop-related factors, coupled with prospects for sex pheromone mating disruption over large areas (or, \u201carea-wide mating disruption\u201d) have made understanding G. molesta movement patterns imperative for management programs incorporating synthetic sex pheromones.  Therefore, I investigated the temporal and spatial dispersal of male G. molesta in the presence of apple and peach orchards.  Sex pheromone trapping; mark-release-recapture techniques; weather data; a geographic information system (GIS) and a variety of statistical methods were employed to make inferences about environmental variables in apple and peach orchards that influence male G. molesta dispersal.\nAdult female and male G.molesta reared on a dietary substrate mixed with 6,000 mg Rubidium Chloride (RbCl) per L liquid diet were successfully labeled with rubidium (Rb) above a threshold (i.e., the amount of Rb in unlabeled moths + 3 SD) considered sufficient for labeling in mark-release-recapture studies.  The Rb had no adverse effects on development or reproductive behavior.  Both male and female moths labeled with Rb as larvae retained a signature detectable above the baseline up to seven days after adult eclosion.  In wind-tunnel bioassays, Rb-labeled male G. molesta were observed for completion of successive behaviors leading to flight to a sex pheromone point source.  Males were more likely to exhibit lock-on behavior than unlabeled moths, despite insignificant differences in the numbers of moths completing the sequential behaviors preceding lock-on.\nSignificant temporal variation was detected in counts of four broods of wild moths captured in sex pheromone traps in apple and peach research orchards from 1999 to 2005 at The Pennsylvania State University Fruit Research and Extension Center (PSU-FREC) in Biglerville, PA.  After accounting for variations due to time, it was concluded that the remaining variation in the moth trap-counts in the apples and peaches were mainly attributable to increasing resident G. molesta populations over time.  Logistic growth functions were employed to generate flight curves and 95% confidence intervals based on estimated brood \u201ccutoffs\u201d according to accumulated degree days in each crop.  These curves were found to be not significantly different when compared between crops.  Despite excellent fits of the research-orchard data to the logistic models, the majority of sex pheromone trap count data collected from commercial orchards throughout Adams County, PA from 2002-04 were not within the 95% confidence intervals and did not correspond closely to the modeled curves.  I suspect that the failure to establish biofix at the commercial sites combined with site-specific variation was culpable in the poor fits.  \nFluorescent powders were not detrimental to male or female G. molesta adult longevity.  Female moths released between an apple and peach orchard were more likely to be recaptured on pane interception traps near the top of canopies in peach and ca. 1 m from the orchard floor in apple.  Male G. molesta released in orchard rows directly opposite sex pheromone traps with commercially-available sex pheromone lures were most likely to fly the shortest distance (150 m) to traps, crossing orchard rows despite other sex pheromone traps being 200, 250 or 300 m directly upwind of the release points.  Male G. molesta released into commercial apple and peach orchards were most likely to remain in the crop of release and to not exhibit host shifts over the season, even after peach fruit were harvested.  At one commercial site released moths were significantly influenced by wind.  They were more likely to be recaptured in traps directly upwind than not upwind.  Recapture of moths decreased over distance; the majority of moths were recapture 50 \u2013 100 m from the release point at both sites regardless of crop.  At Site A, one individual was recaptured 554 m from the release point.  Of 10,171 total moths released in both crops in 2004 and 2005 at Site A, 87 (0.86%) were recaptured &#8805; 300 m from the release points.  Of 11,832 total moths released in both crops in 2004 and 2005 at Site B, 10 (0.085%) were recaptured 250 to 300 m from the release points.  The apple and peach host crops appeared to affect male G. molesta dispersal to the extent that wind in orchards affects their perception of pheromone; and the presence of wild females may affect their mating status and likelihood to disperse.  By integrating a predictive model of  egg-hatch with flight phenology models or spatial statistics of dispersal data, future research may possibly refine understanding of G. molesta natural history in the context of its management on apple and peach hosts. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4619], "author_name_tesi": "Ellis, Nicolas H", "last_name_ssi": "Ellis", "middle_name_ssi": "H", "first_name_ssi": "Nicolas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Larry Allen Hull", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Dennis D Calvin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Larry Allen Hull, Committee Chair", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Member", "Dennis D Calvin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Grapholita molesta", "dispersal", "tree fruits", "mark-release-recapture", "flight phenology"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "IN SITU STRIPLINE LAMINATE PROPERTY EXTRACTION ACCOUNTING FOR EFFECTIVE SURFACE ROUGHNESS LOSSES", "id": "14035jje144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A method of extracting the effective copper surface roughness of a laminate in situ is introduced.

The essential psychological dynamics underlying the disorder are poorly understood.  In particular, the role of identity disturbance in the disorder is largely unexplained, although several prominent theories have been advanced.  Psychodynamic theories posit that identity disturbance underlies emotional and behavioral dysregulation, whereas biosocial theory suggests that identity disturbance is the result and largely not the cause of these other symptoms.  Research to date has been largely cross-sectional and based on retrospective report, making it difficult to untangle the temporal dynamics of BPD symptoms.  In addition, new research based on ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which could potentially shed light on this question, has focused on groupwise hypotheses and analyzed interindividual data.  This approach does not account for potential heterogeneity in these processes, whereas person-specific methods based on intraindividual variation can account for this heterogeneity.  The current study uses dynamic factor analysis, a person-specific modeling approach, to investigate the longitudinal covariation of anger, impulsivity, and identity disturbance.  11 psychiatric outpatients who were diagnosed either with BPD (n = 4) or with a mood or anxiety disorder, but not BPD (n = 7) completed a 21-day EMA protocol by rating these symptoms six times per day at quasi-random times at roughly 2-hour intervals.  Cubic spline interpolation was used to produce time series with equal spacing between measurements, and models were created to describe the relationship between these symptoms, both in synchronous ratings and at successive time points.  Models were created using examination of modification indices from a baseline autoregressive model, and multiple fit indices were used to determine good fit.  Results revealed extensive variability between individuals in the dynamics of anger, impulsivity, and identity disturbance, although a simple autoregressive model fit data well for six participants.  The results support neither psychodynamic nor behavioral theories of BPD symptom dynamics but imply that each may account for symptom variation in different individuals with the disorder.  Results also show that a person-specific approach to modeling EMA data is feasible and may support the development of theories of psychological processes in BPD.

Diet satisfaction increased for subjects in both groups; in particular, the intervention diets were perceived to have greater health benefits, fewer negative aspects, work better within the family context, and lead to less preoccupation with food than did the baseline diets (p < 0.0001). Results show that reducing dietary energy density, particularly by increasing fruit and vegetable intake and decreasing fat intake, is an effective strategy for managing body weight, controlling hunger, and maintaining subject satisfaction with their diet.

Their beliefs, practices, and identities were defied, dismissed, and exploited. Even America\u2019s popular culture represented them as villains and as outsiders. Yet through this medium, Mormons recognized the traits of western culture defined, to some extent, American identity. By leveraging the terms of western mythology to their advantage, Mormons mitigated their marginalized status to become the version of themselves that Americans desired. \n\nIncorporating the fields of American studies, folklore, gender studies, western studies, religious studies, geography, art, and literature, this dissertation investigates how members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints adapted the mythology of the American West in their quest to assimilate into the American ethnic and religious mainstream between the years 1890 and 1930. I contend that after recognizing American\u2019s growing affinity for the symbols, rhetoric, images, icons, characters, and geography of the American West readily available to the public in the form of popular culture, Mormons employed the components of these Western mythical narratives for their own religious, political, economic, and cultural gain. After establishing the dissertation\u2019s core questions and methodology in Chapter One, Chapter Two examines the planning, advertisements, and proceedings of the 1897 Utah Pioneer Jubilee as evidence of Mormons rescripting their pioneer past and emphasizing their pioneer identity. Chapter Three investigates the evolution of Mormon masculinity, tracing such decisions as the masculinization of Church leaders back to the masculine ideal popularized by western narratives. Chapter Four contends Mormons\u2019 evolving sense of place as reflected in their relationship with and exploitation of Utah\u2019s land and waterways, reveals their belief that national belonging would come by selling the nation the idea that Utah was home to unique and iconic Western, and by extension, American landscapes. Finally, Chapter Five explores the historiography of Brigham Young and traces his public transformation from a polemic religious leader into a heroic American trailblazer and colonizer. This dissertation demonstrates that by establishing a western identity and rescripting their history, beliefs, and the lives of their leaders to fit within the parameters established by the Western narrative, Mormons exposed an avenue whereby they and other marginalized Westerners could gain cultural acceptance and a sense of national belonging when other traditional roads appeared closed. This dissertation, therefore, offers a more nuanced, more complicated picture of western history, Mormon identity, and the role of the American West in establishing a sense of national citizenship and belonging.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10579], "author_name_tesi": "Ellsworth, Brant Wesley", "last_name_ssi": "Ellsworth", "middle_name_ssi": "Wesley", "first_name_ssi": "Brant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles David Kupfer", "Simon Josef Bronner", "John Rogers Haddad", "Christopher Hollenbeak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles David Kupfer, Dissertation Advisor", "Simon Josef Bronner, Committee Member", "John Rogers Haddad, Committee Member", "Christopher Hollenbeak, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mormonism", "American West", "Western Narrative", "Masculinity", "Identity Construction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR NAME LINKAGE AND THEIR APPLICATIONS", "id": "8705", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1908", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to identify entities, their names (e.g., the names of persons or movies) are among the most commonly chosen identifiers.

Since publication of this ratio in 1982, counseling centers have been advised to maintain minimum staffing ratios of one full-time equivalent (FTE) staff member to every 1,000-1,500 students on campus (Spivack et al., 2010). Yet the large majority of today\u2019s counseling centers have ratios above those cutoffs, and the implications of this ratio for college students\u2019 mental health have never been empirically assessed.  This dissertation was the first to examine whether student to staff ratios were predictive of the number and frequency of clients\u2019 sessions (dosage), and counseling center treatment effectiveness in reducing student distress.\n\tThis dissertation employed data from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health (CCMH), a collaborative practice-research network that currently comprises more than 250 college counseling centers that use a common data management system (Hayes, Locke, & Castonguay, 2011). The present study focused on data from 2,041 students and 37 counseling centers from the 2010-2011 academic year.  For each counseling center that participated in CCMH data collection, student to FTE staff ratios were computed as the total student population relative to number of full-time professional staff and paid trainees per counseling center.  Change in student distress from intake to final session, as measured by the CCAPS-32, was used to quantify centers\u2019 treatment effectiveness.   Number of sessions that clients received from FTE staff, as well as the average length of time between sessions, were used to quantify center-level mean dosages.\n     In general, findings indicated no significant associations between ratio, dosage, and effectiveness, though post hoc analyses provided some interesting, preliminary evidence about potential differences between public and private schools.  Specifically, while private schools showed no relation between ratio and treatment effectiveness, public schools demonstrated the hypothesized relation: public schools with larger ratios saw a lower percentage of clients receiving effective treatment.  Moreover, findings suggested that the majority of schools were able to provide relatively effective treatment despite falling outside of recommended ratio ranges.  More broadly, results suggest that the relations between student to staff ratios, dosage, and counseling center treatment effectiveness are multi-faceted, likely influenced by an array of factors requiring further consideration.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10021], "author_name_tesi": "Elreda, Danny ", "last_name_ssi": "Elreda", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Danny", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hayes", "Jeffrey Hayes", "Kathleen Bieschke", "Benjamin D Locke", "Louis Georges Castonguay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Hayes, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Hayes, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Member", "Benjamin D Locke, Committee Member", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Counseling centers", "dosage", "treatment", "effectiveness"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Strategic Processes in a Transitioning Industry: Entrepreneurial Orientation, Knowledge-based Resources and the Performance of Firms\n", "id": "15438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7889", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the scope of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) research continues to progress, there is a growing need for the examination of EO and its relationships within carefully defined contexts.

Research into these systems has become increasingly prevalent due to the wide variety of physical examples that exhibit these characteristics, as well as recent advancements in computational capability and parallelism. A notable example of coupled systems occurs in fluid-structure interaction (FSI), in which a deformable solid is surrounded by and/or immersed in a fluid. These systems exhibit strong, two-way coupling between the fluid and solid domains that require the development of expanded computational methods to solve. While current methods have provided the basis for the solution of these types of problems, optimizations are needed to solve realistic FSI problems. \n\nExisting overset mesh technology has been incorporated into an ALE based Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) code, producing a novel approach for investigating fully-coupled FSI phenomena. In particular, the Suggar++/DiRTlib overset mesh technology has been implemented into a partitioned FSI solver based on OpenFOAM and an in-house structural code. The impetus of this solver has been to address some of the problems that occur in complex FSI simulations, most notably concerns with the mesh motion experienced in large deformation cases. The overset solver intends to simplify mesh generation, maintain mesh quality throughout the simulation, and provide similar performance to current approaches. This thesis provides verification of the overset FSI solver and presents the effects of overset methods on FSI simulations.\n\nVerification is presented through the method of manufactured solutions on the disparate solver components and mesh refinement studies are performed on the coupled code. The method of manufactured solutions provides rigorous code verification, with error magnitudes and solver convergence rates determined for the separate solver components. Discussion of the challenges experienced in the establishment of a unified manufactured solution for partitioned FSI algorithms is also presented. The disparate solvers used in this work are found to exhibit the expected orders of convergence, verifying the correct implementation of the governing equations in these domains. A mesh refinement study with Richardson extrapolation further confirms the monotonic convergence of the FSI solution, and provides insight into the order of accuracy of the coupled solver.\n\nUse of the Turek and Hron benchmark case facilitates a consistent comparison of the proposed solver to current FSI methods and performance.

This trend has been apparent to health researchers for decades. Using a five-category metropolitan status variable, I examine rural-urban continuum differences in women\u2019s receipt of the Human Papillomavirus Virus (HPV) vaccine, papanicolaou tests, and mammograms. Guided by Andersen's Behavioral Model for Health Services Use (1995), this dissertation assesses the importance of individual- and contextual- level enabling factors in contributing to rural/urban continuum differences in women's utilization of reproductive health care. This research aims to 1) Describe rural-urban continuum difference in mammogram and cervical cancer screening utilization and HPV vaccination among adult women in the U.S.; 2) Identify the individual and contextual factors that contribute to rural-urban continuum differences in these outcomes; and 3) Determine whether metropolitan status moderates associations between these enabling factors and service utilization. I conduct analyses on two reproductive health screenings (papanicolaou test and mammograms) and HPV vaccination. I use recommendations from the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assess receipt of these services in the recommended time frame. Several important findings emerge. Women in metropolitan counties are more likely than those in nonmetropolitan counties to have received recent pap tests and mammograms, with the lowest screening rates among women in the smallest rural areas. Metropolitan status is not associated with HPV vaccination among adult women. Women\u2019s individual-level enabling factors, including household income, educational attainment, health insurance status, access to a personal physician, and medical cost barriers contribute to these rural/urban differences in salient ways. This dissertation advances the extant literature by identifying the importance of moving past the rural/urban dichotomy to understand differences cancer screening receipt and by identifying which enabling factors are the most important predictors of screening and vaccine receipt along the rural-urban continuum. These findings inform implications for practice, policy, and research toward improving rural women\u2019s receipt of cancer screening recommendations.

Genital infection with certain high-risk papillomavirus types is a primary cause of cervical cancer.  The papillomaviruses are comprised of an 8 kb double-stranded circular genome encapsidated by two structural proteins.  The major capsid protein, L1 is the predominant element in the physical assemblage of the viral capsid, while a minor structural element, L2, is far less abundant, but necessary for infectivity.  \n\tAntibody responses to the major capsid protein have been well characterized. Humoral immunity to the L1 protein immunogen, assembled into virus-like particles (VLP), is vigorous and generally type-specific.  Although VLP-based vaccines elicit protective virus-neutralizing antibodies, they are encumbered by the type-specific immunity generated, when tremendous inter- and intra-type diversity is exhibited by the over 100 different HPVs identified to date.  Thus, the L2 protein has been assessed for its ability to generate neutralizing antibody responses that may display cross-reactivity.\n\tAside from a probable role in genome encapsidation, L2 may also function in early events of host cell infection and in the disruption of nuclear architecture prior to capsid assembly.  An examination of the cellular proteins with which L2 associates could provide clues as to the specific function of this protein in viral infection and virion morphogenesis.\n\n\nThe primary objectives of this thesis project were: 1) to derive monoclonal\nantibodies specific for L2 proteins from several different virus types; 2) To assess antibody responses against a specified region of L2 with regard to antigen reactivity, specificity, the ability to neutralize virus, and protect animals against experimental papillomavirus infection; and 3) in a limited fashion, to examine L2-associated proteins.\n\tL2 proteins from rabbit and human papillomaviruses were cloned, expressed, purified and used as immunogens in a variety of vaccine regimens.  L2 was found to be a poor immunogen, for which the purity and quantity of L2 antigen affected the yield of antigen-specific hybridomas significantly.  Three hybridomas specific for rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV) L2 and one targeting HPV-16 L2 were generated.  Additionally, two hybridomas that produced antibodies specific for L2-associated proteins were isolated.  These reagents may provide useful tools for studies on the structural and functional properties of L2.  \n\tThe region consisting of amino acids 108-120 from HPV-16 L2 has been reported to elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies, by experimental ?pseudovirion? neutralization.  An assessment of the immunogenic properties of this peptide and its HPV type 6 and 11 homologue, extended HPV L2 peptides incorporating additional conserved residues, and peptides from the corresponding regions of ROPV and cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), was undertaken.  Antibody responses to peptide immunogens exhibited heterologous peptide cross-reactivity, but this did not translate into protein reactivity in all cases.  HPV-16 L2 peptide antiserum exhibited moderate levels of cross-neutralization, as determined by an in vitro assay of authentic HPV-11 neutralization utilizing quantitative RT-PCR, where the extended peptides elicited generally better responses.  The immunization of rabbits with peptides encompassing the relatively divergent complementary region of L2 from ROPV and CRPV resulted in virtually complete protection from high-dose viral infection with the cognate virus.  This resulted predominantly, if not completely from the induction of L2-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies.  Thus, although further studies are warranted, this region of L2 possesses the ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies that could potentially protect from an array of human viral types.\n\tHeat shock proteins (Hsps) assist in the proper folding and localization of a vast range of polypeptides.  Their roles in viral processes, including virion assembly and nuclear targeting of viral proteins have been widely reported.  A notable ?contaminant? of L2 preparations was theorized to be Hsp70.  Indeed, this protein was shown to bind L2 specifically and was detected in capsid protein preparations, including virus-like particles and virion extracts.  Additionally, Hsp70 was detected in VLP prepared from cell lysates, but not in those derived from long-term culture supernatants, suggesting provisional association, perhaps in the process of capsid assembly.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4055], "author_name_tesi": "Embers, Monica Erin", "last_name_ssi": "Embers", "middle_name_ssi": "Erin", "first_name_ssi": "Monica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil David Christensen", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Danny Welch", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Mary K.

This is the first multilevel quantization scheme in the literature with a rigorous proof of uniform convergence with respect to the grid size and the number of grid levels for nonconstant densities. The proposed scheme can be generalized to higher dimensions, and both scalar and vector versions demonstrate significant speedup comparing to the traditional Lloyd method. We also provide some new characterizations for the convergence of the  Lloyd iteration and other possible acceleration techniques including Newton-like methods. \nFor the second optimization problem, this thesis presents a novel algorithm aimed at automating phase diagram construction in complex multicomponent systems.

The model is of the linear-viscoelastic type, and is applicable to the design and analysis of multiple concentric-ring PMC flywheel rotors in a state of plane-stress.  This model incorporates techniques for approximating the quasi-static response to general time-varying loads including rotation, temperature change, and interference-fits between adjacent rings.  The model accounts for the effect of temperature on the material response using the time-temperature superposition principle.  The quasi-elastic technique was used to discretize the linear viscoelastic constitutive law, allowing the derivation of approximate solutions for the stress and strain field variables.  Experimental work performed in support of this model includes thermo-viscoelastic characterization of a unidirectional glass/epoxy composite.  Experimental measurement of pressure loss and strain redistribution in interference-fitted filament-wound glass and carbon fiber PMC ring pairs was performed using moir\u00a8\u00a6 interferometry and electrical resistance strain gages.  Good agreement between the data and the plane-stress model at locations away from the ring interfaces was obtained.  With the purpose of making creep measurements through the radial thickness of high-speed rotating flywheels, a new optical displacement measurement method was developed.  Notable improvements over a known related method include greater displacement sensitivity, the ability to measure rigid body vibrations and separate the associated vibration-induced displacement from the strain-induced displacement, and the ability to compensate for sensor drift during flywheel operation.

While many women artists of the nineteenth century continue to garner critical attention, no sustained analysis of their self-portraiture yet exists.  These portraits, whether traditional or innovative, public or private, present to the viewer rare insight into lives of women artists and emphasize their awareness of and interest in their own subjectivity.  In addition to providing a physical likeness, these self-portraits underscore the contemporary interest in selfhood and open exciting avenues of research. \n\nNineteenth-century notions of the self were highly influenced by a new understanding that the self was something carried within and that it was the locus of identity.  As this budding cult of the self was on the rise, women artists entered into the fascinating dialogue of selfhood through the creation of self-portraits.  These images reveal not only how they perceived themselves, but also how society at large defined women\u2019s positions and forms of expression.   \n\nRosa Bonheur, Marie Bashkirtseff, Eva Gonzal\u00e8s, and Louise Breslau are the primary focus of this dissertation.  Bonheur, an unconventional artist who wore trousers and painted animals, was the first female to receive a Legion of Honor award.  Bashkirtseff was a Ukrainian immigrant who enjoyed high-society life, but secretly wrote letters in support of women\u2019s rights and produced self-portraits exploring her identity in various guises. Eva Gonzal\u00e8s was the only official pupil of the Edouard Manet.  She boldly associated herself with a highly controversial teacher and produced a series of self-portraits that present her serious and introspective personality.  Louise Breslau used the genre of self-portraiture to solidify her connections with her female friends and assert her sexual and artistic identity. These images indicate that the central elements of Breslau\u2019s identity were her status as an artist and her female relationships.   \n\nThis dissertation, the first to focus specifically on women\u2019s self-portraits in the nineteenth century, sheds new light on the careers of these specific artists as well as clarifies the shifting philosophical and psychological beliefs about the self and how they informed women\u2019s lives and perceptions. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3047], "author_name_tesi": "Emmer, Janalee ", "last_name_ssi": "Emmer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Janalee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke", "Sarah K Rich", "Leo Mazow", "Willa Zahava Silverman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy Elizabeth Locke, Committee Chair", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member", "Leo Mazow, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nineteenth-century France", "Women artists", "Self-portraiture", "Female Identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Role of Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 in Glutamate Cysteine Ligase Induction by Organoselenium Compounds\n\n", "id": "8177", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5902", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nLevels of dietary selenium are inversely associated with cancer risk in humans, and selenium has played a major role in the field of chemoprevention. In particular, the organoselenium agents 1,4-phenylenebis(methylene)seleno-cyanate (p-XSC) and its glutathione conjugate, p-XSeSG, are effective in preventing cancers at numerous sites, including the lung in rodent models. In the A/J mouse lung, p-XSC is highly effective in inducing glutathione (GSH), but mechanisms are not well understood. Glutathione is the most abundant antioxidant in animals, and is an important mechanistic factor in chemoprevention. Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for GSH production. Transcriptional regulation of GCL occurs via antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the promoter regions of its genes. Induction of the ARE is in turn regulated by stabilization and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor, Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2). Furthermore, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has been shown to play a role in Nrf2 stabilization. Potent chemopreventive phytochemicals, such as sulforaphane (SFN), have been shown to act largely through the Nrf2/ARE pathway.\nThe potential relevance of Nrf2 to GSH induction led to the hypothesis that Nrf2 activation may be involved in organoselenium-mediated induction of GSH, and this was investigated in vivo and in several cell culture models. Here we show that dietary p-XSC induces Nrf2, p-ERK, GCL and GSH in the lung of the Fisher rat, suggesting involvement of Nrf2 and the ERK pathway in GSH induction. In addition, GSH and GCL were induced by p-XSeSG in the Fisher rat. In cell culture studies we observed that p-XSC and p-XSeSG activate an ARE luciferase reporter in an Nrf2-dependent manner. It was also shown that p-XSeSG induced GSH in vitro, and is less toxic than p-XSC. The dependence of GCL induction by p-XSeSG upon Nrf2 was confirmed in wildtype and Nrf2-mutanted Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF). These results suggest that p-XSC acts through the Nrf2 pathway in vivo, and that p-XSeSG may be the metabolite responsible for such activation, thus offering p-XSeSG as a less toxic, yet highly efficacious inducer of GSH.\nIsothiocyanate compounds such as SFN are among the most potent Nrf2 inducers known. We hypothesized that substitution of sulfur with selenium in the isothiocyanate functional group of SFN would result in an isoselenocyanate compound (SFN-isoSe) with enhanced Nrf2 induction capability. Here we show that SFN-isoSe activates an ARE-luciferase reporter in HepG2 cells more potently than SFN. It was also found that SFN-isoSe induces GCL and GSH in MEF cells in an Nrf2-dependent manner. Finally, we provide evidence that SFN-isoSe is more effective in killing HepG2 cancer cells, yet is less toxic to non-cancer MEF cells, than is SFN. These data support our hypothesis, and suggest that SFN-isoSe may be a highly effective chemoprotective agent in vivo.\nTaken together, these results support the hypothesis that Nrf2 is required for organoselenium-mediated induction of GSH, and suggest that the induction of the Nrf2 pathway by organoselenium compounds may represent a general mechanism of chemoprevention. Induction of GSH, with low associated toxicity, by agents like p-XSeSG may prove useful for treatments of conditions such as HIV and chronic inflammatory conditions. Isoselenocyanates, such as SFN-isoSe, may be ideal candidates for future studies as chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agents due to their ability to induce Nrf2 with low toxicity in normal cells and high efficiency at killing cancer cells.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5898], "author_name_tesi": "Emmert, Sans Wellington", "last_name_ssi": "Emmert", "middle_name_ssi": "Wellington", "first_name_ssi": "Sans", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Peter Richie Jr.", "Karam E El Bayoumy", "Thomas E Spratt", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Craig Matthew Meyers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Chair", "Karam E El Bayoumy, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glutathione", "organoselenium", "Nrf2"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PARAMETRIC MODELS FOR DYNAMIC EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENT", "id": "9735", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2105", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The efficiency measurement literature has been almost exclusively based on a static view of the firm. In this static context the optimality of decisions is measured against the best practice frontier in a period-by-period basis and without any connection along time. This dissertation departs from the techniques used by static models of efficiency measurement and accounts for the intertemporal nature of the decision-making process at the firm level. The cost associated with the adjustment of the stock of quasi-fixed production factors is identified as the link between current decisions and future production possibilities. The objective of the firm is assumed to be intertemporal cost minimization.\n\nTwo parametric models for efficiency measurement are developed and estimated. The first model is based on the argument that when the adjustment of quasi-fixed factors is costly, dynamic optimization may prescribe a plan that would force a technically inefficient firm to remain partly inefficient in the short run. The implication of intertemporal cost minimization is that inefficiency in static models is likely to persist over time. This implication is incorporated to the techniques used for static efficiency measurement and estimation of a reduced-form model is proposed within the state-space modeling framework. The applicability of the model is illustrated using two panels of dairy farms from Germany and the Netherlands.\n\nThe second model is centered around efficiency measurement with respect to capital stock. The firms\u2019 managers are assumed to form rational expectations with respect to future prices and minimize the expected discounted cost of producing a given stream of output. Estimation is based on a system of equations consisting of the variable cost function, the cost-share equations and the derived Euler equations. A relatively new econometric technique is employed for the estimation which combines regression and factor analysis. The structural model is applied to a panel of food-processing plants from Mexico.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2086], "author_name_tesi": "Emvalomatis, Grigorios ", "last_name_ssi": "Emvalomatis", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Grigorios", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "Spiro E Stefanou", "N Edward Coulson", "Jeffrey R Stokes", "Murali Haran", "Alfons Oude Lansink"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Dissertation Advisor", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Jeffrey R Stokes, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member", "Alfons Oude Lansink, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["efficiency measurement", "dynamic models", "microeconomic models"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK BASED DESIGN PROTOCOL FOR WAG IMPLEMENTATION IN CO2 INJECTION USING FISHBONE WELLS IN LOW PERMEABILITY Oil RESERVOIRS", "id": "14918kae5168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increasing oil recovery and decreasing production costs in unconventional reservoirs is in great demand due to current low oil prices. The oil price drop affected unconventional oil production to a greater degree than conventional oil production because of its low production rates and high production costs. The objective of increasing oil recovery and decreasing production costs of the unconventional oil reservoirs leads to an introduction of new technology and techniques. Many studies have been conducted to identify new techniques with high capabilities of increasing oil production from unconventional resources. Unconventional oil reservoirs are the reservoirs that cannot feasibly produce oil using conventional production techniques. These reserves include tight oil, oil shale, and bitumen.\nThe first objective of this work is to introduce a new production technique that is capable of increasing oil recovery, decreasing production costs for unconventional oil reservoirs, and decreases the greenhouse gas emissions. The second objective is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based toolbox to evaluate and optimize the implementation of the proposed technique. The proposed ANN toolbox provides the necessary knowledge to understand the performance of the CO2 injection technique in low permeability reservoirs when utilizing fishbone well designs. A better understanding of how the implementation of the fishbone well design and CO2-WAG injection affects the production from low permeability reservoirs, will help to increase oil recovery, decrease production costs, and decrease environmental impacts. A better understanding of how the implementation of the fishbone well design and CO2-WAG injection affects the production from low permeability reservoirs will help to increase oil recovery, decrease production costs, and decrease environmental impacts. \nThe proposed production technique combines two successfully applied techniques in the unconventional reservoir production. The first technique is the Water Alternate Gas (WAG) injection technique implementation with carbon dioxide. The second technique is the fishbone multilateral well designs. The proposed techniques have successfully proven their capability of increasing oil production from unconventional reservoirs, but there are no previous studies that combined both techniques in the same project.\nWater alternate gas is a known term that describes an enhanced oil recovery process whereby water injection and gas injection are carried out alternately for periods of time to provide better sweep efficiency and reduce gas channeling from injector to producer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most commonly used gas for this process because it improves hydrocarbon contact time and sweep efficiency while decreases the greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe fishbone well design is a multi-lateral well technique which has been successfully used to improve production from low permeability reservoirs. The fishbone well design is a series of multilateral well segments that trunk off a main horizontal well. The appearance of the fishbone well closely resembling the ribs of a fish skeleton deviated from the main backbone. Fishbone well design increases the production by increasing the contact area with the reservoir. The utilization of the multi-lateral well technique increases the cumulative fluid recovery, decreases the environmental footprint and decreases the drilling and completion costs. \nAn Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that flows through the network affects the structure of the ANN due to the adaptions it makes to provide the desired output. ANNs are considered nonlinear statistical data modeling tools where the complex relationships between inputs and outputs are modeled.\nANN toolbox has been developed to evaluate and optimize the implementation of CO2-WAG injection in low permeability reservoirs using fishbone well design. The developed toolbox provides the needed information to develop a successful production plan for the reservoir under consideration. The designed toolbox has four primary functions. The first function is to predict the fluid flow rate profiles for the reservoir under consideration, with fishbone well and WAG injection implementation. The second function is to provide a reliable WAG injection design for a project with known reservoir properties while also creating a functional fishbone well after the field goes through a period of primary production. This will achieve the desired level of recovery for the project. The third function is to provide a reliable project design for the reservoir under consideration. The project design consists of a fishbone well design and a WAG injection design to achieve a desired level of recovery. The fourth function is to understand the reservoir properties using the production data. The toolbox can compare thousands of WAG designs and multilateral fishbone well design combinations in a more rapid manner when compared to commercial simulators.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16728], "author_name_tesi": "Enab, Khaled Ahmed", "last_name_ssi": "Enab", "middle_name_ssi": "Ahmed", "first_name_ssi": "Khaled", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Sanjay Srinivasan", "Gregory R King", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Sanjay Srinivasan, Committee Member", "Gregory R King, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Enhanced Oil Recovery", "WAG", "CO2 Injection", "Unconventional Oil Reservoirs", "Tight Oil Reservoirs", "Artificial Neural Network", "Machine Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Artificial Neural Network Based Design Network For Dual Lateral Well Applications", "id": "15464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become an important tool for the petroleum industry, for performance analysis of reservoirs, because their ability of understanding highly non-linear relationships and its capacity to perform simulation studies in a rapid manner.  \nArtificial neural networks is a computational tool that is based on the way that the brain performs computations as it depends on knowledge based training strategies to build an experience in predicting the results of problem within the range of the trained cases.\nSince the increased use of natural gas all over the world, it has become more important to increase the gas production worldwide. Accordingly, many efforts have been expended to improve the production techniques such as using the multi-lateral wells which are capable to accomplish higher production rates.\n Determining the cumulative gas recovery profile, is an important step in the gas production characteristics, which presents the recovery performance through the well-life time which helps in detecting the well life-time and the revenue that can be realized after the detected well-life time. \nUsing the multi-lateral wells technique leads to increase the cumulative fluid recovery, decreases the environmental impacts and decreases the cost of drilling and completion.\nThe neural network developed in this study is able to predict the cumulative gas recovery profile from a tight shale gas reservoir with a multi-lateral well (dual horizontal well completion).\n In this study two artificial neural networks have been developed to achieve two main objectives.

They combine the expanse knowledge and information available on the Internet with local context made accessible through hardware features such as GPS receivers, microphones, cameras, and accelerometers. In the past several years, smartphone innovation and popularity has surged in response to more open programming interfaces and network capabilities. Underlying this valuable innovation lies increased security risk for users and providers of content and cellular service.\n\nIn this dissertation, we explore the limitations of existing mobile operating systems to protect end users from undesirable behavior by downloaded applications. Existing security frameworks define security policy in terms of permissions. We use requested permissions to focuses security analysis of available applications. First, we consider which permissions applications request and show that this limited information can prevent applications with dangerous functionality from being installed.  Second, we consider what applications do with permissions.  We design and build a framework for realtime dynamic taint analysis to identify misuse of information such as location and phone identifiers.  Finally, we consider what applications can do with permissions based on implemented functionality.

For the 1-D system we focus  on Riemann problems and interactions while for multi-D we consider  boundary value problems with spherical or cylindrical symmetry (which transforms the system into  1-D).  In 1-D we consider the full system, which includes the energy equation, and for multi-D we also consider isentropic flow. \n     In Chapter 1 we consider 1-D flow of ideal polytropic gases.  We resolve all but two possible interactions of elementary waves \n(shocks, contact discontinuities, and centered rarefactions). This has been done by several authors to varying degrees of completeness.  In addition to solving for the outgoing waves \nwe obtain various relations between strengths of incoming waves and outgoing waves.\n     As an application of resolving the interactions, we create \na specific interaction pattern by carefully choosing the initial\ndata which is done in Chapter 2. This  particular pattern is motivated by examples by Young and Jenssen for certain \nnon-physical systems for which the solution may blow up in sup-norm and/or total variation (for carefully chosen data). \nIn the case of the 1-D Euler system, the chosen data generates \ntwo contact discontinuities and repeated reflections of shocks between them. We also impose absorbing boundaries outside the central region in order to make the analysis tractable. \nBy  using the relations of the incoming waves and outgoing waves strengths, we are able to show that there will be only a finite number of interactions in any finite time interval and that all conserved quantities are uniformly bounded. This  gives that these special solutions of the full Euler system are defined for all time and are uniformly bounded. Further, we comment briefly on a particular scaling of the dependent variables in the Euler system. This provides a large data result for certain types of scaled up data.\n     Chapter 3 and Chapter 4  are devoted to the construction of stationary solutions of both the barotropic and  full, compressible Euler system in several space dimensions with spherical or cylindrical symmetry, for a general equation of state. For given Dirichlet data on a sphere or a cylinder we first construct smooth and radially symmetric solutions to the Euler equations in the exterior domain. On the other hand, stationary smooth solutions in the interior domain necessarily become sonic and cannot be continued beyond a critical inner radius. We then use these solutions to construct entropy-satisfying shocks for the Euler equations in the region between two concentric spheres (or cylinders).  In addition, for given data on the two concentric spheres (or cylinders) we investigate when a shock solution exists, and how the shock location is related to the boundary data.

New geochemical data provide insight into the thermochemical, isotopic, and mineralogical\ncharacteristics of the mantle beneath NE Egypt. The basalts are subalkaline with incompatible trace element abundances similar to those of ocean island basalts; their major element, trace element and isotopic geochemical features show little variation. They display rather flat primitive mantle-normalized incompatible trace element patterns, with notable positive Pb and negative P anomalies. Isotopic (143Nd/144Nd = 0.51274\u20130.51285, 87Sr/86Sr = 0.7049\u20130.7050) and trace element signatures (Ce/Pb = 16\u201322, Ba/Nb = 9\u201314, La/Nb = 0.9\u20131.0) are consistent with melting of a lithospheric source that has been slightly contaminated by continental crust during ascent and emplacement.

It becomes clear that environmental and situational complexity requires a reliance on teams to carry out response efforts. Crises, regardless of the type of event, require complex decision-making and planning under uncertainty within a high stress environment.  Furthermore, the complexities of crisis and disaster environments can be compounded by the cognitive complexities of diversity present in multinational teams or even in international response efforts.\nIn complex crisis management and disaster response environments, designing effective systems that facilitate teamwork and improve team cognition presents significant challenges, given the nature of crisis events as disruptive to infrastructure, communications, and everyday systems of life. Historically, the utilization of simulations to explore numerous concepts relevant to cognition in sociotechnical systems, such as teamwork, macrocognition, information sharing, hidden knowledge, common operational picture, decision making, planning, etc., has indicated their effectiveness for understanding phenomena in complex sociotechnical systems while maintaining a controlled, safe environment. NeoCITIES is a human-in-the-loop, scaled world simulation centered on emergency crisis response. In the current study, NeoCITIES was used to assess multicultural and national team cognition in complex environments.\nFrom an interdisciplinary perspective, the current study aimed to: 1) identify effective teamwork in crisis and disaster response, facilitating and improving effectiveness of human responses to these events and limiting loss of life and damage to communities; 2) develop the essential tools that will assist in effective crisis response, assisting both teams and individuals; 3) explore the impacts of culture background on cognitive processes, in order to facilitate team work in multicultural settings. \nThis study presents several major findings from a concurrent mixed methods study. Both quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches were utilized to assess cultural influences on team cognition in emergency crisis management scenarios. Namely this study identified differences in multinational team performance from national team performance on the NeoCITIES simulation task, and lower levels of information sharing overall and for hidden knowledge events by multinational teams. In addition to these findings, several approaches to teamwork in this setting, perspectives on cultural, and potential interventions for teamwork issues were identified qualitatively. Multiple methodological, theoretical, and practical implications of the current study were identified, with contributions made to the fields of Human Factors, Information Science, and Cognitive Systems Engineering.

When a material experiences a large change in temperature, its mechanical properties can change dramatically.  Furthermore, any sudden changes in temperature can adversely deform and stress the material such that failure occurs.  It is important to be able to monitor sudden changes in temperature in order to avoid these failures.  Often times in studies of thermal shock, the boundary condition at the surface is not known, and the direct solution is no longer useful.  However, the temperature must still be calculated.  These types of situations require an inverse method.  As its name implies, it is the opposite of the direct method.  Instead, the thermal response at some remote location is used to solve for the boundary condition at the surface. In this thesis, the inverse heat conduction problem was analyzed where the thermal conductivity was assumed to depend on temperature.  The inverse method was performed on a semi-infinite slab with an asymptotic exponential thermal surface loading with both increasing and decreasing conductivity.  A generalized direct solution was devised and analyzed.  The temperature was calculated symbolically in terms of unknown coefficients.  A thermal response was measured at a remote location, and the data was fit to the unknown coefficients using the least-squares method.   A finite element simulation was run as confirmation.  The inverse problem showed excellent agreement compared to the finite element model.  In addition to solving for surface temperature, the inverse method can also be used to solve for thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity.  The conductivity can be calculated using the inverse problem provided that the coefficients of the conductivity equation are at least on the order of one.  The same process was performed for the finite slab; however, due to complications in computation, the software used was unable to perform the inverse method.  However, the method is still conceptually valid and could be done with a more targeted approach.  Therefore, only the direct problem was analyzed for the finite slab.  Using a Taylor series approximation, good agreement was achieved between the analytical and finite element models.  After several seconds, this approximation would become very crude, as the analytical model would sharply diverge from the finite element model.  It was proven that an integral within the solution can be modeled as a constant several seconds into the transient analysis; this prevented the divergence that was caused by the Taylor series approximation.  The agreement between both the semi-infinite and finite slab models and their finite element counterparts improved as the thermal wave reached the point of interest more quickly. Given the versatility of the polynomials used in the cases presented, the method appears well suited for monotonic or mildly-oscillatory thermal scenarios provided the analysis is restricted to the time interval used to determine the polynomial.  In addition, the method can be adapted for any transcendental function, not necessarily polynomials, including periodic functions.

Retroviruses initially bud from infected cells as immature particles. The structural proteins are synthesized as the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. Concomitant with budding, the viral protease (PR) becomes active and cleaves Gag and Gag-Pol into the constituent proteins. Cleavage induces significant morphological changes to the interior of the virus, the most visually stunning aspect of maturation. Whereas the immature particle is roughly spherical, the mature virus contains a capsid of variable shape surrounding two copies of the viral positive-stranded RNA genome and associated proteins.\n\tThe mature capsid is made of the capsid protein (CA), which consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD). The mature capsid is made of a hexameric lattice of CA punctuated by 12 pentamers variably located. The best studied CA-CA interaction is the dimerization interface between two CTD molecules. The dimerization interaction holds neighboring hexamers together and is generated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between the 310 helix and the second alpha helix of the CTD (\u03b19). Further CTD-CTD stabilization is provided by the three-fold CTD interface which holds three hexamers together via the final alpha-helix (\u03b111).\n\tMuch less is understood about the immature Gag particle. The size and flexibility of the domains of Gag have precluded successful x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of Gag. The immature lattice is made exclusively of hexamers and forms spherical particles by insertion of gaps into the lattice. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of assembled truncated Gag molecules has provided models for immature assembly. The interhexameric dimerization interface is also present in immature particles but is predicted to look different than that of the mature capsid.\n\tUsing Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), we tested the new structural model of the immature interhexameric dimer interface by screening residues predicted to be at the interface. The failure of some of the alanine-substituted Gag proteins to assemble provides the strongest support to date that the current immature CTD dimer model is representative of the Gag lattice. Three of the mutants tested allowed Gag assembly but altered in vitro assembly of CA consistent with predictions from structural models. In total, these data support the hypothesis that the immature and mature dimers are different and regulated by distinct residues.\n\tA novel mature CTD-CTD interaction was recently described for the three-fold axis of symmetry. Mutagenesis of RSV T214, selected for its potential influence at several stages of retrovirus production, provided support that the residue is critical for assembly of the mature capsid. Alteration of capsid stability for T214 mutants and the location of the residue in the loop between \u03b110 and \u03b111 of the CTD are consistent with structural models of the mature three-fold interface.\n\tCA-SP, the capsid protein cleavage intermediate, assembled into the same types of particles as CA, albeit faster, and was able to nucleate CA assembly suggesting that CA-SP could be the first stage at which mature capsid assembly occurs. The intermediate may also serve as a nucleation point for capsid assembly. NMR analysis of the CTD-SP protein pointed to a potential close association between SP and the major homology region (MHR) and \u03b19 of the CTD. The interaction is consistent with mutagenesis of CA in which SP mutations are able to restore infectivity to non-infectious MHR mutant viruses and the identification of maturation inhibitor escape mutants in HIV-1 that map to MHR residues.\n\tReported maturation effects by MHR and SP mutations pointed to role for these two regions in maturation regulation. The results presented in this dissertation support a model in which the capsid protein intermediate CA-SP establishes mature contacts in an SP-mediated fashion. In this model, residues of SP transiently interact or closely associate with the MHR and \u03b19, causing slight conformational changes that break immature interactions and generate mature contacts in both the dimer and three-fold interface. By this mechanism, the entire CTD and SP coordinate with each other to regulate the outcome of maturation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10471], "author_name_tesi": "England, Matthew Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "England", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven", "Rebecca C Craven", "Sarah Bronson", "David Joseph Spector", "Fang Tian", "Jianming Hu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven, Dissertation Advisor", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Fang Tian, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Retrovirus", "capsid", "maturation", "assembly"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Local Experience: A Study of Two Pennsylvania Farm-to-restaurant Networks", "id": "23325", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10583", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As local food movements claim to provide improved environmental sustainability, community revitalization, and agricultural livelihoods, evaluation of the local food networks that they foster becomes all the more necessary.

To better explore this aspect of local food networks, this study examined how two farm-to-restaurant networks in central Pennsylvania (1) operate and distribute responsibilities and tasks among their participants, (2) are based on particular definitions for local in regard to food (3) produce benefits and drawbacks, as experienced or perceived by the participants. Using a case study approach, data was collected through semi-structured interviews with proprietors, selected kitchen and floor staff, and selected local food producers of two local-food restaurants in the central Pennsylvania community, one in a smaller, rural community, the other from a larger, more urban community. Other data collection methods included participant observation at each establishment and content analysis of restaurant materials and images, such as their menus and websites. Using frameworks borrowed from scholarship on agrifood systems and sustainability transitions, this study explored how the term local is applied and understood at multiple points across the farm-to-restaurant network, as well as the ways in which perceived benefits and drawbacks provide insight on the goals and motivations of the network participants in regard to food system change.

It was also found that across both farm-to-restaurant networks, participants\u2019 perceptions of benefits and drawbacks implied a more \u201csimple\u201d innovation niche orientation among the networks in regard to sustainability transitions, indicating that their intent was to create change at the local or community level, and not so much at the full system or regime level. The study results provided a greater understanding of the ramifications of local foods within farm-to-restaurant networks, as well as the orientation and motivations of these networks in regard to broader food system change and the applicability of sustainability transitions literature within alternative agrifood studies.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10223], "author_name_tesi": "Engle, Elyzabeth Whitney", "last_name_ssi": "Engle", "middle_name_ssi": "Whitney", "first_name_ssi": "Elyzabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Clare Hinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Clare Hinrichs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["local food", "farm-to-restaurant network", "sustainability innovation", "sustainability transition", "case study"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Black Hole Entropy, Constraints, and Symmetry in Quantum Gravity", "id": "7206", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses two major problems in the area of quantum gravity.  The first regards an extension of the statistical mechanical derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy from loop quantum gravity in [12].  Let us review what was accomplished in [12].  In [12], equilibrium black holes were modeled by isolated horizons.  We recall the following terminology: When the intrinsic geometry of an isolated horizon is spherically symmetric, we call it ``type I'.  When the intrinsic geometry of an isolated horizon is only axisymmetric, we call it\n``type II'.  The quantum geometry and entropy of \textit{type I} isolated horizons were investigated in [12].  The first part of this thesis generalizes the investigations in [12]\nto the type II case, thereby encompassing distortions and rotations of the horizon.  In particular, the leading term in the entropy\nof large horizons is again given by one fourth of the horizon area, using the \textit{same} value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter as was used in the type I case.\n\nThe second problem addressed in this thesis\nregards how to define `symmetric state'\nin quantum gravity (as well as quantum field theory more generally). The question is approached via a discussion on the relation between symmetry reduction before and after\nquantization of a field theory. A toy model field theory is used: the axisymmetric Klein-Gordon field.  We consider three possible notions\nof symmetry at the quantum level: invariance under the group action, and two notions derived from imposing symmetry as a system of constraints a la Dirac. One of the latter two turns out to be the most appropriate notion of\nsymmetry in the sense that it satisfies a number of physical criteria, including the commutativity of quantization and symmetry\nreduction.  Somewhat surprisingly, the requirement of invariance under the symmetry group action is <i>not</i> appropriate for this\npurpose. A generalization of the physically selected notion of symmetry to loop quantum gravity is presented and briefly discussed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2992], "author_name_tesi": "Engle, Jonathan Steven", "last_name_ssi": "Engle", "middle_name_ssi": "Steven", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Martin Bojowald", "Benjamin Owen", "Luen Chau Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Committee Chair", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member", "Benjamin Owen, Committee Member", "Luen Chau Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["loop quantum gravity", "black hole entropy", "symmetry reduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Feminist Considerations for Justice in Sport: A Conceptual and Philosophic Analysis of Reform", "id": "26686", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11791", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today\u2019s college sportsworld faces numerous charges of corruption ranging from educational dishonesty to blatant cheating. In this dissertation, I argue that the cause of these problems originates with hegemonic masculinity and the over-emphasis on winning present in intercollegiate athletics.

Female and male athletes have been marginalized and alienated because they did not meet the standards enforced by an athletic realm that celebrates achievements associated with a specific form of masculinity. \n\tTo tackle these issues, in this dissertation, I analyze the potential for sport reform through a feminist lens, one that recognizes the importance combating hypercompetitive attitudes and antecedent hegemonic masculinity. To do this, I look at philosophic and conceptual possibilities for reform. I argue that reformation can become a reality if we think about competition differently and modify behavior accordingly.  \n\tChapter 1 puts forth a definition of hegemonic masculinity and its place in sport. Chapter 2 historically contextualizes women\u2019s sport reform, providing a brief overview of women\u2019s physical education and intercollegiate athletics, with particular emphasis on efforts toward change. In Chapter 3, I review the literature highlighting potential sites for reform already identified by a number of sport philosophers. Chapter 4 justifies the need for reform in intercollegiate sport, drawing from research focused on the problems with college athletics and feminist ideals of sport. In Chapter 5, I develop and describe gender-neutral reforms for sport, that is, changes that should improve the sporting experience regardless of gender.\n\tThis dissertation proposes a conceptual and philosophic analysis of sport reform that is meant to challenge the current hegemonic model of sport, which thrives on exclusive forms of masculinity, and helps to create an interpretation of competition that is better for women and men.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11252], "author_name_tesi": "English, Colleen ", "last_name_ssi": "English", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Mark Dyreson", "Jessica Lynn Schultz", "Linda L Caldwell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member", "Jessica Lynn Schultz, Committee Member", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sport philosophy", "feminist philosophy", "sport reform"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE BRAIN RESPONSE TO FOOD PORTION SIZE AND ENERGY DENSITY IN 7-10 YEAR OLD CHILDREN", "id": "h128nd689", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12828", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tObesogenic food environments contain factors that encourage overconsumption, including large portion sizes (PS) of foods high in energy density (ED, kcal/g). However, the mechanisms underlying why and how large PS and high ED food cues promote excess energy intake remain unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the effects of food PS and ED. This study examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity in response to images of foods at two levels of PS (Large PS, Small PS) and two levels of ED (High ED, Low ED) using a block design in 7 \u2013 10 year old children. Results included: 1) both increased and decreased activity to large relative to small PS food cues in a brain region involved in inhibitory control; 2) both increased and decreased activity in response to high relative to low ED food cues in areas of the brain known to function in appetite regulation, reward-, and sensory-processing; and 3) parent-rated appetitive traits previously associated with higher body weight (i.e., greater food enjoyment, faster eating, and emotional overeating) were related to activity in appetitive brain regions when viewing large PS food cues. Collectively, our findings suggest that children may use brain mechanisms to process information about food PS cues that are different from those used to process ED cues, specifically in cognitive control areas compared to reward- and sensory-processing regions respectively. Additionally, how the brain responds to large portions may also be related to habitual eating behaviors. These studies are the first to report the brain response to food PS and ED in children.

As much of our knowledge about these compact objects comes from observation of astrophysical phenomena, Chapter 1 is devoted to the phenomena, and how they can be exploited as material property probes.  Several of the most interesting phenomena involve the enormous magnetic fields (B>10^12 gauss) harbored by many neutron stars, and the interaction between these fields and the charged particles within the solid crust.  Accordingly, Chapter 2 reviews some theory of strongly-magnetized electrons, which both sets the stage for Chapter 3, and (hopefully) serves as a useful reference for future research.  Let it now be made clear that this dissertation focuses exclusively on the ``outer crusts,'' of neutron stars, where no free neutrons are present (rho<4x10^11 g/cc), and the similarly-composed interiors of white dwarfs, which have central densities ~10^7 g/cc.  For the most part we specialize to even lower densities.\n\nIn Chapter 3, static and dynamic properties of low density (rho<10^6 g/cc) outer envelopes of neutron stars are calculated within the nonlinear magnetic Thomas-Fermi model, assuming degenerate electrons.  A novel domain decomposition enables proper description of lattice symmetry and may be seen as a prototype for the general class of problems involving nonlinear charge screening of periodic, quasi-low-dimensionality structures, e.g. liquid crystals.  We describe a scalable implementation of the method using Hypre.  Over the density range considered, the effective shear modulus appears to be a factor of approximately 20 larger than in the linearly-screened Coulomb crystal model, which could have implications for observables related to  astroseismology as well as low temperature phonon-mediated thermal conductivity.  Other findings include incipient c'<0 elastic instabilities for both bcc and fcc lattices, reminiscent of the situation in some light actinides, and suggestive of a symmetry-lowering transition to a tetragonal or orthorhombic lattice.\n\nChapter 4 describes a systematic search for multicomponent crystal structures, carried out for five different ternary systems of nuclei in a polarizable background of electrons, representative of accreted neutron star crusts and some white dwarfs.  Candidate structures are ``bred'' by a genetic algorithm, and optimized at constant pressure under the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi) charge screening.  Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight distinct crystal structures in the T=0 bulk phase diagrams, five of which are complicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of compact object astrophysics.  Frequent instances of geometrically similar but compositionally distinct phases give insight into structural preferences of systems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and extending to the regime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a laboratory.  As an application of these main results, we self-consistently couple the phase stability problem to the equations for a self-gravitating, hydrostatically stable white dwarf, with fixed overall composition.  To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate complex multinary phases into the equilibrium phase layering diagram and mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which are reported for He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs.  Finite thickness interfacial phases (``interphases'') show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc crystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than cubic.  A second application -- quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in white dwarfs -- builds on our equilibrium phase layering method.  Tests of this nonequilibrium method reveal extra phases which play the role of transient host phases for the settling species.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11491], "author_name_tesi": "Engstrom, Tyler Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Engstrom", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Tyler", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Benjamin Owen", "James Joseph Brannick", "George Pavlov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Benjamin Owen, Committee Member", "James Joseph Brannick, Committee Member", "George Pavlov, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neutron stars", "white dwarfs", "dense matter", "magnetic fields", "numerical methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "MIDDLE MIOCENE CLIMATE EVOLUTION IN THE PACIFIC REALM", "id": "6103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe goal of my dissertation has been to test hypotheses for the origins of high-latitude climatic warmth and the subsequent global cooling in the middle Miocene, aimed primarily at understanding the oceanographic evolution of the Pacific realm. I attempted to constrain the extent and magnitude of the middle Miocene \u201cclimatic optimum\u201d (MMCO; ca. 14.5-17 Ma) using oxygen and carbon stable isotopes of planktic and benthic foraminifers and nannofossils from deep-sea sites in the high-latitude South and North Pacific (ODP Sites 883, 1170, and 1172) and mollusk fossils from an onshore section in Kodiak Island, Gulf of Alaska. \n\tAt the subpolar North Pacific ODP 883, the d18O record suggests that the near-surface waters during the MMCO in the site were warmer than present by ~7-8\u00baC. Furthermore, the d18O data of fossil mollusks from Kodiak Island indicate that shallow-marine temperature of the northern Gulf of Alaska during the MMCO was higher than the modern sea-surface temperature by ~10\u00baC. These d18O-based paleotemperature estimates imply that a warm-temperate climatic regime prevailed in the subpolar North Pacific during the MMCO, in agreement with the previously reported paleoclimate reconstructions based on fossil assemblages of molluscan fauna. I speculate that the MMCO warmth in the high-latitude North Pacific was caused by increased poleward oceanic heat transport through northward redirection of tropical waters and intensified Kuroshio Current, primarily triggered by narrowing of the Indonesian Seaway in the western equatorial Pacific. In the southern high latitudes, paleotemperature reconstructions based on the d18O values of calcareous planktons at ODP Sites 1170 and 1172 off Tasmania suggest that near-surface waters in the subantarctic around the site paleo-locations were warmer than today by ~2\u00baC until about 14 Ma. The sea-surface temperatures were probably ameliorated by a warm current from the west that joined the circum Antarctic current. A decrease in the surface temperatures of 1~2\u00baC is recognized between ca. 14.5 and 12.5 Ma, offering direct evidence of the hypothesized middle Miocene cooling in the southern high latitudes in association with the intensified Antarctic circumpolar current. The benthic foraminiferal d13C record from Sites 883, 1170 and 1172, in conjunction with published records from other sites, suggest that northward advection of deepwater in the western Pacific persisted at least through the late early-middle Miocene. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [490], "author_name_tesi": "Ennyu, Atsuhito ", "last_name_ssi": "Ennyu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atsuhito", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur", "Lee Kump", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "Alan Walker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Chair", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paleoceanography", "paleoclimatology", "middle Miocene", "oxygen and carbon stable isotopes", "foraminifera", "Ocean Drilling Program"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Impact of Surgeon and Hospital Volume on Morality, Length of Stay, and Cost of Pancreaticoduodenectomy", "id": "21073", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Improved mortality rates following pancreaticoduodenectomy by high volume surgeons and hospitals have been well documented, but less is known about the impact of such volumes on length of stay and cost.

The addition of small concentrations of alloying elements prevents the\ncladding material from undergoing unstable oxide growth under the operating conditions of a nuclear\nreactor. Unstable oxide growth can also occur due to the presence of hydrides or exposure to neutron flux.\nThe role of alloying elements in avoiding the transition from stable to unstable growth is examined in this\nthesis. The goal is to determine the mechanism whereby oxide stabilization occurs.\nTo accomplish this goal, a variety of experiments were performed, and the resulting oxide layers\ncharacterized with various techniques. Ten model Zr alloys were fabricated and tested in furnace at 600\u00b0C\nfor 40 hours in oxygen and in autoclave at 360\u00b0C for up to 70 days to determine the causes of breakaway\noxidation in pure Zr (and Zr alloys with small concentrations of alloying elements) and the role that alloying\nelements play in causing this phenomenon. These alloys were carefully selected and included crystal bar\nZr, sponge Zr, and alloys with small concentrations of Sn, Fe, and Cr. After testing, the alloys were\ncharacterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and synchrotron \u03bc-X-ray\nfluorescence (\u03bcXRF) to determine how the structure of the oxide, tetragonal phase content, and alloying\nelement distribution affected the formation of unstable oxide. Heterogeneous distribution of alloying\nelements was linked to regions of unstable oxide (either nodule-like, grain boundary penetration, or\ndifferential grain-to-grain growth) and hypothesized to cause breakaway corrosion.\nThe examination of stable oxide layers was then used as a baseline for comparison to cases of\nunstable oxide growth in Zr and Zr alloys. One of the primary modes of examination of stable oxide layers\nformed on Zr alloys was microbeam synchrotron X-ray radiation diffraction and fluorescence, performed\nat the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. This synchrotron X-ray source was\nused to perform \u03bc-X-ray diffraction (\u03bcXRD), \u03bcXRF, and 3D Laue spectroscopy. The \u03bcXRD technique was\nused to determine the oxide layer phase content, strain, and grain size as a function of corrosion temperature\nand oxide thickness. The \u03bcXRF technique was used to perform Fe X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy\niv\n(XANES) to determine the oxidation state of Fe in the metal as a function of distance from the metal-oxide\ninterface for various corrosion temperatures. The 3D Laue spectroscopy technique was used to determine\nplastic deformation and elastic strain in the metal as a function of distance from the metal-oxide interface,\ncorrosion temperature, and oxide thickness for crystal bar Zr and Zircaloy-4.\nAdditionally, Zircaloy-4 samples were corroded in autoclave at 360\u00b0C for up to 2804 days in and\nwere periodically weighed to determine oxide thickness. These samples had different coupon thicknesses\nthat altered the surface-to-volume ratio and led to a higher concentration of hydrogen for a given amount\nof oxide layer growth. The concentration of hydrogen was measured in archived samples to determine the\neffect of hydrogen concentration on corrosion rate. It was observed that the corrosion rate of Zircaloy-4\nincreased with increasing hydrogen concentration above the terminal solid solubility (TSS) of the material\n(and thus the precipitation of hydrides). More hydrogen caused earlier kinetic transition and areas of\nadvanced oxide growth were associated with the locations of hydrides in the metal. It was hypothesized\nthat the hydrides hardened the metal ahead of the interface and that the metal was then less able to\naccommodate oxide growth stresses leading to earlier kinetic transition and mechanical cracking of the\noxide.\nFinally, eleven Zircaloy-4 samples exposed to various temperatures (272-355\u00b0C) and neutron flux\nlevels (0-11.48 x 1013 n/cm2/s, E > 1 MeV) were examined using \u03bcXRD and \u03bcXRF to determine the effect\nof irradiation on oxide grain size, phase content, and the oxidation of Fe at the APS. With increasing neutron\nfluence, the grain size of the oxide increased, leading to less tetragonal phase in the oxide away from the\nmetal-oxide interface. At the metal-oxide interface, higher amounts of tetragonal phase were observed with\nincreasing neutron fluence. This could be caused by the redistribution of Fe from second phase particles\n(SPPs) into the matrix or due to the hardening of the Zr matrix caused by the exposure to neutrons.\nThe cases of unstable oxide growth examined here were linked to both the distribution and presence\nof alloying elements in Zr and Zr alloys and to the level of stress in the oxide. These two phenomena appear\nto be the primary causes leading to regions of advanced oxide growth and careful consideration should be\ngiven to them when designing and using future Zr alloys in advanced nuclear reactor concepts.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13616], "author_name_tesi": "Ensor, Brendan Melvin", "last_name_ssi": "Ensor", "middle_name_ssi": "Melvin", "first_name_ssi": "Brendan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Michael Tonks", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Allison Michelle Beese", "Ashley Lucente", "John Seidensticker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Dissertation Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Michael Tonks, Committee Member", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Member", "Allison Michelle Beese, Outside Member", "Ashley Lucente, Special Member", "John Seidensticker, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zirconium", "zirconium alloy", "fuel cladding", "corrosion", "synchrotron radiation", "X-ray diffraction", "XANES", "neutron irradiated", "Zircaloy-4", "hydrogen", "breakaway oxidation", "strain", "stress", "plastic deformation", "oxide growth", "X-ray fluorescence", "Raman spectroscopy", "tetragonal fraction", "grain size"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "High-Speed Access over Copper Wiring", "id": "10174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4482", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on conceptual design, development and demonstration of a 40 Gigabits per second (Gbps) transmission system for distribution of a digital signal over Ethernet\ncopper cables serving ultra high-speed interconnection in e.g. data centers, local area networks (LAN), consumer multimedia, teleconferencing, telemedicine, and many others. Although the actual implementation may not be feasible at the time of writing this dissertation due to technology limitations and high production costs, we have been trying to address the analysis, modeling and design of sub-systems in a framework leading to a practical implementation of beyond 10G, namely 40Gbps, in a not too distant future with the ever increasing speed of technology advances.\nIn the commercial market, a new challenge is the extension of fiber into the access network in small business and dense metropolitan areas. It has long been known that a major bottleneck in delivering multimedia services to the computer users is the low-capacity of LANs.\nWith ever-increasing demand for higher capacities, the need for broadband access is transformed from a convenience into a necessity. So far, data communication has been the main driving force behind increased traffic on the communications networks. To keep up with this explosive growth, ultra high-capacity networks were required, and thus optical networks with terabit capacities dominated the network core. To enable the end user to take full advantage of this core, reliable high-speed LAN access is required. Providing service in a broadband access LAN, using a copper cable approach, has the advantages of the network being highly-dependable and cost-effective.\nThis will benefit the providers of service over campus settings like hospitals, industry compounds or universities with facilities spread over several buildings that a quick service upgrade could extend new service offerings.

Researchers have started to study the technical\nfeasibility, broad market potential, and economic feasibility of speeds beyond 10Gbps over\ncopper. In this dissertation, we evaluate the possibility of 40Gbps data transmission (40GBASET) over horizontal balanced CAT-7A cables up to a distance of 50 meters. The objective of IEEE 40GBASE-T is to create an application that is capable of transporting data at a rate of 40Gbps over at least 10 meters of copper cable. Our capacity analysis of this cable shows that 40Gbps transmission is practical up to 50m over this cable at the cost of elaborate digital signal processing and complex coding schemes. Besides, the data center geography statistics show that 80~90% of links are shorter than 45m. Accordingly, by the aid of upcoming new fast and low power CMOS technologies, we consider designing a system for 40Gbps transmission over 50m CAT-7A cable.\nFrom a signal processing standpoint, 40Gbps applications on copper have two main\ndisadvantages:\n\u2022 Computational complexities are substantially increased.\n\u2022 Circuits require significant innovations in analog mixed-signal design, and DSP\ndesign.\n\nIn this dissertation, we discuss methods and algorithms that can contribute to alleviate\nthese problems. The main contribution of this dissertation is in the technical feasibility\nassessment and system design for a data rate of 40Gbps over copper wire. We start by multi-input\nmulti-output (MIMO) modeling and present formulas for capacity bounds. These bounds are\ngood performance measures for a channel impaired by background noise and crosstalk signals.\nWe also prove, by means of multiple access channel theorem, that single-input single-output\n(SISO) implementation will perform as well as MIMO implementation and this is due to low farend\ncrosstalk (FEXT) level in CAT-7 cables. We used the specification of CAT-7A cable, an\nenhanced version of CAT-7 with a better performance and engineering design, to analyze, model and finally optimize the parameters for the given system requirements. We also consider a more elaborate pulse shaping filter than regular zero-ISI raised-cosine filters. Different equalization and precoding methods are evaluated. Finally multi-dimensional trellis and Low-density parity-check codes are considered as potential candidates for channel coding. We designed a low-power, lowlatency LDPC assisted coded modulation which can provide coding gains up to 6dB, sufficient to satisfy the required constraints in terms of system margin and error probability. With some optimization algorithms, we came up with an idea to substantially reduce the power through multichannel data transmission.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4452], "author_name_tesi": "Enteshari, Mohammad Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Enteshari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mohammad Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "Mohsen Kavehrad", "John Douglas Mitchell", "Ali R Hurson", "William C Waterhouse"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Dissertation Advisor", "Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "John Douglas Mitchell, Committee Member", "Ali R Hurson, Committee Member", "William C Waterhouse, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ethernet", "Category cable", "Capacity", "Equalization", "crosstalk cancellation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of the Efficacy of Advanced Well Structures in Unconventional Multi-phase Reservoirs", "id": "23825", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10899", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advanced well structures have continued to see an increase in use and field application, particularly for unconventional reservoirs.  Advances in such fields as geo-steering, directional drilling, and measurement while drilling, have enabled the possibility of constructing wells with different kinds of configuration and extended reach. These wells are constructed to increase contact with the reservoir, thus enhancing productivity whilst reducing surface footprint by the ability to access isolated productive zones. The complexity of these well structures makes it an arduous task to develop analytical models to predict performance. Traditional methods for well performance analyses barely capture the complex interactions between these well structures and the reservoir.\n\nIn this study, artificial expert systems using artificial neural networks are designed and developed for various tasks involving advanced well structures in unconventional multi-phase reservoirs.   Artificial expert systems have the ability to learn information that exists between a pair of input and output without necessarily being encumbered by the need for knowledge of the physics of the relationship between the pair. These systems establish functional correlations betwen the input and output of any system that can subsequently be used to estimate the response of the system, given a new input.\n\nThree sets of artificial expert systems have been developed in this study that reflect the conventional needs of the industry. The Production Performance Expert System (PPEx) is developed to predict the performance of advanced well structures in tight oil reservoirs given that some knowledge of the reservoir properties is available. The Well Design Expert System (WDEx) is developed to predict a possible advanced well structure that can meet a desired production target given that some knowledge of the reservoir properties is available. This can be seen as working in the inverse direction of the PPEx system. The WDEx system is particularly useful in the field development planning stage of any project.  The History Matching Expert System (HMEx) is developed to predict possible values of reservoir properties given an advanced well structure and its production profiles. This can also be seen as working in the inverse direction of the PPEx system. The HMEx system is important for better characterization of the reservoir.\n\nThese three sets of expert systems are ultimately combined in such a fashion that makes each one complementary to the other.  Once combined, this tool becomes a useful and relatively inexpensive means for quick and efficient analyses of advanced well structures available to the reservoir engineer.  The developed models show good performances as seen in results of various tests applied.  Generalization test results for the PPEx systems show average prediction error of 8%.  Similar results are obtained for other expert systems.  These results lend credence to the application of artificial intelligence for such complex wellbore and reservoir systems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10489], "author_name_tesi": "Enyioha, Chukwuka ", "last_name_ssi": "Enyioha", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chukwuka", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Yilin Wang", "Daniel Kifer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Daniel Kifer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Unconventional", "advanced well structures", "artificial intelligence", "production prediction", "field development", "history matching"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Friction, Fiction, and Failure: Scientifically Based Research and the Rural ", "id": "8025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3387", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Educational Science Reform Act of 2002 and No Child Left Behind define experimental studies as the preferred method to produce knowledge about schools, learning, and teaching.

In this research, spent mushroom compost (SMC), a sustainable, inexpensive, and abundant byproduct of the mushroom industry, was analyzed for its ability to support the remediation of soil contaminated by a diesel fuel spill. Chitin, a nitrogen-rich polymer derived from crab shell material, was also investigated as a nutrient amendment to counteract the nitrogen loss commonly observed in petroleum-contaminated soils. The approach was tested on contaminated soil and SMC obtained from the California Mushroom Farm, Inc. The results of this study will be used to guide the implementation of aerobic composting for remediation of diesel-contaminated soil at the site. Sacrificial batch microcosm tests were used to evaluate the effect of substrate/nutrient addition and elevated temperatures on the rate of diesel total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) remediation in a series of two experimental phases. In Phase I, the conditions evaluated were soil + SMC, soil + SMC with crab-shell chitin, and soil only (control). In Phase II, TPH removal was monitored at three temperatures typically encountered during composting: 22 oC, 30 oC, and 50 oC. In Phase I, all substrate-amended microcosms were successful at diesel removal. Microcosms amended with SMC and chitin showed an advantage at various points throughout treatment but did not enhance overall TPH remediation when compared to microcosms amended with SMC only. In Phase II, microcosms showed different TPH removal trends at early times depending on temperature, but overall, it was determined that none of the various temperature conditions provided an advantage for remediation. After 160 days, TPH concentrations in microcosms were reduced from approximately 1600 to 210 ppm at 22 oC, 180 ppm at 30 oC, and 270 at 50 oC for removals of 87%, 89%, and 83%, respectively.  \nDenaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) was conducted using universal bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers to characterize the microbial community at different points during treatment. A diverse community was shown to be present in all conditions and time points analyzed. Preferential enrichment of specific community members or hydrocarbon degraders was not found. Functional overlap by various species breaking down the organic material in the system may be responsible for hydrocarbon degradation as well. \nComposting treatment of diesel contaminated soil using SMC from The California Mushroom Farm was compared to similar treatments using other locally available low cost waste substrates. SMC from The Pennsylvania State University Mushroom Testing Demonstration Facility and sewage sludge-based compost from The University Area Joint Authority (UAJA) Wastewater Treatment Plant promoted the highest TPH removal, CO2 production, and O2 usage as compared to The California Mushroom Farm SMC. The highest TPH removal (43%) was observed in microcosms containing Penn State SMC. This enhanced performance is probably linked to the higher carbon and nitrogen contents available in UAJA compost and Penn State SMC per dry mass as compared to The California Mushroom Farm SMC. \nThe results of this study demonstrate that SMC can serve as an effective compost amendment to treat weathered, diesel-contaminated soil. Additionally, several other readily available waste substrates can be utilized in this type of low cost, low energy remediation system. Optimal conditions for microbial growth and activity, particularly sufficient O2 and moisture, should be provided at the onset of treatment and monitored actively throughout the course of remediation to ensure maximum hydrocarbon degradation. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [123], "author_name_tesi": "Eramo, Alessia Giuseppina", "last_name_ssi": "Eramo", "middle_name_ssi": "Giuseppina", "first_name_ssi": "Alessia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan", "Rachel Alice Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["composting", "bioremediation", "spent mushroom compost", "diesel fuel", "soil contamination"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Linking Child Social Anxiety and Peer Maladjustment: Social-Cognitive and Social-Behavioral Factors", "id": "7135", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5473", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study aimed to advance understanding of social-cognitive and social-behavioral vulnerabilities to peer maladjustment among middle school children with elevated social anxiety.

The breadth of the expression system was tested with several membrane proteins from distinct families including Cytochrome-cy from Rhodobacter capsulatus; GhoT from Escherichia coli; human Occludin; human AQP9, a human water channel protein; BcsAB complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and finally R. sphaeroides RsAqpZ.

Therefore, it has applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. Currently, egg white lysozyme is the most commercially available form of lysozyme. However, it has disadvantages compared to human lysozyme, such cause of allergic reactions and its lower enzymatic activity. Therefore, human lysozyme gene was expressed in many host cells. Kluyveromyces lactis K7 is a genetically modified microorganism, which can produce human lysozyme, has effective secretory capacity, which can provide high production and easiness for recovery processes. For high production, reactor design, fermentation conditions and strategies should be considered. Biofilm type reactor can enhance the production by high cell density in the reactor. In this study, a biofilm reactor with plastic composite support (PCS) was used in different fermentation modes to enhance the production of human lysozyme by K. lactis K7. \n\nFirst, the best composition of PCS, which included polypropylene (50% (w/w)), soybean hulls (35%), soybean flour (5%), yeast extract (5%), and dried bovine albumin (5%), salts (2 g/kg of sodium acetate, 1.2 g/kg of MgSO4\u20227H2O, and 0.06 g/kg of MnSO4\u20227H2O), was selected for human lysozyme production. Then, a novel biofilm bioreactor configuration was implemented with selected PCS tubes. The optimum growth conditions for biomass and lysozyme productions in a biofilm reactor were determined as 27 degree Celsius, pH 6, 1.33 vvm for biomass production and 25 degree Celsius, pH 4 with no aeration for lysozyme production (Chapter 3). After, the evaluation of different pH and aeration shift strategies, 141 U/ml of human lysozyme production was achieved with a gradual pH decrease by auto-acidification at 25\u00b0C without aeration control (Chapter 3). \n\nThen, the fermentation medium composition was evaluated. NaCl and NH4Cl inhibited the biomass and human lysozyme production. Yeast nitrogen base was selected as the best nitrogen source compared to yeast extract and corn steep liquor. As a result of medium optimization, the production increased to 173 U/ml using the fermentation medium including 16% lactose, 1.2% casamino acid, and 0.8% yeast nitrogen base. Biofilm reactor provided both higher production and production rate (173 U/ml and 4.07 U/ml/h) compared to the suspended-cell fermentation (110.3 U/ml and 2.00 U/ml/h) because of the increase in the cell density in the reactor (Chapter 4). Then, fed-batch fermentation with 90 g/l glucose and feeding with 400 g/l lactose at a feeding rate of 0.6 ml/min at between 28 and 38 h increased the production amount and the rate further (187 U/ml, 5.9 U/ml/h). Continuous fermentation also enhanced the production rate (7.5 U/ml/h). Moreover, the biofilm reactor provided operation at the maximum level at a higher dilution rate (0.055 h-1 dilution rate) compared to a suspended-cell reactor (0.04 h-1 dilution rate) because of the immobilized cells in the biofilm reactor (Chapter 5). \n\nAdsorption and desorption conditions were studied using silicic acid resin for the simultaneous fermentation and online recovery of human lysozyme (Chapter 6). At 25oC, pH 4, and 25% silicic acid ratio adsorption was 95.6%, while desorption at 25 degree Celsius, pH 6.2 with 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 M NaCl and 20% ethanol as the eluent resulted in 42% desorption. Desorption up to 98% was achieved by four consecutive desorption processes. Using these selected recovery conditions, a simultaneous fermentation and online recovery system with tangential flow microfilter module generated 280.4 U/ml of human lysozyme. \n\nThe stability of lysozyme was evaluated during the storage of produced lysozyme at the room temperatures or below before downstream processing. A three factor Box-Behnken design was used to document the effects of the combination of pH, temperature, and time (Chapter 7). Results indicated that the lysozyme activity in the cell free fermentation medium was stable at the temperatures evaluated (4, 10, and 25 degree Celsius) during 30 days of storage. Also, the human lysozyme activity was highest at 25 degree Celsius, but decreased at 62.5 degree Celsius and 100 degree Celsius at all pH levels. \n\nFinally, primary models were built to describe the batch fermentation of human lysozyme production by K. lactis K7 in a biofilm reactor (Chapter 8). The model that best described the biomass production was the modified Logistic model with 0.99 R2 and 0.046 RMSE (Root Mean Square Error). Both human lysozyme production and lactose consumption were described well with the modified Gompertz model (0.99 R-square and 7.1 RMSE for human lysozyme production and 0.99 R-square and 3.4 RMSE for lactose consumption). \n\nIn conclusion, these studies demonstrated that the biofilm reactor enhanced the production of human lysozyme by K. lactis K7.

MATa cells choose HML&#945; for recombination and MAT&#945; cells choose HMRa. This is called \u201cdonor preference\u201d and controlled by the recombination enhancer (RE). Donor preference during mating-type switching has been attributed to differences in chromatin structure for the left arm of chromosome III. I mapped the structure of ~45 kbp of the left arm of chromosome III in a and alpha cells in logarithmically growing cultures and in a cells during switching. Other than the RE, chromatin structure was identical in the two cell types. Changes in chromatin structure during switching were confined to RE and HML. My analysis indicates that primary chromatin structure does not cause the documented differences in recombinational frequency of the left arm of chromosome III in a and &#945; cells. \n\nIn the process of addressing the role of chromatin in mating type switching, I carried out the first study of chromatin structure spanning an extensive region in an organism whose genomic sequence is known. This region includes thirty ORFs, six potential replication origins, two known silencers and a recombination enhancer, thus may serve as a representative of overall genome organization. Significant features of organized chromatin exist for the entire region. DNase I hypersensitive sites reside at the promoter region of nearly every gene, suggesting that a basic chromatin structural feature exists at every promoter. ~25% of the ORFs possess extended regions of positioned nucleosomes. My study on the chromatin structure of an extended region contributes to understanding how yeast organizes its primary chromatin structure.\n\nA number of a-specific non-coding RNAs are transcribed from the RE locus, downstream of the two &#945;2/Mcm1 operators. This transcription is cell cycle regulated. Additionally, proper mating-type switching and donor preference require a cell-cycle regulated factor. Mcm1 and Fkh1 regulate RE activity in a cells. Mcm1 binding is required for both RE transcription and Fkh1 binding. This requirement can be bypassed by inserting another promoter into the RE, which increases donor preference and opens the chromatin structure of RE. The data presented in this thesis suggest that the role of Mcm1 in a-cell donor preference is to activate RE by providing a promoter-related function such as recruiting the chromatin remodeling proteins and/or other transcription factors. Transcription activation and open chromatin enhances Fkh1 binding and the level of this binding determines the level of donor preference. My study on RE activation helps understanding the mechanism of RE function in increasing the rate of recombination between HML and MAT.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5934], "author_name_tesi": "Ercan, Sevinc ", "last_name_ssi": "Ercan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sevinc", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

Immanuel Kant, thinker of the Enlightenment par excellence, is widely considered no enthusiast of rhetoric.  In Critique of Judgment Kant claims that oratory deserves no respect whatsoever.  However, he immediately retracts that dramatic pronouncement in a footnote that distinguishes bad rhetoric (manipulative oratory that evacuates the listener\u2019s ability to use his or her own judgment) from good rhetoric (defined as the combination of eloquence and well-spokenness), where sufficient influence on the mind can be effected without the machinery of persuasion.  Without such a distinction, a curious enigma emerges: how can a thinker reject rhetoric while defining enlightenment as the public exercise of reason, at every point? \n \nExamining Kant\u2019s complicated and conflicted attitudes towards rhetoric requires looking beyond the curt dismissal in the third Critique and to his extensive commentary on not only rhetoric but several related themes that cut across his popular and critical philosophy more broadly.  This project does just that in examining Kant\u2019s comments, across a broad swath of his works, on a constellation of topics related to rhetoric such as eloquence, the persuasion/conviction distinction, rhetoric\u2019s relation to poetry and philosophy, and his sustained interest in the notion of popularity in philosophy.   Furthermore, rhetoric plays a role in Kantian ethics, particularly the emphasis in his anthropological ethics on conversation and sociable exchange to better the mind through the body.  In Kantian aesthetics, the crucial role of reflective judgment and the orientation of \u201ccritique\u201d\u2014especially the important turn it takes in the Critique of Judgment\u2014was in no small part actually influenced by British rhetorical and aesthetic theory.  Kant also wrote extensively on style, fashioning his own stylistic orientation that emphasizes balancing both the logical and aesthetic, producing a natural style that effaces itself, and that is suitable to the writer, audience, and occasion (rather than merely following fashion).  In examining Kant\u2019s \u201cWhat is Enlightenment\u201d in the context of these themes, an important if not central role for rhetoric in enlightenment, and Kantian philosophy more broadly, emerges.  \n&#8195;\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2046], "author_name_tesi": "Ercolini, Gina L.", "last_name_ssi": "Ercolini", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Gina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Howard Browne", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Thomas Walter Benson", "Rosa A Eberly", "Debra Hawhee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Howard Browne, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Chair", "Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Member", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Debra Hawhee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Communication", "History of Rhetoric", "Rhetoric and Philosophy", "Immanuel Kant", "Ethics", "Enlightenment"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Oligopoly Models of Investment Behavior", "id": "7075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1907", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three chapters on dynamic oligopoly models. In the first chapter, I emphasize the importance of strategic\nbehavior by entrants. I provide a model of endogenous entry in which potential entrants can influence their product quality in the entry\nstage by varying the level of sunk investments they make at the time of entry. If the entrants are allowed to influence the distribution\nof quality in their favor, I demonstrate that they act strategically and their decisions depend on the market structure, i.e., the state\nvector of the incumbents. Whenever the industry consists of firms with low quality goods, entrants invest substantially and vice versa.\n\nIn the second chapter, I focus on the effects of import competition on the investment incentives and the productivity of domestic firms.\nFirm-and plant-level empirical studies typically find that trade liberalization squeezes price-cost margins among import-competing firms, that this heightened competitive pressure induces\nproductivity gains among these same firms, and that further efficiency gains come from market share reallocations. Using a computable industrial evolution model to simulate the dynamic\neffects of import competition, we explore what types of managerial behavior, long-term transition paths and welfare effects are\nconsistent with this set of stylized facts.\n\nIn the third chapter, I analyze the linkages between entry costs, firms' investment incentives in oligopolistic markets and welfare. Policy makers argue that high entry costs create significant economic inefficiencies in perfectly competitive markets. Hence, it is argued that policies that promote entry can improve welfare.\nHowever, the response in an oligopolistic market is not clear. Increased entry can potentially discourage investments and lead to a welfare loss in the long run. In this study, I analyze empirically how policies that lower entry costs affect welfare and find evidence that such policies might lead to a welfare loss. To do this\nanalysis, first, I develop a structural industrial evolution model with strategic interactions in which firms choose prices in the\nstatic game and enter, exit, and invest in the dynamic game, subject to uncertainty and idiosyncratic shocks. Then, I estimate the\nparameters of both the static and the dynamic game for the Colombian engines and turbines industry. The estimation recovers the demand\nand cost parameters as well as the investment costs and scrap value and sunk entry cost distributions. I then simulate the model to\nanalyze the effects of sunk entry costs on the investment behavior and the strategic use of investments. I find that lower sunk entry\ncosts lead to a decrease in welfare by reducing incentives to invest. The industry is dominated by high-cost firms which charge higher prices.

However, it has become increasing beneficial to run some hydroturbines at conditions that are significantly different than BEP. This is a direct result of volatile price fluctuations on the electric market, limited storage capabilities, and environmental rules and regulations. Running the hydroturbine at off-design conditions can result in a significant amount of residual swirl in the draft tube. The presence of this residual swirl is particularly detrimental to the performance of Francis hydroturbines since they rely on a pressure head to generate power.\n\nPrevious research at The Pennsylvania State University numerically discovered that injecting water through the trailing edge of the wicket gates could change the bulk flow direction upstream of the runner blades. In this manner, the flow rate and swirl angle entering the runner blade could be altered to limit residual swirl in the draft tube. The research determined that properly tuned jets could result in a significant improvement in turbine efficiency when the hydroturbine was operating at low flow. However, this required pumping water through channels into a region of relatively high pressure. This pump requirement lessened the effectiveness of the wicket gate trailing edge injection.\n\nThe concept of water jet injection was further explored in the present work. However, instead of injecting water into a region of relatively high pressure, water jets were placed at the trailing edge of the runner blades where there is a region of relatively low pressure. It was determined that, although this water jet injection improved the off-design efficiency at 77% of the BEP flow rate by 0.8%, the hydroturbine now required a 9.3% larger head in order to maintain the flow rate. Thus, this technique would be useful only in unique cases. For example, decreased swirl in the draft tube can potentially decrease vibration and losses associated with a spiraling vortex rope. (Note that the simulations here were steady state and did not account for such unsteadiness.) The present work found no increase in efficiency for the high flow case (115% of the BEP flow rate) with the added water jet injection technique. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11885], "author_name_tesi": "Erdman, Matthew D", "last_name_ssi": "Erdman", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Cimbala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Cimbala, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydropower", "Draft tube", "Water jet"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "MODELING OF DISPERSED FLOW FILM BOILING WITH TWO FLOW, FIVE FIELD EULERIAN- EULERIAN APPROACH AND EFFECTS OF SPACER GRIDS ON HEAT TRANSFER ", "id": "7000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5941", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the case of a postulated loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in a nuclear reactor, an accurate prediction of clad temperature is needed to determine the safety margins. The large break LOCA analyses can be divided in to three time periods. These periods are blowdown, refill and reflood. During the blowdown and reflood phases of the LOCA, when the local void fraction is greater than 80 % and the wall is at a temperature above minimum film boiling temperature (Tmin), heat is transferred from the fuel rod to a continuous vapor flow with dispersed droplets. The high void fraction mixture of droplets and vapor provide cooling to prevent the clad temperature from exceeding the safety limit. The heat transfer process for high void fraction mixture is called dispersed flow film boiling (DFFB). This thesis has been modeled DFFB in the reflood phase of a LOCA in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) rod bundle. \nIn this study, the modifications and modification requirements for the COBRA-TF code to obtain a five field Eulerian - Eulerian modeling for two-phase DFFB is described. COBRA-TF is a best estimate code developed for the rod bundle analysis and has four fields, namely, vapor, entrained drop and continuous liquid film. COBRA-TF has a detailed reflood package which takes effect of spacer grids on heat transfer into account. This study has a detailed description of code\u2019s solution scheme and the models used for dispersed flow film boiling.\nThe dispersed flow film boiling heat transfer model of the COBRA-TF code has been modified by adding a small droplet field to the code as the fifth field. The effect of smaller, thermally more active droplets on heat, mass and momentum transfer during DFFB has been modeled. \nSince the large drop break up due to spacer grids is one of the reasons for small droplet generation, the spacer grid models of the COBRA-TF have been revised and modified. In addition to small droplet generation, the spacer grid rewet is an important aspect of heat transfer during DFFB. Since wet spacer grids provide a large interfacial area for the heat transfer between the superheated vapor and the liquid deposited on the spacer grid, the grid rewet has been modeled and effect of wet grid on heat transfer has been investigated.\nAdding a new field to the code not only requires adding new equations and models to the code but also makes changes in existing equations and models necessary. The changes in currently existing field equations and closure relations such as entrainment model have been described in this study.\nOnce the code modifications are performed, the code evaluation with proper experimental data has been presented. The rod bundle reflood experiments have been selected, described and code modeling for these experiments have been introduced. Reflood experiments during which DFFB exists have been selected from Full Length Emergency Core Heat Transfer-System Effects and Separate Effects Tests (FLECHT-SEASET) and Rod Bundle Heat Transfer (RBHT) experiments for the evaluation.\nThe results of the code evaluations have been presented by comparing the experimental data with the results of code simulations performed with original and modified code. Measurements and calculations for the heater rod, vapor and grid temperatures and quench front progression have been compared.\nWith the new smaller droplet field, the rod to flow heat transfer, the vapor velocity, interfacial heat and mass transfer, droplet mass and volume distribution, i.e., the thermal and mechanical non-equilibrium between the continuous vapor and dispersed droplet phases has been modeled accurately. This is an important improvement over the dispersed flow film boiling model of the original code. The results of the analysis performed with the modified code have been indicated improvement in code predictions for the rod surface temperature, vapor temperature and quench front behavior. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5935], "author_name_tesi": "Ergun, Sule ", "last_name_ssi": "Ergun", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sule", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lawrence E Hochreiter", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Cengiz Camci", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lawrence E Hochreiter, Committee Chair", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["two phase flow modeling", "dispersed flow film boiling", "spacer grids", "COBRA-TF"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PEDOGENIC FATE AND TRANSPORT OF TOTAL MERCURY ACROSS SUBAERIAL AND SUBAQUEOUS SOILS IN AN APPALACHIAN PLATEAU IMPOUNDMENT", "id": "11513", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1798", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new field of soil science classifies plant-supporting materials undergoing pedogenesis in up to 2.5 m of water as subaqueous soil (SAS).

The distribution of Hg and SOC (with which Hg is commonly associated) was determined across a hydrosequence, including SASs, in the Black Moshannon Lake watershed. Both Hg and SOC accumulation and transport were greatly influenced by soil drainage, organic matter content, and the presence of a fragipan. SOC pools increased with wetness, and were greatest in SASs, while Hg pools decreased with wetness, indicating a loss of Hg to the aquatic system and likely Hg methylation.

These tools have also opened up opportunities for organizations to connect with new sources of innovation to supplement or replace current practices. Reaching out to new sources of productivity, knowledge, and creativity via social media is commonly referred to as \u201ccrowdsourcing.\u201d Each day, organizations are turning to the crowd to complete a wide variety of tasks. However, we currently know little about the motivations of these organizations, the types of tasks that are completed, the characteristics of the crowd that may be best suited to complete different tasks, and the organizational challenges and risks that such outreach creates. \n\nUsing grounded theory methods and qualitative data from literature and case studies, the goal in this research was to build a clearer understanding of the uses of crowdsourcing by established organizations with respect to innovation. This research contributes to theory in three key ways. First, it defines four common organizational uses of crowdsourcing, specifically: 1) Marketing/Branding, 2) Cost Reduction/Productivity 3) Product/Service Innovation, and 4) Knowledge Capture. This finding extends theory by building contextual understanding that links common uses or the crowd to specific organizational goals and desired outcomes. Second, the explanatory theoretical framework that was developed directly ties key characteristics of the crowd and organizational impacts to specific uses. As such, it establishes that different organizational needs necessitate the completion of different tasks that in turn require different skills and knowledge. Furthermore, different uses bring with them unique challenges and potential value. As such, the explanatory theory advances our theoretical understanding of the dynamics that present themselves when organizations attempt to integrate new resources into current business practices. Moreover, it builds a foundation from which researchers can expand theory related to this new phenomenon. With regard to its contributions to practice, the theory provides guidance to practitioners on which crowds, challenges, impacts, and values are associated with specific uses of crowdsourcing by established organizations. Such understanding may prove critical to organizations attempting to extract value from their crowdsourcing initiatives. Third, the Internal-Crowdsourcing Acceptance Model (ICAM) proposed here advances our theoretical understanding of the use of internal crowds for Product/Service Innovation and the critical role that proactive executive leaders play in reducing barriers to use and acceptance. ICAM theorizes internal-crowdsourcing for Product/Service Innovation as a disruptive business practice that has implications for organizational culture, internal processes, and structure. As such, it extends our current theoretical understanding of the role leadership plays in facilitating this new business practice. Additionally, it provides guidance to practitioners on how to address specific challenges and barriers to use and acceptance, thereby increasing opportunities to extract value from such initiatives.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8314], "author_name_tesi": "Erickson, Lisa B", "last_name_ssi": "Erickson", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth", "Irene Johnston Petrick", "Eileen M Trauth", "Dr Sandeep Purao", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth, Dissertation Advisor", "Irene Johnston Petrick, Dissertation Advisor", "Eileen M Trauth, Committee Chair", "Dr Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["crowdsourcing", "innovation", "new product development", "social media", "organizational change", "grounded theory", "case study"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "PREDICTORS OF UNPREDICTABILITY AND COVARIATES OF INVARIABILITY: MULTIMETHOD ASSESSMENT OF \nINTERPERSONAL RIGIDITY AND OSCILLATION\n", "id": "7139", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6239", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "That psychological maladjustment commonly derives from, and manifests itself in, problematic interpersonal relations forms a central tenet of interpersonal theory.

The present study sought to clarify the meaning of these personality indices on several IPC instruments vis-\u00e0-vis criterion variables reflecting variability of cross-situational social behavior and perceptions, true to Learian formulation.

The number of SGAs on the pharmaceutical market and their popularity has increased as clinical trials showed higher rates of responders, better functional capacity, an improved quality of life, and fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and prolactin elevation side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics (FGA). SGAs are recommended as the first-line treatment for schizophrenia and treatment resistant depression (3, 4). \nNevertheless, SGAs are associated with numerous adverse effects, most notably marked weight gain leading to obesity, metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and heart disease (5). Compared to the general population, SGA adverse effects shorten patient life-span by an estimated 25 years (6) primarily due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), increased medication non-adherence and clinical burden, costing billions of dollars in healthcare annually (7-9). The most severe weight gain phenotypes occur with the SGAs clozapine (CLZ) and olanzapine (OLZ). Thus, it is important to identify mechanisms that underlie SGA adverse effects and develop interventions to prevent SGA-associated weight gain. \nPharmacogenetics is the study of how genetic variation affects pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, thereby  influencing the efficacy and tolerability of a drug (10-12). The goal of pharmacogenetic studies is to identify genetic targets that predict the most efficacious drug and dose for a given individual, or reveal an individual\u2019s risk of treatment failure or adverse effects before starting a specific treatment, thus providing \u201cpersonalized medicine.\u201d SGA pharmacogenetic studies and individualized medicine are vital to improving outcomes using currently available SGAs and to designing more efficacious treatments in psychiatric medicine. Treatment effectiveness trials show that most SGAs work in a subset of patients and, in other patients, either lack efficacy or cause debilitating metabolic adverse effects that discourage patient adherence to treatment (13-16). It is not clear which pharmacogenetic targets, if any, predispose an individual to treatment efficacy or failure with SGAs. However, plasma concentrations of SGAs reflect brain concentrations of the drugs and have been correlated to SGA response , risk of weight gain and other adverse effects (17-22). Interindividual plasma concentrations are not necessarily predicted by the dose administered (17), suggesting that genetic variability in genes coding for drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) could affect SGA efficacy and tolerability (19). \nDMEs are classified as Phase I or Phase II depending on the type of reaction they catalyze. The uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are one group of Phase II enzymes that mediate greater than one-third of Phase II drug metabolism (23) and influence the plasma levels and clearance of a given compound (24). UGTs are important for the biotransformation and clearance of many SGAs as evidenced by plasma and urine metabolites in humans (25-27). CLZ undergoes extensive biotransformation; 97% of the administered dose is metabolized (17) and seven CLZ glucuronides have been identified in humans (26-28). One of these glucuronides is of the abundant, active metabolite N-desmethylclozapine (dmCLZ) (28) that is involved in causing agranulocytosis in 1-2% of patients taking CLZ (29); glucuronidation may be an important clearance mechanism for the reactive metabolite. CLZ plasma levels vary widely among patients administered the same dose (3-1507 ng/ml (17, 30, 31) and therapeutic response is related to plasma concentrations rather than drug dose (17). UGT activity against CLZ has been partially characterized: In vitro, UGT1A4 forms tertiary and quaternary CLZ-glucuronide metabolites, and the UGT1A4L48V polymorphism was twice as efficient as wild-type UGT1A4 (32).  This genetic difference, along with the extensive role that UGTs play in the metabolism and clearance of CLZ (17, 19, 26), suggests that UGT pharmacogenetic factors influence CLZ plasma levels. But, for CLZ and many SGAs, the UGTs that are enzymatically active have either not been characterized or only partially characterized. Additionally, the effects of UGT polymorphisms are largely unknown in vitro or in vivo. \nGlucuronide metabolic products account for 25% of the administered OLZ dose, making it the major OLZ metabolic pathway. The three most abundant OLZ-glucuronide metabolites in humans are: OLZ-10-N-glucuronide isomer 1, OLZ-10-N-glucuronide isomer 2, and OLZ-4\u2019-N-glucuronide. Previous in vitro studies using baculovirus-infected insect cells demonstrated that UGT1A4 is active against OLZ, with no activity observed for UGTs 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, 2B7. However, kinetic data for glucuronidation of OLZ could not be established for human liver microsomes (HLM) using OLZ concentrations spanning the apparent KM of UGT1A4, suggesting that other untested UGT enzymes contribute to OLZ glucuronidation in vivo (33). There is interindividual variability in OLZ clearance (20, 21, 34-37) and efficacy is positively correlated with plasma concentrations up to a threshold value (21). Weight gain and obesity are seen only in a subset of patients taking OLZ (38) and the evidence suggests that there is a dose-response relationship between OLZ serum concentrations and metabolic outcomes (39-42). \nStudies performed for this disseration characterized UGTs involved in the metabolism and clearance of the severe weight gain-inducing SGAs CLZ, dmCLZ, and OLZ. The first study investigated which UGT enzymes were active against CLZ, dmCLZ, and OLZ and characterized their kinetics. The UGT enzymes active against CLZ are UGTs 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, and 2B10; dmCLZ is UGT1A4; and OLZ are UGTs 1A4 and 2B10. In the second study, the kinetic profiles of these UGTs and their functional polymorphisms were established. Stably-transfected HEK293 cell lines that over-express each individual UGT were used in the second study and provided evidence of pharmacogenetic determinants of CLZ, dmCLZ, and OLZ metabolism in vitro. The third study demonstrated that genetic variants in these UGTs alter glucuronidation activity and kinetics of human livers in vitro. Finally, the fourth study investigated the effects of UGT genetic variants in vivo, and their relationship to SGA efficacy and adverse effects. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3443], "author_name_tesi": "Erickson-Ridout, Kathryn Kelly", "last_name_ssi": "Erickson-Ridout", "middle_name_ssi": "Kelly", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus", "Philip Lazarus", "Robert G Levenson", "Elliot Saul Vesell", "Robert Gabbay"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus, Dissertation Advisor", "Philip Lazarus, Committee Chair", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Elliot Saul Vesell, Committee Member", "Robert Gabbay, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["drug metabolism", "antipsychotics", "UDP-glucuronosyltransferases", "olanzapine", "pharmacogenetics", "clozapine"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Role of Influence in the Implementation of Public Policy: Pennsylvania HealthChoices - A Case Study", "id": "6898", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A core issue in policy implementation is why some policies appear to be enacted as designed while others change markedly during the implementation process. Policy implementation is evolutionary in nature and policies change. Determining how and why those changes occur can take many avenues. This case study explored how perceptions of influence held by specific groups and individuals affects the implementation of public health policy. Data were collected through structured interviews and historical document analysis. Set within the behavioral health system in Pennsylvania the study asked whether regional implementation of a new Medicaid policy \u2013 HealthChoices \u2013 was changed by the involvement of specific actors or groups. Three propositions explored relationships among and between five subsystems in the policy arena and the perceived influence of each group. The maturation of the state in policy oversight and expectation; personalities, value systems, and roles of counties in structuring the policy; and leadership changes at the state level during implementation are all referenced as reasons for policy change during implementation of HealthChoices. County government is perceived as having more influence on regional implementation. However, when not limiting responses to a particular region, the perceived influence of state and county government is almost evenly divided. The relationship between contracted managed care organization and county government is not believed to enhance the ability of counties to influence implementation. Findings suggest the perception that the ability of counties to influence policy implementation when local government manages day-to-day operations increases. Results also appear to support that Pennsylvania is attempting to address issues of micromanagement in public policy. The research suggests new research questions in understanding the role of influence in policy implementation.

Bovine OPN has a calcium binding site, a thrombin cleavage site and binds to various integrins through which it promotes cell adhesion and intracellular signaling.  OPN has also been positively correlated to fertility in the seminal plasma of Holstein bulls and has been identified in bovine oviductal fluid.  The purpose of this research was to investigate the presence of OPN on Holstein bull sperm, the role of OPN in bovine fertilization and the effects of OPN on sperm capacitation, intracellular calcium content, mitochondrial activity and viability to gain a better understanding of its role in fertility.  Semen was collected by artificial vagina and solubilized sperm membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.  A polyclonal rabbit antibody to purified bovine OPN (anti-OPN) detected OPN on sperm membranes, in testis homogenates and in cauda epididymal fluid.  Results indicated that ejaculated sperm had approximately 50% more OPN than epididymal sperm and the protein was localized to the post-acrosomal region of the sperm head as well as the midpiece.  Fertilization rates were reduced and incidence of polyspermy increased when sperm were incubated in anti-OPN prior to exposure to oocytes.  OPN was localized to the same postacrosomal region on sperm in which the acrosome reaction had been induced.  Integrin subunits known to associate with OPN were identified on bovine sperm and oocytes using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.  Other studies have shown that antibodies to these integrins decreased fertilization rates in the same manner as anti-OPN.  These results suggest that OPN interacts with integrins during bovine fertilization, and may be involved in a block to polyspermy.  OPN was also able to induce sperm capacitation and positively influenced sperm viability, but had no effect on sperm intracellular calcium content or mitochondrial activity.  Taken together these results suggest exciting new roles for OPN in male reproductive physiology.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1611], "author_name_tesi": "Erikson, David William", "last_name_ssi": "Erikson", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Joseph Killian", "Ronald Scott Kensinger", "Daniel R Hagen", "Guy Barbato", "Ramesh Ramachandran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Joseph Killian, Committee Chair", "Ronald Scott Kensinger, Committee Member", "Daniel R Hagen, Committee Member", "Guy Barbato, Committee Member", "Ramesh Ramachandran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["capacitation", "spermatozoa", "fertilization", "osteopontin"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF SINGLE PHASE AND CAVITATING\nFLOWS USING AN OPEN SOURCE CFD TOOL\n", "id": "9101", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5373", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents an open source implementation of a cavitation model and assesses the effectiveness\nof the solver with previous work on several validation cases.

Thus, the development of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) (also known as tertiary recovery) methods to improve recovery from developed fields has attracted attention.\nThermal recovery, a widely used EOR method in heavy oil reservoirs, involves the introduction of heat into the formation to reduce the viscosity of the oil in the reservoir.

Recent studies show that a clustered, multi-tier architecture is a cost-effective approach to design such servers. To complement this architecture, Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE)\nprovides the tools and the environment to standardize the implementation of Web-based applications. However, current versions of these data centers use TCP/IP over Ethernet for supporting the inter/intra cluster communication. \nNone of them have exploited the advantage of switching to the InfiniBand architecture to enhance the communication performance. In this context, this thesis aims to analyze the possible benefits of utilizing the InfiniBand communication mechanism. Our research consists of\nfive parts.\n\nFirst, we have implemented a three-tier data center prototype based on J2EE specification. This prototype implementation is used for conducting comparative experiments in order to analyze the possible benefits of IBA versus the traditional Ethernet. Our results with two popular benchmarks, RUBiS and SPECjAppServer2004, show that the IBA can \nprovide 21% better throughput and up to 15% reduction in average response time compared to Ethernet.\n\nSecond, we propose a novel load balancing mechanism for effectively distributing the load between application servers located in the mid-tier. \nOur load balancing technique is based on estimating the processing and communication requirements (weight) for each request by the amount \nof data required from the database to complete the request, and forwarding the requests to application servers accordingly. We have implemented this load balancing mechanism on our prototype data center. Using the same experimental setup, our load balancing technique can provide 11% improvement in throughput and up to 10% reduction in average response time compared to the default round-robin implementation running over SDP. This improvement is in addition to the benefits of IBA over Ethernet.\n\nThird, we investigated the feasibility of minimizing the response time of a Web server\nby exploiting the advantages of both user-level communication and coscheduling. We, thus, propose a coscheduled server model where the remote cache accesses can be coscheduled on different nodes to reduce the response time. We experiment this concept using two known coscheduling techniques, \ncalled Dynamic Coscheduling (DCS) and DCS with immediate blocking. Simulation based performance evaluation indicates that the average response time of a distributed server can be reduced up to 80%, on average 40%, using a coscheduling mechanism.\n\nFourth, we proposed a mechanism to exploit the local memory of programmable Network Interface Cards (NICs) to improve the performance of \ncluster-based Web servers. Our mechanism use the NIC memory for caching recently accessed data blocks to improve server performance. We have implemented a prototype of the proposed NIC caching mechanism for a distributed Web server, on an 8-node Linux cluster. Measurements with several server workloads show that NIC caching can\nenhance throughput by up to 27% and reduce the average intra-cluster latency by around 20%, by minimizing the DMA and PCI bus overhead. \n\nFinally, we have conducted a characterization study\nof the network behavior within a clustered, multi-tiered data center. Using a real implementation of a clustered three-tier data center, we analyzed the arrival rate and inter-arrival time distribution of the requests to\nindividual server nodes, the network traffic between tiers, and the average size of messages exchanged between tiers. The main results of this study are; (1) in most cases, the request inter-arrival rates follow log-normal distribution, and self-similarity exists when the data center is heavily loaded, (2) message sizes can be modeled by the log-normal distribution, and (3) service times fit reasonably well with the Pareto distribution and show heavy tailed behavior at heavy loads.\n\nThis research helps to understand the possible benefits of IBA in cluster-based, multi-tier data centers. Our results show that IBA can improve the performance in data centers and the proposed load balancing, coscheduling and NIC caching\nmechanisms yield further performance improvements. In addition, the results of our\nworkload characterization study can be helpful in\nunderstanding the details of the inner workings of data centers and thus, could be used in\ndesigning and fine-tuning network interfaces and servers in the future.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1629], "author_name_tesi": "Ersoz, Deniz ", "last_name_ssi": "Ersoz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deniz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Guohong Cao", "Wang Chien Lee", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["data centers", "infiniband", "cluster networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "LEARNING IN EXTREME CONDITIONS: ONLINE AND ACTIVE LEARNING WITH MASSIVE, IMBALANCED AND NOISY DATA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9484", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6060", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses improving the performance of machine learning algorithms with a particular focus on classification tasks with large, imbalanced and noisy datasets. The field of machine learning addresses the question of how best to use experimental or historical data to discover general patterns and regularities and improve the process of decision making. However, applying machine learning algorithms to very large scale problems still poses challenges. Additionally, class imbalance and noise in the data degrade the prediction accuracy of standard machine learning algorithms. The main focus of this thesis is designing machine learning algorithms and approaches that are faster, data efficient and less demanding in computational resources to achieve scalable algorithms for large scale problems. This thesis addresses these problems in active and online learning frameworks. The particular focus of the thesis is on Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with classification problems, but the proposed approaches on active and online learning are also well extensible to other widely used machine learning algorithms.<br><br>\n\nThis thesis first proposes a fast online Support Vector Machine algorithm (LASVM) that has an outstanding speed improvement over the classical (batch) SVM and other online SVM algorithms, while preserving the classification accuracy rates of the state-of-the-art SVM solvers. The ability to handle streaming data, speed improvement in both training and recognition and the demand for less memory with the online learning setting enable SVM to be applicable to very large datasets. The effectiveness of LASVM and active learning in real world problems is assessed by targeting the name disambiguation problem in CiteSeer's repository of scientific publications. The thesis then presents an efficient active learning framework to target the expensive labeling problem for producing training data. The proposed method yields an efficient querying system and removes the barriers of applying active learning to very large scale datasets due to the high computational costs. We then point out that even when the labels are readily available, active learning can still be used to reach out to the most informative instances in the training data. By applying active sample selection and early stopping in the online SVM, we show that the algorithm can reach and even exceed the prediction accuracies of baseline setting of LASVM with random sampling. Our experimental results also reveal that active learning can be a highly effective method for dealing with the class imbalance problem. We further propose a hybrid method of oversampling and active learning to form an adaptive technique (named VIRTUAL) to efficiently resample the minority class instances in imbalanced data classification. Finally, we propose a non-convex online SVM algorithm (LASVM-NC) based on the Ramp loss, which has strong ability of suppressing the influences of outliers in noisy datasets. Then, again in the online learning setting, we propose an outlier filtering mechanism that approximates non-convex behavior in convex optimization (LASVM-I). These two algorithms are built on an online SVM solver (LASVM-G) which leverages the duality gap to obtain more trustworthy intermediate models. Our experimental results show that the proposed approaches yield a more scalable online SVM algorithm with sparser models and less computational running time both in the training and recognition phases without sacrificing generalization performance. In the end, we also point out the relation between the non-convex behavior in SVMs and active learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6053], "author_name_tesi": "Ertekin, Seyda ", "last_name_ssi": "Ertekin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seyda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "C Lee Giles", "Leon Bottou", "Raj Acharya", "Jia Li", "Tracy Mullen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Dissertation Advisor", "C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "Leon Bottou, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member", "Jia Li, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Machine Learning", "Online Learning", "Active Learning", "Support Vector Machines", "Classification", "Data Mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Excitation of Multiple Surface-Plasmon-Polariton Waves At Metal/Chiral-Sculptured-Thin-Film Interfaces\n\n\n\n", "id": "11938", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5817", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this research was to excite multiple surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves guided by the interface of a metal and a chiral sculptured thin film (STF). For this purpose, three different experimental set-ups were used. The data were collected for several different samples. Aluminum, magnesium fluoride, zinc selenide and sodium fluoride are the materials that were used to deposit thin films.\n Both metal and chiral STFs were deposited by a thermal evaporation technique. In all cases, a 30-nm-thick aluminum film was deposited first on a pre-cleaned glass slide.  Next, to deposit a chiral STF, the substrate holder in the vacuum chamber of the thermal evaporation system was tilted and rotated. The vapor flux angle, i.e., the angle between incoming vapor flux and the substrate plane, is called Xv. Chiral STFs deposited at Xv = 10 and Xv = 15 were used to understand the effects of different directions of the incoming vapor flux.  Also, the thicknesses of chiral STFs were varied between 900 nm and 1500 nm. The chiral STFs were deposited in 3, 4, and 5 periods, each period being 300 nm in thickness. Besides chiral STFs, columnar thin films were deposited for comparison.\nA He-Ne laser was used as a light source to illuminate the sample which was affixed to a BK7 glass prism, and the reflectance was detected by a photomultiplier detector for both p- and s- polarizations of the incident light. Graphs of the reflectance versus the angle of incidence were plotted.\n\n If the angular location of a reflectance minimum is independent of the thickness of the chiral STF, then it is evidence of an SPP wave. Results of the experiments for Glass-slide/Aluminum/NaF-chiral-STF structure showed several reflectance minimums independent of the thickness of the chiral STF; hence, multiple SPP waves were launched.

STFs are generally fabricated via\nphysical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques [1]. A chiral STF is an assembly of\nidentical and parallel nanohelixes. In order to deposit a chiral STF, the substrate\nholder in the vacuum chamber of a thermal evaporation system should be tilted at\na fixed angle and rotated at a constant rate during deposition. Chiral STFs exhibit\nthe circular Bragg phenomenon (CBP) when interacting with circularly polarized\nincident light. Also, they can be used to excite multiple surface-plasmon-polariton\n(SPP) waves when deposited on top of a metallic grating.\nThe CBP is described as circular-polarization-selective reflection. It occurs\nwhen circularly polarized light is incident on a film of a structurally chiral material\nexemplified by cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) and chiral STFs. When the handedness\nof the circularly polarized incident light matches the structural handedness\nof the structurally chiral material with a sufficient thickness, the incident light is\nhighly reflected in a specific wavelength regime. If the handedness of the circularly\npolarized light and structural handedness of the film are mismatched, the reflection\nis very little [2]. The CBP has been exploited for various optical applications such\nas circular-polarization filters and reflectors.\nSPP waves propagate along the interface of a metal and a dielectric material.\nSimilar to any other surface wave, SPP waves are sensitive to irregularities near\nthe interface. Only one SPP wave can be excited when the dielectric material\nis homogeneous. When the dielectric material is replaced by a non-homogeneous\none, the direction of non-homogeneity being normal to the interface, more than one\nSPP wave can be excited. The multiplicity of SPP waves at a specific frequency\nwhen the non-metallic partnering material is periodically non-homogeneous offers\nadvantages for optical sensing of analytes.\nFor this dissertation, the broadband responses of chiral STFs deposited on\nplanar and non-planar substrates were investigated. The objective was to experimentally\ninvestigate and qualitatively, if not quantitatively, prove theoretical preiii\ndictions about the optical responses of chiral STFs. The motivation was to design\nand engineer chiral STFs for optical applications and devices.\nThe dissertation has four main chapters based on:\n(i) The CBP exhibited by chiral STFs for oblique angles of incidence,\n(ii) The CBP exhibited by mirror-backed chiral STFs for oblique angles of incidence,\n(iii) Dual-band circular polarization filters, and\n(iv) Excitation of multiple SPP waves guided by the interface of a chiral STF and\na one-dimensional (1D) metallic grating.\nThe first main chapter is focused on the investigation of the CBP for oblique\nangles of incidence to experimentally prove theoretical predictions. Chiral STFs\nof zinc selenide were deposited on BK7 glass substrates by thermal evaporation.\nSpecular and non-specular reflectance and transmittance data were collected using\na custom-made experimental set-up. The results clearly indicated the circular\nBragg regime for all angles of incidence investigated. A blue-shift in the wavelength\nregime of the CBP with increasing angle of incidence was observed. The results\nare in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions, qualitatively.\nThe second one is a follow-up study to understand the exhibition of the CBP\nwhen the transmittance is blocked. A chiral STF was backed by a highly reflective\nmirror and the reflectance spectrums were measured. The results indicated that\nwhen the transmittance is blocked, all remittances show evidence of the CBP\ninstead of just one remittance.\nThe third one is focused on a novel strategy for fabricating dual-band circular\npolarization filters. For this study, chiral STFs of zinc selenide were deposited\non both sides of a substrate by the serial bideposition (SBD) technique [3]. The\ntransmittance data were collected for normally incident light. Two different circular\nBragg regimes were observed centered at different wavelengths.\nThe last main chapter is focused on exciting multiple SPP waves guided by the\ninterface of a chiral STF and a metallic grating. The chiral STFs were deposited\nby the thermal evaporation technique on 1D metallic gratings. The specular and\nnon-specular transmittance and reflectance measurements were completed using\na custom-made variable-angle spectroscopic system. At least three different SPP\nwaves were excited experimentally. The results can be used to increase the sensing\ncapabilities of SPP wave based sensors by increasing the number of analytes that\ncan be detected at a time. The practicality of such sensors can be increased due\nto the fact that there is no need for a prism to excite SPP waves when employing\nthe grating-coupled configuration.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16944], "author_name_tesi": "Erten, Sema ", "last_name_ssi": "Erten", "first_name_ssi": "Sema", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Dr. Dinesh Agrawal ", " Dr. Jian Xu ", "Dr. Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Dr. Thomas Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Dinesh Agrawal , Committee Chair", " Dr. Jian Xu , Committee Member", "Dr. Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member", "Dr. Thomas Mallouk, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chiral sculptured thin films"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Same Schools, Different Classes: Socio-Economic StatusHomophily in Adolescent Friendship Networks ", "id": "23329", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research has found that the preference for associating with those most similar to us in terms of race and gender has been particularly important for shaping the social networks and friendships for American youth.  Homophily is defined as the tendency for people to associate with those most similar to themselves within networks (McPherson et al., 2001).  However, research on homophily within social networks has not traditionally included socio-economic status in analyses.  In this paper, socio-economic status is defined as parental education level, familial income, and type of parental occupation.   This paper explores how socio-economic status, in three distinct forms, shapes the composition of adolescent social networks within one school in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health using three different methods.  These methods include centrality analyses and Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure.  Similarly, the extent of social class homophily among friendship dyads is assessed in comparison to gender, race, and grade homophily using Exponential Random Graph Models.  Income, occupational, and educational homophily have separate and distinctive effects, as shown by analyses, which is why including more forms of homophily beyond typical control variables (grade, gender, age, and race) may be helpful for understanding friendship ties between students.

Although a lot of information has been published related to the production of the premium coke, via mesophase formation, some contradictory results have been reported because the conclusions are reached based on chemical composition of the feedstock alone or reactor design alone.\nA raw decant oil, EI-107, was hydrotreated to different levels giving origin to six derivatives.  Based on greater differences in chemical composition between the hydrotreated decant oils and the raw decant oil, and the sample quantity, three out of six derivatives were selected to continue with the carbonization process.  It was found that the quality of the coke obtained through the pyrolysis of the four decant oils using the reactor operated at atmospheric pressure and 465\u201eaC (LSCopen) is related to the chemical composition of the decant oil.  The coke that displays the lowest coke quality is EI-135, which is explained by the presence of five-membered rings and biphenyls in the decant oil that are detrimental to the mesophase formation due to the loss of planarity and free rotation.  Even though this decant oil has alkylbenzenes which improve the mesophase formation, it appears that the amount of these compounds is not enough to compensate the negative effect that five-membered rings and biphenyls exert on the mesophase.  The next best coke in quality is EI-107.  While its feedstock (EI-107) has the lowest amount of alkylbenzenes and naphthenic compounds, the decant oil EI-107 displays little or no presence of five-membered rings and biphenyls making its quality higher than coke EI-135.  The cokes EI-134 and EI-138 display, respectively, the highest coke quality among the four cokes tested.  Their feedstocks have the highest amount of alkylbenzenes and naphthenic compounds but an intermediate content of biphenyls.  Five-membered ring compounds were not detected in decant oils EI-134 and EI-138.\nThe viscosity of the system has been reported to be crucial for the coke quality, via mesophase growth.  This study was performed by using a laboratory-scale coker operated under autogenous pressure and 465\u201eaC (LSCclose), which keeps the gases in the reactor so that the viscosity of the system is reduced.   The hierarchy in coke quality was found to be completely different to when the LSCopen was used.  The coke EI-107, which is derived from the highest polycondensed feedstock, displayed the highest quality.  The cokes EI-134, EI-135 and EI-138, which are the cokes derived from the hydrotreated decant oils, displayed the lowest.  In summary, there is an optimum viscosity to obtain a high coke quality.  When viscosity is too low, mesophase spheres do not coalesce. \nLast but not least, this work also studied blends of coal and the four selected decant oils as a feedstock to produce coke; the blend was pyrolyzed using the reactors LSCopen, LSCclose and the pilot-scale coker (PSC).  Miscibility and chemical interactions (hydrogen transferability) between coal and decant oil were calculated in order to study their influence on the co-coke quality.  When the reactors operated under atmospheric and near-atmospheric pressure (LSCopen and PSC), no correlation was found between miscibility or chemical interactions with co-coke quality.  However, chemical interaction appears to correlate when LSCclose is used.  This is attributed to the higher contact time between coal and decant oil, which occurs at the operational conditions of the reactor LSCclose.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4243], "author_name_tesi": "Escallon, Maria Mercedes", "last_name_ssi": "Escallon", "middle_name_ssi": "Mercedes", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Alan W Scaroni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Alan W Scaroni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["solubility parameters", "needle coke", "petroleum", "coal", "co-coking", "interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Langmuir Probe Instrument for Research in the Terrestrial Ionosphere\n", "id": "9629", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "41", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Langmuir probes have been used for plasma diagnostics on spacecraft ever since the first sounding rockets in the 1950s.

Membrane proteins (MP) are a difficult class of proteins to study; however, their medical and biotechnical importance makes them compelling to address the associated challenges. Difficulties of expressing membrane proteins have been reported in number of other protein expression systems such as Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cell culture.  The anaerobic photoheterotroph, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, has the desirable characteristic of large quantities of intracellular membranes (typically absent in prokaryotes) as a result of the need to assemble the photosynthetic apparatus which facilitates ATP formation in light, without oxygen formation.  The genetic engineering strategy focused on the use of the natural photosynthetic expression machinery to drive expression of the MP of interest in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Anaerobic photoheterotrophic growth can be implemented in anaerobic photobioreactors where it has been previously proven to achieve biomass yields of more than 9.2 grams cells dry weight per liter (gDW/L) have been achieved.\nThe expression of homologous and heterologous proteins was studied using fluorescent fusion tags and optimized with respect to temperature. The homologous water-transport membrane protein Aquaporin Z (rAqpZ) and heterologous human kidney Aquaporin 9 (human AQP9) and human Ocluddin (human OCLN) were successfully expressed in the Rhodobacter. Expression levels were quantified by monitoring sample fluorescence and Western Blot densitometry (WBD) of Monomeric Banana YFP (mBanana). Correlations between off-line sampled culture fluorescence and WBD were developed through the use of pure protein standards to demonstrate the feasibility of using fluorescence measurements as the screening method for quantifying membrane protein levels in vivo.\n To demonstrate the utility of such correlation for optimizing protein expression, temperature effects were studied as a simple optimization parameter.  Cold, ambient and optimal growth temperatures (16\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C, respectively) for Rhodobacter were studied under anaerobic photoheterotrophic conditions, required to induce protein expression from the puc promoter used to drive MP expression.  The expression of both the heterologous and homologous membrane proteins studied was found to be optimum at ambient temperature (25\u00b0C). Expression of the homologous and heterologous proteins using mBanana as a reporter were estimated around 3.5 mg-Protein/L-culture and 0.5 mg-Protein/L-culture after 24 hours of culture time.\nAlthough the mBanana fluorescent fusion served as an effective method for correlating membrane protein concentration, these measurements could only be taken offline.  The requirement for offline measurement results because variants of GFP (green fluorescent protein) such as mBanana are obligate aerobic fluorescent proteins and require oxygen exposure to fluoresce properly.  This presents a significant experimental constraint due to the required anaerobic growth conditions imposed for the expression of membrane proteins in Rhodobacter. Maturation of the fluorescent proteins involves folding in the presence of oxygen, during which time the fluorescence level per protein increases. Measurements of mBanana-MP fusion maturation within Rhodobacter showed that mBanana required more than 40 hours to mature (20 times its monomeric literature value). This long maturation time further precludes the use of this protein for rapid and online monitoring.\nRiboflavin-binding fluorescent proteins (RBFP) represent an alternative to the problem of obligate aerobic fluorescent proteins. RBFPs have the ability to absorb and emit light in the absence or presence of oxygen. In this research, pGlow-Pp1 \u201cEvoglow\u201d RBFP (commercially available from EvoCatal) was used as an alternative fusion tag to track the expression of the membrane proteins. The facultative anaerobic RBFP was shown to be an effective measure of concentration of membrane proteins in vivo and \u201conline\u201d under the anaerobic process conditions set for expression. Future work will focus on the use of these tags and correlations, to optimize and understand the expression of membrane proteins online using other Rhodobacter promoter genes and culture conditions.\nStatistically significant differences were found between the predicted concentrations using different fluorescent proteins. Underestimation was apparent when using the aerobic mBanana compared to Evoglow. Fluorescent protein stability and sample time was attributed to these differences. Further studies on the practicality and accuracy of Evoglow as a reporter protein for membrane protein expression need to be done as a continuation of this project. Future work should focus on the use of these tags and correlations, to optimize and understand the expression of membrane proteins online using other Rhodobacter gene promoters and culture conditions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8968], "author_name_tesi": "Escotet Espinoza, Manuel Sebastian", "last_name_ssi": "Escotet Espinoza", "middle_name_ssi": "Sebastian", "first_name_ssi": "Manuel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Manish Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Thesis Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Membrane proteins", "heterologous expression", "Rhodobacter", "photoheterotrophic"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Modulation of prostate cancer cell proliferation and gene expression by dietary fatty acids and effects of adipocyte conditioned media", "id": "14549", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7481", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fish oil contains the marine omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).  Consuming diets rich in these fatty acids has been associated with decreased incidence of prostate cancer, however much less is known about the non-marine n-3 PUFA alpha linolenic acid (ALA).  To study which n-3 PUFA are more effective in prostate cancer prevention, and whether mechanisms of action are conserved between them, we tested DHA, EPA and ALA on the human prostate cancer cell line PC3.  PC3 cells were treated with DHA, EPA, or ALA and changes in cell proliferation and gene expression examined. Different trends of inhibition of PC3 proliferation were observed for the three n-3 PUFA, with DHA exhibiting the most pronounced effects on PC3 cell proliferation and altered gene expression; ALA was the least efficacious of the three n-3 PUFA. All n-3 PUFA decreased fatty acid synthase (FASN) mRNA, and its regulator sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA to 50% of control levels.  DHA, EPA and ALA decreased expression of macrophage chemotactic factor 1 (MCP1), an autocrine prostate cancer growth factor. Looking at genes involving inflammation, cell cycle and apoptosis, DHA regulated the greatest number of genes in all categories, followed by EPA and then ALA.  In addition DHA and EPA increased gene expression of the pro-apoptotic protein activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) mRNA by 11-fold and 3-fold, respectively while ALA had no effect.  Moreover, DHA and EPA, but not ALA, significantly induced apoptosis.  We conclude while some mechanisms of cancer cell inhibition are conserved among n-3 PUFA, the extent, magnitude, and duration of transcriptional changes vary for each individual fatty acid. \nObesity in men, particularly an abundance of abdominal fat deposits, has been correlated with increased incidence and poor prognosis of prostate cancer.  Fat may also affect the activity of prostate cancer cells that metastasize to bone, as the bones of older individuals are composed predominantly of fatty tissue.  N-3 PUFA are effective agents in cancer prevention and therapy, although their precise mechanisms of action and the differences between them have not been fully characterized.  In addition to omega-3 PUFA, other fatty acids, including certain omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs, and both 10-trans,12-cis (10e12z) and 9-cis,11-trans (9z11e) isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), also inhibit proliferation of PC3 prostate cancer cells.  To mimic fat cells in the body, and determine whether the presence of these fat cells would affect the inhibitory actions of fatty acids, we used a two-step model of media preconditioning and treatment.  Culture media containing inhibitory concentrations of fatty acids was first conditioned on 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and then administered to PC3 cells.  Here, we show that 3T3-L1 adipocytes modulate the effects of fatty acid treatment, generally rendering the fatty acids less effective in proliferative inhibition of PC3 prostate cancer cells.  The mechanism of inhibition of the PC3 cells\u2019 response to fatty acids in the presence of fat cells may be significant to understanding the correlation between obesity and resistance to prostate cancer therapy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7425], "author_name_tesi": "Eser, Pinar Ozden", "last_name_ssi": "Eser", "middle_name_ssi": "Ozden", "first_name_ssi": "Pinar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Prostate cancer", "obesity", "omega fatty acids", "adipocytes"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "KNOWLEDGE CO-PRODUCTION AND AGRICULTURAL FIELD DAYS: \nA COMPARISON OF THREE MODELS \n", "id": "11560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3033", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As elsewhere in the United States, agriculture in Pennsylvania includes diversity in farm operators and businesses, in terms of farmer demographics, levels of experience, and current and preferred management practices.  Several different farming-related organizations now exist to meet the unique learning needs across this heterogeneous farmer base, and may, in this role, help shape farm-level decision-making.  This study examines the Pennsylvania State University College of Agricultural Sciences and Cooperative Extension (PSU), the Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture (PASA), and the Pennsylvania Women\u2019s Agricultural Network (WAgN) to understand how three different Pennsylvania farming-related organizations, targeting different farmer populations, produce and disseminate agricultural knowledge.  I apply contributions in the sociology of scientific knowledge from Ludwik Fleck and literature on farmer participation to clarify if and how knowledge within each organization is co-produced by farmers and experts.  Qualitative field research methods centered on attending three agricultural field days (farmer education events held on farms or research stations to educate attendees on a specific topic) offered by each of the organizations in the study. I conducted interviews with organizers, presenters, and farmer participants (n=57) at these nine field days, and also engaged in participant observation of ongoing field day activities and interactions.  The research found that agricultural knowledge was co-produced at all field days, regardless of which organization sponsored the event; however, the level of farmer participation was more pronounced at the PASA and WAgN field days than at the PSU field days.  Because farmers attending the PSU field days noted that expert-driven knowledge effectively met their learning needs, I conclude that more farmer participation should not be assumed to be the best or desired outcome from the farmer perspective.  I further suggest that field days can present unrecognized opportunities for collaboration among the three farming-related organizations in this study, because their field day content sometimes overlapped, particularly in the area of sustainable agricultural production methods.  This research contributes to scholarship on the sociology of scientific knowledge in agriculture by empirically analyzing dynamics of knowledge co-production when a mix of experts and non-experts, including farmers, scientists, industry representatives, and other field day participants, are involved.

Clarifying patterns of convergence and divergence in the AAM organizational field is a necessary step to understanding the mobilization potential of these movements. This research investigated how patterns of issue selection among a sample of U.S. national agrifood organizations (N=690) manifested convergence and diversity in an agrifood field that included both AAM organizations and their potential opponents.  The research applied cluster analysis techniques to categorize the organizational field by the combination of issues an organization selected\u2014or issue orientation\u2014to demonstrate the diverse organizational perspectives on agrifood issues.

Negative binomial regression analyses modeled issue orientation as a predictor of a social movement outcome\u2014gaining acceptance\u2014that was operationalized as providing testimony on agrifood topics at Congressional hearings. Results showed that national agrifood organizations broadly fit into clusters of either Status Quo, AAM, or diet-related health/food security issue orientations.

Although in bivariate tests, Status Quo agrifood organizations were more likely than all other clusters to provide Congressional testimony in both cluster solutions, when controlling for resources and strategies, environmentally-focused AAM organizations were similar to Status Quo organizations in being significantly more likely than other sub-clusters to gain acceptance through Congressional hearings.

After three disasters in 2006, the \u201cMINER Act of 2006\u201d was passed which strengthened the \u201cFederal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977\u201d by mandating new laws and safety regulations. The MINER Act increased the chance of getting citations and consequently a significant increase in the penalty amounts in 2006 compared to the previous years. These issues could impact the production of the mines until.\nIn this thesis, MSHA databases were used to study the mine-size transitions and the productivity. In the mine-size transition study, the MSHA address/employment database was used to observe the mine-size transitions of 454 underground coal mines in the 5-year period of 2003-2007. This study showed that Very Large and Large mines were the most faithful to their size category.  In the second study, MSHA address/employment, accident/injury, and inspection databases were used to study the impact of safety measures and structural factors on the productivity of underground coal mines in the period of 2003-2007. For this study, mines were categorized in three categories of Very Large/Large, Medium, and Small/Very Small. Using Forward and Backward Stepwise regression methods a robust multi-linear regression model was generated for each mine-size category to find the significant factors impacting the productivity of the mines in each category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5812, 5813], "author_name_tesi": "Eslambolchi, Safa ", "last_name_ssi": "Eslambolchi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Safa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr R Larry Grayson", "R Larry Grayson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr R Larry Grayson, Thesis Advisor", "R Larry Grayson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["underground coal mines", "regression analysis", "safety", "productivity", "mine size transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGES IN THE OPERATIONAL STRUCTURES AND SAFETY MEASURES OF U.S. UNDERGROUND COAL MINES ACROSS DIFFERENT MINE-SIZE CATEGORIES, 2000-2014", "id": "13162sue113", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13162", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Significant driving pressures, such as electricity market conditions, and safety and environmental laws, regulations, and policies can impact the operational structure and viability of the underground coal mining industry. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) actions in pursuit of clean air resulted in the retirement of several coal-fired power plants. Recent fatal underground coal mine disasters have resulted in stricter safety regulations, elevated penalties, and mine shutdowns. The objective of this study is to understand the changes in the operational structure and safety measures of U.S. underground coal mines across different mine-size categories during the period 2000-2014. The changes in the operational structures of the mines were studied by examining the year-to-year changes in the mine-size and operational status categories during the period 2000-2014. The differences in three normalized safety measures, Non-fatal Days Lost Incident Rates (NFDLIRs), No-days Lost Incident Rates (NDLIRs), and Severity Measures (SMs), were examined across different mines-size categories over the periods 2005-2009 and 2010-2014. For this study, large amount of empirical data were collected from the Mine Safety and Health Administration\u2019s (MSHA) Address/Employment and Accident/Injury files, and Assessed Violations datasets as well as Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) reports for the period 2000-2014.\n\nThe size of a mine can change from one year to another because of various reasons, such as, temporary or permanent mine closure, planned increases or decreases in production, or mine depletion. The sizes of the mines were determined in each year based on the average number of employees working in the mines as well as the production of the mines. The number of mines in each mine-size category in each year were determined. Year-to-year mine-size transition probabilities were calculated and fourteen 8x8 right-stochastic mine-size transition probability matrices were created. Size-stability, size-decrease, and size-increase probabilities for each mine-size category for each year-to-year transition time period were calculated too. The total number of underground mines decreased by almost 43% from 2000 to 2014. The number of the Very Large mines increased by 20% from 2009 to 2014. The number of the Large mines and the Medium mines decreased by 22% and 40%, respectively, from 2012 to 2014. The number of the Small and Very Small mines almost steadily decreased by 59.5% and 55.6%, respectively, from 2008 to 2014. On average, the Very Large and Large mines with size-stability probabilities of 0.937 and 0.767, respectively, were found to be the most resilient mines followed by the Medium, Small, and Very Small mines with the size-stability probabilities of 0.611, 0.565, and 0.544, respectively. Mine-size transitions of two or more sizes up or down transitions, which were rare and usually were associated with probabilities of less than 5% were noted as \u201cunusual\u201d mine-size transitions. The larger mines (Very Large and Large mines) were found to be more resilient in adapting to the driving pressures affecting the industry.\n\nThe status of a mine can change from one year to another because of various reasons such\nas, temporary or permanent mine shut downs, which can be a voluntary or involuntary decision of the mine operator. It is important to understand the dynamics of mine status changes to avoid involuntarily mine shut downs when possible. The operational status of the mines in each year were determined along with the changed in the operational statuses of the mines from one year to another. Year-to-year transition probabilities of the mines were calculated showing the probability of the mines transitioning within seven operation statuses. The results show that the total number of Active mines dramatically decreased by 52.4% from 544 in 2000 to 259 in 2014. The majority of the decrease occurred after 2010 from 508 Active mines to 259 in 2014. The majority of the decreases occurred in the number of Medium, Small, and Very Small mines. On average, an Active mine would remain Active in the next year with a probability of 77.6% while it would be Closed by MSHA, Permanently Abandoned, or Temporality Closed with probabilities of 11.4%, 6.8%, and 2.6%, respectively. Also, Temporarily Closed mines would remain closed the next year with the probability of 71.3% and would be Permanently Abandoned with a probability of 20.7%.\n\nThe Normalized safety performance measures (NDLIR, NFDLIR, and SM) of the Active underground coal mines were calculated and studied across five mine-size categories, Very Large, Large, Medium, Small, and Very Small, over the periods 2005-2009 and 2010-2014. For each safety performance measure, the Mann-Whitney U tests were done across the five different mine- size categories to test the differences in the observations from the first period to the next. The NDLIRs of Large and Medium mines were found to be lower in the second period compared to the first period. Both NFDLIRs and SMs of the Very Large, Large, Medium, and Small mines were found to be lower in the second period compared to the first period. Statistically no differences were found in the NDLFIRs and SMs of Very Small mines from the first period to the second period. Moreover, the NFDLIR means for each mine-size category were much larger than their corresponding NDLIR means. A drastic decrease of more than 50% in the severity measure mean of Small mines in the second period was observed which can be attributed to the closure of several small mines during that period. Overall, we can conclude that the safety measures of the Very Large, Large, Medium, and Small mines were significantly lower in the period 2010-2014 compared to 2005-2009.\n\nSize matters. The results of this research showed that conducting analyses across different mine-size categories could yield to different results compared to when analyzing all the mines in one pool. The sizes of the mines should be taken into account when developing new laws, regulations, or policies concerning underground coal mines. This research may help the MSHA and other state agencies in developing more effective regulations and policies, which take into account the size of the underground coal mining operations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13687], "author_name_tesi": "Eslambolchi, Safa ", "last_name_ssi": "Eslambolchi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Safa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy M.

There are many cellular processes that are responsible for altering protein expression levels, including transcription initiation and termination, translation initiation and elongation, and co-translational protein folding. Successful manipulation of each of these processes requires the understanding of their mechanism, and how macromolecular machineries such as RNA polymerases and ribosomes interact with DNAs and mRNAs. In particular, the ribosome\u2019s interactions with mRNA govern its translation rate and the effects of post-transcriptional regulation. It has been shown that translation initiation is a rate limiting step in protein production, in which ribosome must efficiently make the first contact with mRNA. Although translation initiation is one of the well-studied processes inside cells, there are still many unanswered questions that puzzled researchers for several decades. For example, what is the role of 5\u2019 untranslated regions on protein synthesis rate? How the N-terminal coding section controls ribosome binding to mRNA? How the regulatory components such as small RNAs and ligand-responsive riboswitches alter the ribosome binding rate? Can RNA folding kinetics compete with ribosome binding rate to alter the binding equilibrium between mRNA and ribosome? \nIn this dissertation, we aim to answer these questions by taking a \u201clearn-by-design\u201d approach, in which we first propose a plausible mechanism, and then we conduct specific experiments to test our hypothesis while eliminating other confounding interactions, followed by developing mechanistic models that can explain the experimental observations. Our ultimate goal is to develop simplified yet accurate models that can predict the rate of translation initiation and riboswitch regulation directly from DNA sequence, using kinetics and thermodynamics first principles. These biophysics-based models can be further improved by identifying new interactions, characterizing their effects, and incorporating them into the existing models. \nOverall, through our biophysical modeling approach, we developed an accurate and comprehensive model of bacterial translation initiation that predicts the rate of translation under both equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. In addition, we also developed the first sequence-structure-function relationship for translation-regulating riboswitches that predicts the function of riboswitches from the energetic interactions between mRNA, ligand, and ribosome. Importantly, the incorporation of this biophysics-based model into a web-interface called the Riboswitch Calculator, allows the scientific community to design new generation of high-performance biosensors for diverse applications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11464], "author_name_tesi": "Espah Borujeni, Amin ", "last_name_ssi": "Espah Borujeni", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Howard M Salis", "Howard M Salis", "Manish Kumar", "Kyle Jeffrey Magnuson Bishop", "Philip C.

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of using ultrafiltration for separating plasmid topological isoforms; however these data were obtained over short times with very dilute solutions. The overall objective of this dissertation was to address these issues thereby providing a more extensive evaluation of the potential of ultrafiltration in the large-scale production of plasmid DNA.\nData obtained at higher plasmid concentrations showed a significant reduction in plasmid transmission during ultrafiltration even under conditions where the filtrate flux remained relatively constant. These results were explained using a simple model in which the membrane pores become partially blocked by plasmids that are trapped at the pore entrance. These \u201cblocked\u201d pores remain permeable to fluid due to the very open structure of the plasmid. The extent of plasmid fouling increased with increasing plasmid size, consistent with the greater probability of having a \u201cknot\u201d in the long DNA molecule.  Model calculations were in excellent agreement with the experimental data over a wide range of conditions in both constant pressure and constant flux ultrafiltration.\nThe effects of plasmid fouling could be dramatically reduced by backpulsing. Experiments were performed over a range of pulse duration, frequency, and amplitude to identify the optimal set of operating parameters. High performance could be achieved using a pulse with zero back-pressure, i.e. by simply clamping the permeate exit line while maintaining crossflow, suggesting that the trapped plasmids were removed from the pore primarily by the crossflow.  A diafiltration process with pulsing provided more than 98% recovery of the plasmid in the permeate compared to only a 35% yield without pulsing. \nThe performance of the ultrafiltration process could be further improved by altering the membrane pore structure / morphology.  Data obtained with asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes in the reverse orientation showed much greater plasmid transmission at the same filtrate flux. This increase in transmission was due to the pre-extension of the plasmid which facilitates elongation and transmission of the plasmid through the small pores in the membrane skin. Membrane fouling was significantly reduced in this reverse filtration, possibly due to the \u201cun-knotting\u201d of the plasmid in the large pores within the membrane support. \nA laboratory-scale centrifugal ultrafiltration process was developed as a high-throughput method for quickly screening ultrafiltration for plasmid purification. A simple model was developed to evaluate the filtrate flux as a function of centrifugal conditions. Plasmid transmission in the centrifugal device was similar to that seen in pressure-driven ultrafiltration under comparable conditions. \nThe results obtained in this thesis provide important insights into plasmid ultrafiltration, while furthering the development of ultrafiltration processes for the purification of plasmid DNA isoforms.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10314], "author_name_tesi": "Espah Borujeni, Ehsan Allah", "last_name_ssi": "Espah Borujeni", "middle_name_ssi": "Allah", "first_name_ssi": "Ehsan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Themis Matsoukas", "Michael John Janik", "William O Hancock", "Phillip E Savage"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Phillip E Savage, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plasmid ultrafiltration", "Plasmid isoforms separation", "Plasmid purification", "Membrane fouling", "Backpulsing in ultrafiltration"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Forward Osmosis as a Reverse Osmosis Pre-treatment in Treating Brackish Water and Wastewater ", "id": "23524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9455", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As an increase in water demand and the lack of resources, many communities are using seawater and brackish water as their principal water source. Through years, water desalination has become more common in the water treatment field using reverse osmosis as the main technique to provide clean water to customers. However, this methodology is energy-intensive. Membrane fouling and brine disposal are also aspects of concern. In this study we evaluated the feasibility of implementing forward osmosis as a pre-treatment for the reverse osmosis desalination process. Highly salt-concentrated brackish water (retentate) from the reverse osmosis process was used as the draw solution. Secondary treatment wastewater was used as the feed solution in order to dilute the concentrated brackish water.\nLab scale experimental results showed that the average water flux of the Forward Osmosis membrane was 2.0 L/m2-hr. After 50 % dilution of total dissolved solids (TDS) on the draw solution, the membrane flux was still stable above 1 L/m2-hr. During 23 hours operation there was no observed flux decline due to membrane fouling. Experiments confirmed that the membrane flux is directly proportional to the temperature. As the temperature of the water was increase from 10 \u0366 C to 60 \u0366 C, an increment in the water flux from 1 L/m2-hr to 3 L/m2-hr was observed. Compared to temperature, pH has little effect on the membrane flux. There was no observed flux decline due to high turbidity.\nBesides stable flux and low fouling rate, the Forward Osmosis membrane used in this study also showed high pollutants rejection ratio which might transferred from the feed solution (secondary treated wastewater) to the draw solution (concentrated brackish water) through the FO membrane. It was determined that the Spectral Absorption Coefficient, using UV254 wavelength, of the draw solution increased slightly from 0.195 to 0.211 after 8 hr running, indicating that the FO membrane provided a good organic matter rejection. The Forward Osmosis membrane also proved having a good rejection of disinfection byproducts (DBPs).

Peru has not been the exception to this trend, where policies aimed at activating rural land markets have been constantly pursued since the 1990s with the hope of breaking the unequal and dualistic land distribution that characterizes the country. In light of these market-oriented land reforms, this thesis seeks to empirically examine the factors that influence the functioning of land markets in Peru, their distributional impacts, and the scope for policy to improve outcomes. Using panel data district-level information for the Peruvian Agricultural Census that spans recent liberal reforms, this thesis estimates fixed-effects regression models to compare the change in land inequality across districts and test for inter-district differences in land market activity. Our results show that despite government efforts for activating rural land markets, both sales and rental markets are still thin and have not yet generated the volume of land transfers that would be required to achieve major changes in the land structure of the country. However, we found that sales market activity is positively influenced by the levels of titling density and credit access in the district, and that these effects are even stronger when\ntitles and credit are provided together. On the other hand, our estimates suggest that although land markets have allowed land transfers from land-rich farmers to medium-sized farmers, this redistributive role is not observed in the lower end of the land distribution, where land markets seem to have failed in preventing the deepening of the fragmentation of rural property. Finally, even assuming that the land policy can correct all the relevant markets failures and substantially reduce transaction costs in land transfers, the evidence presented in this thesis suggests that land markets alone would not be enough to achieve a structural change toward a more balanced land structure. The still critical importance of other traditional sources of land access (e.g., inheritance) calls for alternative land policies that, in addition of providing the necessary conditions for land markets to perform a redistributive role, address the deepening of the fragmentation that arise due to inheritance processes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12474], "author_name_tesi": "Espinoza Hermoza, Mauricio ", "last_name_ssi": "Espinoza Hermoza", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mauricio", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephan Goetz", "Leif Jensen", "David Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephan Goetz, Thesis Advisor", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "David Abler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Land markets", "Land inequality", "Peru", "Land Fragmentation", "Land Concentration"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Bulk cavitation extent modeling: An energy-based approach", "id": "zs25x844t", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bulk cavitation is a phenomenon that occurs when a negative-pressure or tension wave causes a liquid to rupture, or cavitate, over space.

Because the coolest brown dwarfs overlap with giant planets in temperature, they can be used as proxies for studying planetary atmospheres. In multiple temperature regimes for brown dwarfs, condensates are predicted to form clouds. Based on observations of both terrestrial planets and gas giants in our solar system, clouds of water ice are likely to be a prominent constituent in the atmospheres of some brown dwarfs. If these clouds are present, they should be patchy, which should produce a variable light curve. In the last few years, a few brown dwarfs have been discovered that should be cool enough to harbor water ice clouds (< 375 K). We have searched for evidence of such clouds in the coldest known brown dwarf (~250 K) in light curves obtained at 3.6 and 4.5 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We did detect variability, but its low amplitude is difficult to explain using the theoretical models of water ice clouds unless there is only a very small deviation in cloud coverage between hemispheres. Alternatively, the similarity in mid-infrared variability amplitudes between this object and warmer T and Y dwarfs may suggest that they share a common origin for their variability (i.e., not water clouds).\nBecause brown dwarfs are the product of the process of star formation, detecting the minimum mass at which they form is a fundamental test of star formation theories. The most thorough surveys to detect this minimum mass are complete down to ~10 MJup, but have found objects with masses as low as ~5 MJup. Thus, the minimum mass has not been detected. Nearby star-forming regions are the most promising sites where large numbers of young (and hence bright) brown dwarfs <10 MJup can be found. Proper motion measurements can be used to identify new brown dwarfs in these regions. Because IRAC images are available at multiple epochs spanning a decade for most nearby sites of star formation, proper motions can be measured with these data. However, the expected motions of these regions over this time frame range from 50\u2013200 mas and the error in a typical IRAC astrometric measurement is \u223c100 mas. To more fully realize IRAC\u2019s astrometric capabilities, we have measured new distortion corrections for the 3.6 and 4.5 micron arrays. Using these corrections, we have identified a method for measuring astrometry of point sources in IRAC images that can achieve a total astrometric error of 20 mas, which is sufficiently accurate for identifying candidate brown dwarfs in nearby star-forming regions.\nWe have performed a search for planetary-mass brown dwarfs in the Chamaeleon I and Taurus star-forming regions using proper motions measured with IRAC and other wide-field surveys and using optical and near-infrared photometry. Through near-infrared spectroscopy, we have confirmed 6 and 18 candidates as new late-type members of Chamaeleon I and Taurus, respectively. These objects include the faintest known members in both regions, which should have masses of 3\u20136 MJup according to evolutionary models. Because the new brown dwarfs that we have found extend below the completeness limits of our surveys, deeper observations are needed to measure the minimum mass of star-formation in these regions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14679], "author_name_tesi": "Esplin, Taran LeRoy", "last_name_ssi": "Esplin", "middle_name_ssi": "LeRoy", "first_name_ssi": "Taran", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin Luhman", "Kevin Luhman", "Lawrence William Ramsey", "Eric D Feigelson", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera", "Jason Thomas Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin Luhman, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Chair", "Lawrence William Ramsey, Committee Member", "Eric D Feigelson, Committee Member", "Sarah Elizabeth Shandera, Outside Member", "Jason Thomas Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["open clusters and associations: general", "astrometry", "brown dwarfs", "infrared: stars", "planets and satellites: atmospheres", "solar neighborhood", "stars: low-mass", "planetary systems", "protoplanetary disks", "stars: formation", "stars: luminosity function", "stars: pre-main sequence"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "MODELING COLOR RENDITION AND COLOR DISCRIMINATION WITH AVERAGE FIDELITY, AVERAGE GAMUT, AND GAMUT SHAPE ", "id": "13478txe136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13478", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nBackground \n\nColor rendering and color discrimination are complex topics and have been the subject of many investigations. Only one color rendering metric, the CIE General Color Rendering Index (Ra), is widely accepted in the industry, despite its well-documented flaws. Despite numerous attempts by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) to update/replace the metric, they have been largely unsuccessful. The Illuminating Engineering Society (IES) has recognized the industry need for more accurate and predictive color rendition measures and recently published TM-30-15 The IES Method for Evaluating Light Source Color Rendition. \n\nThe technical memorandum (TM-30-15) outlines a two-metric system consisting of an average fidelity metric (Rf), an average gamut metric (Rg), a Color Vector Graphic (CVG), and a suite of other metrics. Rf and Rg were designed to utilize the same set of statistically selected color samples, reference source, and uniform color space such that a tradeoff between them can be explicitly demonstrated. The goal of this study was to explore these tradeoffs by modeling participant responses\u2014various subjective ratings and FM100 hue test performance\u2014under systematically varied light spectra.\nMethodology \n\nThe IES TM-30-15 Rf-Rg space was partitioned into 12 bins whose centers were the target for spectral optimization. The nominal target Rf values were 65, 75, 85, and 95. The nominal target Rg values were 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120.  Two SPDs were designated at each Rf-Rg combination to have conceptually orthogonal gamut shapes; one CVG generally oriented in the direction of hue angle bin 1 (\u2018CB1\u2019) and one generally oriented in the direction of hue angle Bin 7 (\u2018CB7\u2019). All spectra were created to be a metameric match to 3500 K blackbody radiation and calibrated to an illuminance of 600 lux. \n\nA single viewing booth was filled with 12 familiar objects with strong memory associations and which span the hue circle, as much as practically possible. Objects were chosen to fit nominally into 6 color groups: \u201cRed,\u201d \u201cOrange,\u201d \u201cYellow,\u201d \u201cGreen,\u201d \u201cBlue,\u201d and \u201cPurple.\u201d Objects were split into two categories: 1. Consumer Goods (6 objects); and 2. Natural Food (6 objects). \n\nEach of the 24 light spectra were evaluated by 20 participants. Experimentation was blocked such that 20 participants saw a randomly selected 12 of the 24 light spectra, and 20 different participants saw the other 12 light spectra. A total of 40 individuals participated in this experiment. There were 23 males and 17 females with ages ranging from 20 to 41 years and with a mean age of 26 years.\n\nThe independent variables for this experiment were Rf, Rg, and gamut shape (specified with variable CB). The dependent variables were subjective ratings of naturalness, vividness, preference, and skin preference and objective measures of color discrimination (error scores from the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue test). \n\nAnalysis\n\nSubjective ratings \nUsing a combination of best subset and stepwise regression analyses, the best fitting models for each of the subjective rating scales were determined. It was discovered that the CB variable (the nominal orientation of the CVG) did not provide the granularity needed for model prediction. The visual observation that most of the experimental CVGs can be approximated by an ellipse suggested that a best-fit ellipse approach may be suitable to quantify the shape of the CVG.  A direct least-squares fitting of an ellipse is proposed to approximate the CVGs of the 24 experimental SPDs. The resulting best-fit ellipses can be defined by the length of their semi-major axis (a), the length of their semi-minor axis (b), and their angular rotation (\u03c8). The best-fit models for each of the subjective rating scales follows: \n\nNAT = 1.464 + 0.02674 Rf + 0.188 Rcs,h1 - 15.41 (Rcs,h1)^2 \t(r-sq = 0.92)\t\n           - 0.05305 \u03c8 + 0.000602 Rf*\u03c8\n\nVIV = 3.332 + 4.594 Rcs,h16 \t(r-sq = 0.86)                                                           \n\nLIKE = 1.629 + 0.02686 Rf + 3.423 Rcs,h16 - 10.01 (Rcs,h16)^2  \t(r-sq = 0.86)\n           - 0.04866 \u03c8 + 0.000566 Rf*\u03c8\n\nSKIN = 0.128 + 3.758 b + 1.161 Rcs,h16 - 8.41 (Rcs,h16)^2  \t(r-sq = 0.85)\n\nOverall, the best-fit models demonstrate strong predictive power of the subjective responses. The bolded terms above are those which take a similar form to the models recently published by Royer and others [2016]. Every best-fit model includes some parameter extracted from the color vector graphic (either Rcs,hi and/or a best-fit ellipse parameter) and an ode to red rendering. The models presented here show marked consistency with the recent results of Royer and others. \n\nColor discrimination \nThe standard scoring software for the FM100 hue test\u2014which is often used when administering this test\u2014assumes the order of colored caps to be their order under CIE Illuminant C (under which they were designed). Direct application of the standard scoring software, therefore, assumes that the test light source does not transpose caps relative to their order under illuminant C. By directly applying the scoring software to an experiment which purposefully varies the illuminant, errors could be miscounted and the results distorted.   \n\nTo decouple the error calculation from the standard illuminant, an adjusted Total Error Score (TESadj) was computed which compared participants\u2019 responses to the correct order of colored caps under the experimental SPD (not their order under Illuminant C). Seventy percent of the experimental light sources (17 of the 24) exhibited at least one transposition relative to CIE Illuminant C. \n\nNo single metric\u2014of the main TM-30 metrics and best-fit ellipse parameters\u2014has a higher r2 than 0.57. Rg was a fairly poor predictor of TESadj (r2 = 0.47) and is consistent with recent studies that show average gamut indices are not strong indicators of color discrimination for LED light sources. The poor predictive power of the considered metrics prompted a post-hoc development of custom measures to predict TESadj based on two assumptions: (1) A light source which transposes the colored caps is more likely to cause difficulty discriminating between those caps (measured by the custom metric Rdt), and (2) A light source which compresses caps in color space will make it more difficult to discern between adjacent caps (i.e. smaller average hue angle difference, (\u2206h) \u0305_i). This custom approach to modeling the adjusted total error score demonstrates strong predictive ability (r2 = 0.87) and is significantly stronger than any single metric or metric combination considered in this study.  \n\nConclusions\n\nOverall, the importance of the CVG and red rendering is apparent. It is evident that even a two-measure system of color rendition cannot fully encapsulate the complexity of color rendering and this work confirms that the CVG is primary information. The proposed best-fit ellipse approach to the CVG provides the granularity necessary for model prediction and an objective measure to quantify its shape. Distilling the graphic into few parameters can simplify its specification.  \n\nThe results of the present study, combined with past research, suggest that it is time for researchers to abandon average fidelity and average gamut measures for the prediction of color discrimination ability of LED sources. The robust predictive power of the proposed light source transposition error score (Rdt) provides strong evidence that a more nuanced approach to predicting color discrimination is viable. With accurate methods to predict color discrimination ability, an ordinal based rating scale should be developed for ease of specification. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13628], "author_name_tesi": "Esposito, Tony ", "last_name_ssi": "Esposito", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin William Houser", "Kevin William Houser", "Richard George Mistrick", "Stephen James Treado", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin William Houser, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin William Houser, Committee Chair", "Richard George Mistrick, Committee Member", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["color rendering", "color discrimination", "fidelity", "gamut area", "best-fit ellipse", "transposition", "Rdt", "preference", "naturalness", "vividness", "skin preference"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Processing Energetic Materials with Supercritical Fluid Precipitation Techniques", "id": "15157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7672", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research has shown that nano-sized particles of explosives have a reduced sensitivity to impact and shock.  Nano-sized energetic particles have also shown promise in improving the performance of propellants and explosives.  Therefore, a method to produce nano-sized explosive particles could be ideal for sensitivity and performance reasons.  Supercritical fluid precipitation has been shown to produce nano-sized explosive particles effectively.  This research explores the feasibility of processing energetic materials using three different supercritical fluid precipitation techniques.  The first technique is called the Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution (RESS).  The RESS process dissolves a solute in a supercritical fluid and then rapidly expands the resulting solution through a nozzle to produce small (nano-sized) and uniform particles from a high degree of supersaturation.  The second technique is the Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution into a Liquid Solvent (RESOLV) Process.  This process is similar to the RESS process except the supercritical solution is expanded into a liquid and dispersant solution to reduce particle agglomeration and to reduce the size of the particles further.  The final technique investigated is the Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution with a Nonsolute (RESS-N) process in which the precipitating solute is used to encapsulate or coat a nonsoluble substance by heterogeneous nucleation.\n  This works takes both a theoretical an empirical approach.  On the theoretical side, a numerical code that accounts for nucleation and condensation in the RESS process was written in FORTRAN to predict how altering pre-expansion pressures and pre-expansion temperatures in the RESS process could affect the final particle size of the produced RDX.  It was determined that pre-expansion temperature had a marginal impact on final particle size but higher pre-expansion pressures were beneficial in forming smaller particles.  Also, a software program called STABIL\u00a9 was used to model nano-sized RDX particle interactions in a water and CO2 suspension that would be created in the RESOLV process.  STABIL\u00a9 showed that polymer coatings are absolutely necessary as particles will agglomerate within minutes if the coatings are not present.  In addition, the software program CEA was used to predict how polymer-coated RDX particles produced through the RESOLV process would perform in rocket and combustion applications.\nFor the empirical part of this work, the RESS process was used to produce nano-sized particles of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and Bis(2,2,2-trinitroethyl)-3,6-diaminotetrazine (BTAT).  Nano-sized particles of RDX were produced in the size range from 65\u00b115 nm to 105\u00b135 nm.  Slightly smaller particles were observed for higher pre-expansion pressures.  The RESS-produced RDX particles were also tested for their impact, friction, and electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitivity.  The RESS-produced RDX showed a dramatic decrease in impact sensitivity showing an increase in the 50% impact height from 17 cm to 44 cm.  The friction and ESD sensitivity of the RESS-produced RDX was approximately the same as military grade RDX particles.  BTAT particles were also produced using the RESS system.  BTAT particles showed a dramatic decrease in particle size with a more optimal round morphology at higher pressures.  The RESOLV process was used to produce well dispersed colloidal suspensions of PVP and PEI-coated RDX particles.    The RESOLV-produced particles were as small as 30 nm and fairly stable against agglomeration for extended periods of time.  Altered decomposition behavior was observed for RESOLV-produced RDX particles through analysis by differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis.  Enough PVP-coated particles were produced with the RESOLV process to send them to the Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons Division (NAWC-WD) in China Lake, California.  The PVP-coated particles showed no large differences in impact (19 cm 50% drop height instead of the standard 17 cm by ERL impact test) or ESD sensitivity (4 no-gos for NAWC ESD test) but showed a significant reduction towards initiation by friction (521 lbs threshold initiation level force instead of the standard 468 lbs by ABL friction test).  The RESS-N process was used to coat nano-sized ALEX\u00ae aluminum particles with RDX.  Coatings were observed on the ALEX\u00ae particles by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).  A method of injecting ALEX\u00ae particles into the RDX/CO2 supercritical solution was developed that was effective in coating small batches with RDX.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7608], "author_name_tesi": "Essel, Jonathan Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Essel", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo", "Kenneth K Kuo", "James Hansell Adair", "Richard A Yetter", "Stefan Thynell", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Chair", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energetic materials", "supercritical fluids", "nanotechnology", "RESS process"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "NETWORK MODELING AND TRACKING OF LIQUID PREFERENTIAL ROUTES IN\nNATURAL GAS PIPELINE SYSTEMS\n\n\n", "id": "10434", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1594", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nLiquids, water in particular, are responsible for additional pressure losses in natural gas surface production systems. For the case of natural gas stripper well facilities, the optimization of these surface fluid transportation operations is vital for a successful business. This research work is aimed at developing and testing an analytical tool able to track and map the preferential route of water in natural gas network systems so that the operator can make better decisions regarding system optimization, resulting in a more economically viable operation. The accurate mapping of the pressure, velocities of the phases and fluid re-distribution inside the network is critical, since it can reduce additional compression costs caused by the liquid phase, help to make decisions regarding water removal from the network, and also affect the design and location of surface production and separation equipment.\nThis study was undertaken in stages, starting with the development of a one-dimensional, steady state tool for modeling the flow of a single phase fluid (gas) in pipes. This model was then expanded to account for the additional pressure drop due to the appearance of multiphase flow conditions in the system by employing the Beggs and Brill model (1999). In the final stage, tee junction sequences were incorporated to create network-wide prediction capabilities. The products of each of the stages were validated and crosschecked independently and as a group with commercial simulators and field data. The present work shows that the proposed model is capable of handling two-phase splits at tee junctions, especially for the common case of uneven splits\u2014which commercially available network simulators do not model and cannot capture. As a result, the proposed multiphase network model is able to tackle realistic field scenarios where flowing phases do take their own preferential paths-resulting in sections of the network having dry and wet flow regions. The proposed model thus allows the user to effectively trace the liquid\u2018s path and plan to undertake the adequate corrective operational measures to maintain system capacity and minimize compression requirements, thereby improving the performance of the entire network.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1577], "author_name_tesi": "Essenfeld, David  ", "last_name_ssi": "Essenfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David ", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Luis Ayala", "Luis Ayala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Luis Ayala, Thesis Advisor", "Luis Ayala, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Essenfeld", "Ayala", "Panhandle", "Beggs and Brill", "Wetmouth", "Gathering System", "Natural gas", "Pipelines", "Multiphase flow", "ROute selectivity", "liquid preferential route", "tee junction"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Specific and Non-specific Interaction of M13 Bacteriophage Proteins with Inorganic Nanomaterials", "id": "18676", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8776", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The application of lessons learned from biological systems to chemistry and materials science has allowed researchers to impact technologies such as solar energy, antibacterial and stain resistant clothing, and energy storage. These biomimetic studies and techniques hold promise to address challenges present in nanomaterial synthesis and application. One biomimetic system that has been used to address these challenges is peptide phage display, in which the M13 bacteriophage virus is used to identify peptides that are specific for target materials. These peptides are then used either attached to the virus or separate from the virus for a variety of applications ranging from nanoparticle synthesis to batteries to solar energy harvest. This dissertation describes the study and use of specific and nonspecific interactions of M13 bacteriophage proteins with inorganic nanomaterials.\nWe first use the biological environment inherent for the incorporation of M13 bacteriophage \u2013 aqueous solution, room temperature, and atmospheric pressure \u2013 to synthesize metastable alloy nanoparticles of Au-Rh, Au-Pt, Pt-Rh, and Pd-Rh. By changing the ratio of the precursor metal salt solutions, the composition of the alloy nanoparticles can be tuned across the entire bulk miscibility gap. A variety of molecular and polymeric stabilizers can be used in this synthesis, and the alloy nanoparticles can be synthesized in the presence of a porous support or M13 bacteriophage. \nThe next demonstration of the usefulness of M13 bacteriophage is the use of a gold-specific peptide identified via peptide phage display as part of a system to magnetically separate non-magnetic materials. The gold-specific peptide is covalently linked to Strep Tag II, a biotin analogue that will bind strongly to streptavidin. This peptide is used to link gold nanoparticles to streptavidin-coated iron oxide particles, which can then be separated from solution using a benchtop permanent magnet. Gold nanoparticles are sequestered from solution as well as separated from a mixture of gold and cadmium sulfide or cadmium selenide nanoparticles.\nFinally, we demonstrate the ability to use isothermal titration calorimetry to semi-quantitatively study the binding of a phage display identified platinum-specific peptide to an as-synthesized platinum nanoparticles solution. The peptide is twelve amino acids long with five constituent amino acid residues \u2013 glycine, leucine, proline, lysine, and histidine. By studying the binding of these amino acids as well as small portions of the full peptide to the platinum nanoparticle solution, we find that histidine and histidine-containing peptides bind to the nanoparticle solution with exothermic heats of binding. We also study the origin of this binding and find that the major contribution is from binding of histidine to the platinum precursor still present in the nanoparticle solution. Binding of histidine to a purified nanoparticle sample is endothermic in nature with a different characteristic binding curve than for the as-synthesized nanoparticle solution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8626], "author_name_tesi": "Essinger-hileman, Elizabeth Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Essinger-hileman", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Christine Dolan Keating", "John H Golbeck", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inorganic nanomaterials", "M13 bacteriophage", "specific peptides", "material specificity", "nanoparticles", "specific peptides"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF C.

A simple model for studying all aspects of this complicated developmental process is the C. elegans vulva.  This simple epithelial tube consists of seven toroidal-shaped cells surrounding a central lumen.  Using this model, I have uncovered novel mechanisms in lumen initiation and lumen maintenance during vulval tubulogenesis.  I have shown that the putative palmitoyltransferase EGL-26, belonging to the NlpC/P60 family of enzymes, is specifically required late in dorsal vulval morphogenesis.  Moreover, I have shown that mutation of egl-26 results in a collapse of the dorsal vulval lumen.  I also show that the conserved catalytic residues of EGL-26 are required for function in vivo, providing the first example of a function for this family of proteins in metazoan development.  In addition, I have closely analyzed the role of the gonadal anchor cell in vulval morphogenesis.  Using several mutants, I have shown that invasion of the vulva epithelium by the anchor cell is required for initiation of the dorsal vulval lumen.  In cases where the anchor cell does not invade properly, no dorsal lumen is formed.  I have confirmed that this effect is specific to morphogenesis and not due to fate or polarity defects.  This work leads to a model of vulval tubulogenesis that requires the anchor cell to initiate dorsal lumen formation and EGL-26 function to maintain the lumenal structure, suggesting that initiation and maintenance are controlled separately.

In this work, organic acid probe molecules (such as trifluoroacetic acid, TFA) were used to determine the type of binding sites and the species binding to the surfaces of environmentally relevant model solids, such as kaolinite (KGa-2, KGa-1b), gibbsite and fumed silica.  These determinations of surface chemistries and \u201creactive surface area\u201d (RSA) provide a more comprehensive description of how a material will behave in the environment.  In this context, reactive surface area is a measurement of the surface sites or functional groups that directly participate in surface reactions.  Therefore, RSA represents the quantity of material available for reaction in a particular system and under specific conditions.  \nSolid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used in this work for structural information about specific nuclei and their surrounding environments, thus enabling a determination of RSA binding sites and the species being bound to the surfaces.  Bloch-decay magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments were used to study the bulk structures of the materials and to determine the coordination environments of NMR-active nuclei, such as fluorine (19F), within probe molecules.  Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Fourier-transform (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was also used (by our collaborators at PSU) to help elucidate the RSA of the environmentally relevant solids used in this work.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11197], "author_name_tesi": "Estok, Suzanne Kathryn", "last_name_ssi": "Estok", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "first_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["NMR", "surfaces", "reactivity", "oxides"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UTILITY-BASED DYNAMIC RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION IN MISSION-ORIENTED WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS", "id": "10936", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5942", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mission-oriented wireless sensor networks present an interesting class of applications, such as battlefield monitoring and emergency disaster response scenarios, that are different from conventional wireless sensor network (WSN) applications. These applications often require the network to be operational for relatively short time periods (i.e., days rather than months), and employ sophisticated, high data rate sensors (e.g., video, short aperture radar and acoustic sensors). In such mission-oriented, multi-hop WSN environments, both bandwidth and energy are critically-constrained resources that must be used judiciously. This necessitates the use of  adequate bandwidth- and energy-management algorithms that optimally control the data flows of multiple applications (called missions in this work) for ensuring that all missions obtain adequate volumes of sensor data in a timely and efficient manner. Furthermore, the missions may have different utilities, i.e., one mission may be more valuable or important than another. In such scenarios, the resource adaptation process must ensure that the resources dedicated to a mission's flows is proportional to its utility. The need for such application-level discretion, coupled with the unique challenges offered by mission-oriented WSNs render the existing resource adaptation protocols inadequate.   \n\nIn this thesis, we address these problems by developing a unified, utility-driven resource optimization framework that aims to regulate the bandwidth and energy usage of flows by dynamically adapting flow characteristics such as rate and degree of compression, in order to meet the real-time data needs of dynamic, competing missions. We develop resource adaptation algorithms that are capable of jointly optimizing under several interesting conditions that are important and unique to mission-oriented WSNs, such as prioritized missions with resource demands, and temporally-dynamic missions and network conditions. Furthermore, the algorithms are fully distributed with practically realizable protocols, which provably improve the performance of the network. As a result, we have a powerful, extensible framework, along with a suite of adaptation protocols, that is capable of proactively and comprehensively optimizing the resource usage in a mission-oriented WSN, while explicitly factoring in the application-level utility of the individual missions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5936], "author_name_tesi": "Eswaran, Sharanya ", "last_name_ssi": "Eswaran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sharanya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta", "Thomas La Porta", "Guohong Cao", "Sencun Zhu", "Tracy Mullen", "Archan Misra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas La Porta, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member", "Archan Misra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wireless networks", "resource management", "network utility", "optimization"]}]
