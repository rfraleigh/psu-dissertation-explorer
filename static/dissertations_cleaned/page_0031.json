It explores existentialist tenets in feminist ethics and care ethics and reclaims existentialism as a resourceful theory in addressing global ethical issues.  My dissertation moves beyond the once prevalent paradigm that feminist ethics should be devoid of any traditional ethical theories and it shows that an existential phenomenological ethics can complement feminist ethics in a productive way. The first chapter, introduces and discusses an existentialist notion of freedom based on Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre\u2019s writings. In order to establish that human beings are metaphysically free, I explain notions of in-itself, for-itself, transcendence, immanence, facticity, and bad faith which are the basic notions of an existentialist notion of freedom. I discuss the changes in Sartre\u2019s notion of freedom in his early and late writings and point out Beauvoir\u2019s possible influence on this change. The second chapter discusses Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s account of oppression within the framework of her existential feminist ethics. By examining her three major philosophical works which are \u2018Pyrrhus and Cineas\u2019, The Ethics of Ambiguity, and The Second Sex, I explain her notion of interconnectedness of freedom as the basic human condition and develop it as a model of relational subjectivity that constitutes the core of feminist ethics. I argue that the notion of relational subjectivity constitutes the fundamental congruence among feminist and existentialist ethics. The ways in which we relate to and deal with others determines the ethical stance we take in the world. Hence, relational subjectivity invites a broadly construed notion of responsibility as another basic component of Beauvoir\u2019s account of existentialist phenomenological feminist ethics and another point of congruence between feminist ethics and existentialist ethics. I respond the feminist critiques leveled at existentialism and defend Beauvoir\u2019s account as one that already foresees the problems in existentialist ethics and offers viable corrections to them; i.e., Beauvoir\u2019s notion of generosity as a corrective to Sartre\u2019s account of necessarily conflictual human relations.    \nMy third chapter starts with a brief history of feminist ethics and care ethics based on Carol Gilligan\u2019s and Nel Noddings\u2019 works. I show both that care ethics constitutes a preliminary and significant part of feminist ethics, yet it is surpassed by the expanding critiques and discussions in feminist ethics. Drawing on the critiques of care ethics, I examine the recurring appearance of the idealized feminine subject of patriarchy in care ethics.  I discuss Margaret Urban Walker\u2019s account of care ethics as a healthy reconstruct of care ethics alert to the potential danger of reification of patriarchal femininity in care ethics. In this chapter, I also show how existentialism plays a significance role in the formulation of care ethics especially in Noddings\u2019 work. I show that Beauvoir\u2019s account of human existence and interpersonal relations as fundamentally interconnected and interrelated through each one\u2019s freedoms and projects as it is developed in Ethics of Ambiguity and The Second Sex seems to offer a desired account that can operate within the framework of care ethics Noddings develops. In the fourth chapter, I explore Judith Butler\u2019s work on feminist ethics in relation to Beauvoir\u2019s existentialist feminist ethics. In the first section, I show how Beauvoir\u2019s account of agency as an ambiguous becoming reverberates in Butler\u2019s theory of gender performativity. In the second section, I discuss how Butler takes on some basic ethical questions concerning vulnerability and violence Beauvoir already accentuates in her writings. In my fifth chapter I discuss the strengths of the existentialist feminist ethics I develop in addressing issues in transnational feminism. I show that this account provides the ground for willing both one\u2019s self and others free and assumes responsibility to foster both. On that basis, I provide an ethical critique of an attitude of indifference, which we all as privileged people living in affluent countries enjoy, and argue for an ethical responsibility that moves us into action in the face of atrocities we witness all around the world. I emphasize that such a critique from a Western perspective should be mindful of postcolonial and hegemonic discourses that underlies such atrocities. I use Beauvoir\u2019s intervention in Djamila Boupacha\u2019s detention and torture case during the Algerian War as a historical example where that type of a critique proved to be effective. Overall, I argue that the existential feminist account of ethics I develop in my dissertation is practically efficacious in compelling us to action based on the theoretical principles of our being free and our freedoms being intertwined.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11104], "author_name_tesi": "Durmus, Deniz ", "last_name_ssi": "Durmus", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deniz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan", "Sarah Clark Miller", "John Philip Christman", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi", "Christine Clark Evans"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Wimberley Sullivan, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Clark Miller, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Robert Lambert Bernasconi, Committee Member", "Christine Clark Evans, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["existentialism", "feminism", "feminist ethics", "care ethics", "Sartre", "Beauvoir"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Italian tile samples using comparative neutron activation analysis in the Penn State Breazeale Nuclear Reactor", "id": "21255", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9975", "abstract_tesi": "Comparative neutron activation analysis (CNAA) is a powerful method that is used to determine trace element compositions of unknown samples by comparing them with known samples. This is accomplished by the activation of the samples with thermal neutrons and then subsequently measuring the corresponding delayed gamma rays. There are three principal goals achieved from this research: developing an irradiation fixture with suitable neutron fluences and large sample number capacity, characterizing the thermal neutron flux of the irradiation fixture, and determining the trace element composition of 15 Italian tiles. The Italian tiles come from two archeological sites, Tarquinia and Veii in Italy. By determining the trace element composition of the samples, the tiles can be separated into groups based on their composition. Archeologists then use the composition data to determine where material used to make these tiles and other similar artefacts originated from. Once the origins of these samples are determined other conclusions such as trade and technology transfer in the region can be drawn. In order to use CNAA at the Radiation Science and Engineering Center to determine the trace element composition of 15 Italian tile samples, an irradiation fixture and sample holder were designed and built for the Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR). This sample holder allows up to 28 samples to be irradiated simultaneously at relatively similar thermal neutron fluences. A short irradiation with a total neutron fluence of ~ 6.1 x 10^14 neutrons/cm2 and a long irradiation with total neutron fluence of ~ 5.8 x 10^17 neutrons/cm^2 were performed. The irradiation fixture is also durable and made mostly with high purity aluminum, thereby minimizing the impurities that can increase the activity of the sample holder across multiple irradiations. An encapsulation method for the samples was developed using high purity quartz ampoules to minimize the interferences in the gamma spectra as well as minimize the activity produced. The thermal and epithermal neutron flux profile of the sample holder was characterized using bare gold-aluminum wires and cadmium covered gold-aluminum wires. The total variation from highest to lowest thermal neutron flux was ~30%. Lastly, the trace element compositions of the 15 Italian tile samples were determined by CNAA. Between 13 and 16 trace elements were determined for each sample including: sodium, potassium, manganese, strontium, europium, scandium, titanium, chromium, iron, zinc, rubidium, antimony, barium, hafnium, calcium, and zirconium. The concentrations of the trace elements determined ranged from hundreds of part per billion (ppb) for antimony to tens of milligrams per gram for potassium, titanium, and iron. All other trace elements had concentrations within that range. After the trace element compositions for each sample were determined, the samples were analyzed and clustered into two groups of similar composition. Group 1 is composed of samples 139B-148B and Group 2 is composed of samples 149B-153B. Based upon comparisons with previous work Group 1 samples likely originate from Tarquinia and Group 2 samples likely originate from Veii. The elements primarily responsible for these groupings are europium, chromium, hafnium, scandium, rubidium and zirconium. Scatter plots with europium and chromium as one of the trace elements concentrations give the most distinct separation between the groupings. One exception is the zirconium plot of sample 145B, which appears to suggest that sample 145B is part of neither group. This research also corroborates the findings of previous studies and demonstrates the efficacy of CNAA as an analytical technique for determining the trace element composition of Italian tile samples.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9692], "author_name_tesi": "Durrant, Chad Bredthauer", "last_name_ssi": "Durrant", "middle_name_ssi": "Bredthauer", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Amanda Melia Johnsen", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor", "Amanda Melia Johnsen, Thesis Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["neutron activation analysis", "comparative NAA"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CHEMICAL SIGNATURES FOR UNKNOWN AND INTERDICTED SAMPLES IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR NUCLEAR FORENSIC ANALYSIS", "id": "14018cod5122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14018", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Irradiation of materials may produce unique signatures that can be measured and identified through the various types of radiation particles emitted from the materials. The emitted particles may be characteristic to specific radioisotopes thereby allowing the identification and characterization of the irradiated material. The characterization of a potentially radioactive material and then determining its origin is useful in diverse applications including nuclear forensics samples. This thesis investigates problems associated with two areas, improving the understanding of radionuclide transport in the environment and improving the speed with which samples can be chemically separated. Both topics are relevant to increasing the ability to apply nuclear forensics techniques to unknown samples in the environment.\nUnderstanding sorption and desorption processes is essential to predicting the mobility of radionuclides in the environment. Typically, such sorption reactions are studied in single mineral binary systems. This work investigates adsorption/desorption of cesium (Cs) in both binary and two-mineral \u201cternary\u201d systems in order to study component additivity, desorption kinetics and sorption reversibility in the presence of two competing minerals. First, binary Cs sorption experiments were performed with the clay minerals, illite, montmorillonite, and kaolinite, in a NaHCO3 solution over a Cs concentration range of 10-3 to 10-11 M to quantify the non-linear (illite) and linear (kaolinite and montmorillonite) sorption behavior. The binary sorption experiments were followed by desorption experiments to test for sorption reversibility. Cesium exhibits partial irreversible sorption to illite whereas Cs sorption to kaolinite and montmorillonite is reversible. In the ternary experiments, Cs was separately sorbed to illite,\niv\nmontmorillonite or kaolinite for ~14 days, and then Cs-free illite was place inside a dialysis bag (Float-a-lyzer\u00ae) inside the beaker with the pre-sorbed clays to induce desorption of the originally adsorbed Cs. Results from these ternary experiments show significantly greater Cs desorption compared to the binary desorption experiments. The ternary experiments confirm batch desorption findings of irreversible sorption of some Cs to illite and reversible sorption of Cs to kaolinite and montmorillonite.\nPlutonium (Pu), which has significantly more complex aqueous chemistry than Cs, is another radionuclide of chief concern in environmental contamination and transport scenarios. The dialysis bag experimental setup and procedure, which was designed and tested in the Cs experiments, was then applied to experiments using Pu to investigate the sorption and long-term desorption behavior of Pu in the presence of two minerals. These experiments were specifically designed to look at the long-term (7 months) reversibility of Pu sorption to montmorillonite in the presence of goethite, both common minerals in a variety of geologic environments. The distribution coefficient, Kd, of Pu sorption to montmorillonite continued to increase over the duration of the experiment, indicating that equilibrium in a ternary system is a long process occurring over several months to years. Results suggest that Pu on montmorillonite is reversible at pH 8, with up to 14 percent of the Pu desorbing from the montmorillonite and sorbing to the goethite. This would suggest that goethite may be the more important mineral influencing long-term colloid-facilitated transport of Pu.\nAdditional studies were undertaken to explore the development and testing of an automated chemical separation system for post-detonation nuclear forensic related samples. The development of this chemical separation system entailed identifying a\nv\nsuitable chemical separation sequence to sequentially separate eight elements; europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), neptunium (Np), plutonium (Pu), promethium (Pm), terbium (Tb), uranium (U), and zirconium (Zr), elements that may be of interest for post-detonation nuclear forensic analysis. A likely post-detonation situation could be in an urban environment where many samples could have a significant cement matrix associated with the sample. The chemical separation scheme would need to account for this given matrix and the large mass of associated material. To this end, batch sorption and separation experiments were conducted to examine the sorption behavior of Pu and U on AG 1x8 resin in varying concentrations of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and dissolved cement. These batch experiments were used to determine possible interferences or adverse separation effects that may result from a high concentration cement matrix. Similar batch sorption experiments with varying acid and cement concentrations were also conducted with Eu and Eichrom\u2019s LN\u00ae and TRU\u00ae resins in order to determine possible adverse consequences as a result of interferences caused by the cement.\nThe hardware for the separation system consisted of several pumps, valves, ion-exchange columns, and a fraction collector. A software program written in LabVIEW was developed to control the hardware. A test separation experiment was conducted with uranium (U), lead (Pb), and tin (Sn) isotopes to troubleshoot and test the ability of the system to sequentially separate elements. The trial run successfully separated the elements; however, several changes were made afterwards including the addition of an injection loop, a fraction collector, and changing the tubing such that eluents flowed through a more chemically inert material that was less susceptible to corrosion.\nvi\nAfter developing the chemical separation scheme and system design was finished, it was tested with five surrogate samples. The purpose of using the automated chemical separation system was to shorten the time necessary to effectively separate the eight elements of interest. The total run-time for the system was 160 minutes including sample injection, sequential separation, and wash/regeneration steps. Four of the samples had a known composition, including one that had a cement-like matrix. The elemental fractions recovered were consistent across each sample including the cement-like sample. This consistency is indicative of the robustness of the system and its ability to handle even samples with significant background mass. The final sample was of unknown composition and used to demonstrate the ability of the automated chemical separation system to sequentially separate the elements of interest and accurately determine the initial sample composition. This automated chemical separation system was a proof of concept that the eight specified elements could successfully be separated using automation and used to determine the composition of an unknown sample. Actinide recoveries were around 90% and lanthanide recoveries were around 30%.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15448], "author_name_tesi": "Durrant, Chad Bredthauer", "last_name_ssi": "Durrant", "middle_name_ssi": "Bredthauer", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Kenan Unlu", "Dr. Kenan Unlu", "Dr. Jack Brenizer", "Dr. Marek Flask", "Dr. Peter Heaney", "Dr. Annie Kersting", "Dr. Dawn Shaughnessy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Kenan Unlu, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Dr. Jack Brenizer, Committee Member", "Dr. Marek Flask, Committee Member", "Dr. Peter Heaney, Outside Member", "Dr. Annie Kersting, Special Member", "Dr. Dawn Shaughnessy, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Radiochemistry", "Sorption", "Desorption", "Cesium", "Plutonium", "Rapid Separations"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The metabolically healthy obese phenotype as a paradigm to clarify the relationship between obesity and disease ", "id": "16182", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7977", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although obesity is associated with increased risk of chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, some cancers) and mortality, a subset of the obese population presents without clinical precursors for these diseases. This phenotype is termed Metabolically Healthy Obese (MHOB). Research in this area has the potential to clarify the relationship between excess adiposity and health outcomes. However, there are still many unanswered questions about this phenotype, including: 1) how to define metabolic health, 2) whether these individuals are protected from disease risk or if it is just delayed, 3) if MHOB should be encouraged to lose weight, and 4) if differences in dietary intake could provide an explanation for the cause of their relatively healthy cardiometabolic profile. The primary objective of this work was to contribute to answering these essential ques-tions. \nPrevious research to determine if MHOB participants are protected from the in-creased disease and mortality risk usually associated with obesity is equivocal. Chapter three examined all-cause mortality risk associated with different body mass index (BMI) and metabolic health phenotypes using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)-III and the linked mortality file. Exclusion criteria included pregnan-cy, breastfeeding, incomplete data for variables of interest, BMI <18.5, and age \u226560 years (n=4373, mean\u00b1SD, age 37.1\u00b110.9 years, BMI 27.3\u00b15.8 kg/m2, 49.4% female). Metabolic health was defined using several definitions to examine the effect on prevalence and results. The definitions included: 1) homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) <2.5; 2) \u22642 Adult Treatment Panel (ATP)-III Metabolic Syndrome Criteria, and 3) a combined definition using metabolic criteria and insulin resistance. Cox propor-tional hazard regression models were used to estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for potential confounding variables. The three definitions resulted in different samples. There was little overlap in classification, with only 40 of 1160 obese participants classified as metabolically healthy by all three definitions. MHOB partici-pants were not at significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality by either the HOMA-IR or ATP-III definitions. In contrast, when metabolic health was defined using the combined definition, MHOB were at 165% elevated risk of mortality when compared to the healthy lean reference group (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% confidence interval 1.34-5.24). In conclusion, MHOB individuals risk of all-cause mortality varies depending on which definition of metabolic health is used.\nCurrent public health recommendations encourage all people with obesity to lose weight for the purpose of improving health. However, some researchers and clinicians question whether weight loss is necessary for MHOB individuals, and in one study weight loss actually caused increased insulin resistance. To examine the effect of weight loss in MHOB, the fourth chapter is a secondary analysis of a combined diet- and exer-cise-induced weight-loss intervention in overweight/obese premenopausal women with varying levels of metabolic health. Participants (n=80 completers) were asked to reduce calories and add 30-40 minutes of walking to their daily routine. This six-month interven-tion also included weekly nutrition education classes. As in the previous study, multiple definitions (the same three listed above) of metabolic health were used to allow for better comparability with the literature, and to identify the effects of multiple definitions on the results of this analysis. In comparison to the previous work, in this sample, the different definitions resulted in samples with a larger degree of overlap; 24% of women were identified as healthy by all three definitions and 64% of obese women were classified as metabolically healthy by two or more definitions. However, there was also a high rate of misclassification between definitions, 66% of participants classified as both metabolically healthy and unhealthy. The lifestyle intervention resulted in significant weight and fat loss in all participants, regardless of metabolic health status or definition used. There were no negative effects of weight loss on any of the health markers measured. The MHOB group improved both anthropometric markers of adiposity and some health markers with weight loss. These results indicate that MHOB individuals will benefit from diet- and exercise-induced weight loss. \nIn the search for what makes these individuals different, few studies have examined dietary intake in MHOB participants. Previous studies have only examined macronutrient content, finding few differences between metabolic health and BMI categories. Chapter five examines the relationship between dietary intake (nutrients and food group servings) and metabolic health and BMI status in NHANES 1999-2004 data. Metabolic health was defined as the absence of both insulin resistance (HOMA-IR <2.5) and metabolic syn-drome by the ATP-III criteria. Univariate linear regression models as well as multivariate models adjusted for potential confounders were used to identify significant differences in food group and nutrient intakes between metabolic health groups. The most robust finding was lower intake of total and red meat servings in MHOB compared to metaboli-cally unhealthy obese (MUOB) participants in both the univariate and multivariate models. These results suggest that red meat intake is related to metabolic health status in obese participants. \nOverall, these results contribute to the understanding of metabolic health in obese participants. Primary conclusions include the fact that the risk of mortality in this population is dependent on the definition of metabolic health used, and that exercise- and diet- induced weight loss produced positive anthropometric and health changes in a cohort of premenopausal women. The results presented here indicate that MHOB individuals have an intermediate metabolic health profile, healthier than MUOB participants, but more abnormal than healthy participants with lower BMIs (MHLN in chapter five and MHOW in chapter two). Based on the inconclusive nature of the literature regarding whether these individuals are protected from risk, the intermediate profile of their metabolic health profile, and the positive effects of the lifestyle intervention, MHOB individuals should be encouraged to lose weight through diet and exercise. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7924], "author_name_tesi": "Durward, Carrie Margaret", "last_name_ssi": "Durward", "middle_name_ssi": "Margaret", "first_name_ssi": "Carrie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon Nickols Richardson", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Eric Loken"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon Nickols Richardson, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["health", "Metabolic health", "obese", "obesity", "overweight", "weight loss", "survival analysis", "total mortality", "diet"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Someone's in the Kitchen: The Value of Home Cooking Traditions in the Twenty-first Century", "id": "17407", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8345", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the proliferation of convenience foods, preparing complex recipes from scratch appears to be unpopular with Americans who declare that they are \u201ctoo busy to cook.\u201d  \u201cNo one cooks anymore\u201d has become the opening line of the obituary for traditional American home cooking in the twenty-first century.

The central focus was an investigation of the proposition that the postural system controls a collective variable to realize the demands of the task.  The experimental paradigm used a set of dynamical support bases including a tilted platform (Experiment 1), a sinusoidal translating support surface (Experiment 2), and a ski-simulator (Experiment 3) to address the organization of redundant individual (dof) in the control of upright standing balance tasks.  It was hypothesized that the set of experiments would further augment our understanding regarding the mechanisms involved in the control of posture in such dynamic base of support tasks among humans.\nThe collective pattern of findings is consistent with the conclusion that the coupling of center of mass-center of pressure (Experiments 1 and 2) and the coupling of center of mass-platform (Experiment 3) act as a collective variable.  This was supported by the faster time scale motions of the joints and their synergies and reflects the structural integrity of the system for dynamic postural stability across the conducted experiments.  Furthermore, the center of mass and head reflect independent motions in the postural tasks.

Several proteins work in unison to regulate the various stages of mRNA metabolism. The Ccr4-Not complex plays roles from the \u201cbirth\u201d to the \u201cdeath\u201d of mRNAs. Dhh1, an evolutionarily conserved member of the DEAD box family in yeast, associates with the Ccr4-Not complex, and regulates both transcription and mRNA decay. Additionally, in response to cellular stress, Dhh1 localizes to P-bodies where it affects the destruction of mRNAs. By interacting with the translation machinery Dhh1 and its orthologs also play roles in translational repression. Further it also plays important roles in G1/S DNA damage checkpoint recovery. Given the many functions of Dhh1 in both the synthesis and decay of RNAs, this study seeks to examine the structural requirements for all of Dhh1\u2019s functions. Biochemical analysis of Dhh1 reveals that this protein binds RNA with high affinity but displays poor ATPase activity in vitro as compared to other DEAD box helicases. By studying the biochemical activities of Dhh1, key residues involved in ATP and RNA binding, and ATP hydrolysis have been identified. Next, this study helps dissect out how inactivation of these various biochemical activities affects the functioning of Dhh1, in vivo. In vivo analysis of mutant alleles that affect the biochemical activities has revealed the important roles of ATP binding and hydrolysis in most of the functions of Dhh1. Interestingly, the weak ATPase activity of Dhh1 is in part due to extensive inter-domain interactions, disruption of which greatly enhances ATP hydrolysis. We hypothesize that Dhh1 activity is stimulated by cellular factors, which impart a tight regulation on the functioning of this very abundant helicase.\n\tThe highly conserved Ccr4-Not complex has been ascribed many functions, from transcription regulation to mRNA decay. Initial studies described a role of this complex in preinitiation complex formation, but a number of studies have clearly shown Ccr4-Not mediates deadenylation of mRNAs and protein ubiquitylation in the cytoplasm. It is still not clear how Ccr4-Not regulates gene expression, and which of these functions are controlled directly by this complex. This study demonstrates that Ccr4-Not complex directly regulates RNAP II-dependent transcription elongation. Using purified Ccr4-Not complex and yeast RNAP II in an in vitro transcription system, the role of the Ccr4-Not complex in regulating transcription elongation has been studied. Studies show that the complex binds directly to the elongating RNAP II complex, which is partially dependent on the emerging transcript, and it also makes contacts with the emerging transcript. Using transcription run on assays, Ccr4-Not is shown to stimulate the resumption of elongation from paused RNAP II elongation complexes. Further, Ccr4-Not works co-operatively with positive elongation factor TFIIS to stimulate elongation through transcription blocks. The in vitro results are substantiated by in vivo studies, showing that Ccr4-Not co-purifies with RNAP II and associates with the open reading frames of transcribing genes. Together these studies support a model by which the Ccr4-Not complex directly associates with transcribing RNAP II and via its interaction with the emerging transcript positively regulates transcription elongation.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [403], "author_name_tesi": "Dutta, Arnob ", "last_name_ssi": "Dutta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arnob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

This may consequently affect the post-fracture productivity of the well. However, there is lack of direct quantitative and visual evidence of the extent of retention through laboratory experiments, evolution of the resulting imbibing fluid front, and how they relate to potential productivity hindrance.\n\nIn this project, laboratory experiments have been carefully designed to represent the vicinity of a hydraulic fracture. The evolution of fracturing fluid leak-off is monitored as a function of space and time using X-ray computed tomography (CT). It is generally expected for low permeability formations to show strong capillary forces due to their small characteristic pore radii, but this driving mechanism is in competition with the low permeability and spatial heterogeneities found in tight gas sands. The relevance of capillarity as a driver of fluid migration and retention in a tight gas sand sample is interpreted visually, quantified and compared with high permeability Berea sandstone in our experiments. It is seen that although these formations demonstrate strong capillarity, the effect can be suppressed by the low permeability of the formation and the heterogeneous nature of the sample. However, saturation values attained during imbibition experiments are comparable to those previously obtained for high permeability samples, which can have significant implications in terms of phase mobilities in the neighborhood of induced fractures. Leak-off of fracturing fluids during the shut-in period of a well can result in delayed gas flowback and hinder gas production.

Ethnic engagement refers to a business relationship between two individuals, which can be inter (with an individual of opposite ethnicity) or intra (with an individual of same\nethnicity). I show, the more segregated an economy is i.e., the higher is the degree of intra-relative to inter-ethnic engagements, the more conflict prone the economy is. The chances of conflict are lowered if there are inter-ethnic ties in form of social engagement, i.e. if individuals derive utility from social interactions. Absolute poverty can also play a role in precipitating conflict. I also provide an empirical analysis in the context of Hindu-Muslim violence in India. The analysis shows that higher is the\ninbreeding homophily at a place the greater is the probability of occurrence of a conflict there, which validates the main result of the paper.\n\nThe second essay, \u201cInformal Insurance and Group Size Under Individual Liability Loans\u201d is a joint work with Somdutta Basu. There has been a recent shift from joint liability to group loans with individual liability by the Grameen Bank and some other prominent micro lending institutions across the world. Under the joint liability lending mechanism a group of individuals were given a loan and individuals in a group were jointly liable for the loan given. Under the new lending regime a group of individuals are given their individual shares of a group loan. Although they have to be in a group in order to have access to the loan, individuals are not liable for the loan of other members in the group. An individual is only liable for her share of the loan. Some recent field experiments observed no change in repayment rates\nwith this regime change. This paper investigates the role of informal insurance among group members to explain the success of group lending with individual liability. In our model members of a group face idiosyncratic shocks and realization of output is private information. They can insure each other through informal arrangements in repeated interactions. This paper focuses on a repeated game analysis of both joint and individual liability group lending. We show that with informal insurance individual liability lending can lead to repayment rates as same as joint liability. However individual\u2019s welfare is strictly lower under individual liability lending. This paper also sheds light on the optimal group size that\nvillagers should maintain under the new lending mechanism.\n\nThe third essay of the dissertation is entitled \u201cUrban Ethnic Conflicts\u201d which is a joint work with Pathikrit Basu and Suraj Shekhar. Raw data on Hindu-Muslim conflict in India reveals that over 70 percent of conflicts between 1950 and 1995 took place in towns or cities. This is severely disproportionate to the fraction of Indian population living in urban areas.2 In this paper we propose a model which sheds some light on this empirical observation. Conflicts are often precipitated by false rumors. Suppose that whenever there is a false rumor there is always one person {b} who can prove that the rumor is false. Our model suggests that conflict caused by a false rumor is unlikely to happen in a small population because players meet a large fraction of the population and are therefore likely to meet\n{b}. This has two effects - not only do the players who meet {b} know that the rumor is false; they also estimate (from the commonly known meeting process) that a large part of the population must also know. This allows them to coordinate to not fight and enjoy the high peacetime payoff as opposed to the lower wartime payoff.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10114], "author_name_tesi": "Dutta, Souvik ", "last_name_ssi": "Dutta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Souvik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Barry William Ickes", "Paul L E Grieco", "Sona Nadenichek Golder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Barry William Ickes, Committee Member", "Paul L E Grieco, Committee Member", "Sona Nadenichek Golder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conflict", "Ethnicity", "Homophily", "Poverty", "Rumors", "Urban", "Individual Liability", "Group Lending", "Informal Insurance"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "NITROUS OXIDE (N2O) EMISSION FROM MINED LANDS RECLAIMED USING MANURE-BASED ORGANIC AMENDMENTS\n", "id": "12281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6323", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) and the use of fertilizers in terrestrial systems is one of the main sources. Treating mined lands with manure-based materials gives an opportunity to make use of excess nutrients of animal waste products in a nutrient-starved system. However, due to the presence of high amounts of both organic matter and nitrogen, use of these materials could create a soil environment suitable for N2O emission, an issue that has remained largely uninvestigated in reclaimed mined systems. Three experiments including one 37 day controlled laboratory incubation experiment followed by 2 field trial experiments in an active mine site at Clearfield County, Pennsylvania were conducted to address this issue. The objectives of the study were to determine if manure-based applications would produce more N2O than soils treated with inorganic amendments and non-amended soils and to examine the effects of increased C quantity and labile versus stabilized forms of C on mine soil N2O emissions at two different soil moisture conditions. Amendment materials used in the incubation experiment and field experiment 2009 included ground agricultural limestone and inorganic fertilizer (L+F), poultry layer manure (Man), manure combined with primary paper mill sludge (PMS) in C/N ratios of 14, 21, and 28 (Man+PMS14, Man+PMS21 and Man+PMS28); and composted poultry layer manure (Comp). Field experiment 2010 focused more on the C effects on N2O emissions with manure only and Man+PMS14, Man+PMS21 and Man+PMS28 amendments. Application rates of the amendments matched with application rates commonly used in mine reclamation. Manure-based amendments increased N2O emission compared to non-amended and inorganic fertilizer-treated soils under controlled laboratory conditions within the first 2 days of amendment mixing, but the response was quite short-lived. Increase in soil moisture content caused an increase in emissions. Contrary to laboratory experimental findings, field experiment data revealed very poor evidence of amendment application and soil moisture content effects on emissions. A denitrification potential experiment conducted using the soils from the same field site showed that the soil did not have the capability for denitrification even when the conditions were best suitable for denitrifying activity. The soil showed potential for denitrifying activity only when it was treated with manure-based products. Both in incubation and field experiments, manure-based materials increased the availability of substrate N. Field soil moisture data suggested that the soil dried out quickly due to coarse nature of the soil. This drying of soil diminished the difference between the moisture content of the ambient and water-added soils and created air filled pores less suitable for soil N2O production. This study demonstrated that in soils with a high percentage of coarse fragments, good drainage conditions and drying of soils reduce the chances of increased soil N2O emissions from manure-based applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6323], "author_name_tesi": "Dutta, Tanushree ", "last_name_ssi": "Dutta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tanushree", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Charles Stehouwer", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Curtis James Dell", "John Michael Regan", "Richard Charles Stehouwer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Charles Stehouwer, Dissertation Advisor", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Curtis James Dell, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Richard Charles Stehouwer, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mine land reclamation", "Nitrous oxide emissions"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "NO SECRETS TO CONCEAL: DYNAMIC ASSESSMENT AND A STATE MANDATED, STANDARDIZED 3RD GRADE READING TEST\nFOR CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES\n\n", "id": "8249", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1736", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research is to present the results of a pilot study in which a state mandated, standardized test for third grade reading/language arts was redesigned as a dynamic assessment in order to reveal the progress that children with disabilities may be making towards the goals of the general education curriculum.

In Western societies, many young people are expected to find their niche through college education or further vocational training and grow into healthy, independent, and contributing individuals. As a \u201crite of passage\u201d, entering college is associated with separation from family and friends, transition to become independent and self-regulating, and integration into a new social and academic environment. Thus, college is characterized by both increased freedoms as well as heightened need to cope with new challenges in all areas of life. Unfortunately, there are numerous data sources that indicate that being a college student is stressful and the recent rise in mental health problems has been characterized as a \u201ccrisis\u201d. When the normative developmental instability characteristic of emerging adulthood is paired with inadequate coping it provides a high-risk context for a wide range of negative consequences from poor adjustment to college, academic failure, substance abuse, to severe psychopathologies and disorders.\n\tThe purpose of this dissertation was to examine the developmental and socioemotional factors impacting transition and adjustment to college and the potential of contemplative practices to enhance first year college students\u2019 health and wellbeing during this time period. First, I theoretically analyzed the stress and coping processes during transition to college and proposed a conceptual model of how mindfulness and compassion skills may strengthen college students\u2019 coping processes before, during, and after a challenging encounter. Second, I presented the post-test outcomes of a randomized controlled trial that aimed to evaluate the Learning to BREATHE (L2B) mindfulness-based intervention in a convenience sample of 109 first year college students. The pre-post results showed that, compared to the control group, students in the intervention reported a significant decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms and increase in life satisfaction. Furthermore, we found a marginally significant decrease in sleep issues and alcohol consequences. Third, I evaluated the 3-month follow-up data of the L2B intervention and examined hypothesized factors that might mediate the outcomes. The findings showed that the assignment to the mindfulness intervention was predictive of a decrease in distress and an increase in life satisfaction at the 3-month follow-up. Furthermore, the increase in reported mindfulness states mediated the outcome of distress, but not life satisfaction. The greater use of mindfulness practices mediated both distress and life satisfaction outcomes at follow-up. I concluded that mindfulness-based practices may positively impact both prevention of students\u2019 mental health issues and promotion of their socioemotional competencies.\n\tGiven the current issues with worldwide instabilities, 21st century education needs to be multifaceted, providing youth with the necessary cognitive and socioemotional skills to face the increasingly more complex and fast-paced world. For young adults to become engaged citizens of our global society, essential aspects of their education need to include the development of inner clarity, compassion, and self-awareness. Mindfulness and compassion practices and skills may offer a developmental resource for handling both daily hassles as well as major transitions and life events through the combined effect of paying attention, regulating thoughts and emotions, and utilizing effective coping tools. Creation of mindful and compassionate communities may be the next step in the broader contemplative agenda that will allow young people to practice inner clarity, socioemotional competencies, and the desire to work together for the greater wellbeing of all. I look forward to that hopeful future.

Various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction, calorimetery, electron microscopy, dielectric and piezoelectric measurements have been performed to determine the details of the phase diagram, crystal structure, and domain structure. The selection of these materials is based on the hypothesis that the presence of BZT-PT (Case I ferroelectric (FE)) will increase the transition temperature of MPB systems BMT-PT (Case II FE), and PZ-PT (Case III FE), and subsequently a MPB will be observed in the ternary phase diagrams. The Case I, II, and III classification has been outlined by Stringer et al., is on the basis of the transition temperatures (TC) behavior with composition in the Bi and Pb oxide based binary systems.\n\tSeveral pseudobinary lines have been investigated across the xBZT-yPZ-zPT ternary phase diagram which exhibit varied TC behavior with composition, showing both Case I- and Case III-like TC trends in different regions. A MPB between rhombohedral to tetragonal phases has been located on a pseudobinary line 0.1BZT-0.9[xPT-(1-x)PZ].  Compositions near MPB exhibit mainly soft PZT-like properties with the TC around 60oC lower than the unmodified PZT near its MPB. Electrical properties are reported for the MPB composition, TC = 325oC, Pr = 35 &#956;C/cm2, d33 = 300 pC/N and kP =0.45. Rhombohedral compositions show diffuse phase transition with small frequency dispersion, similar to relaxors. Two transition peaks in the permittivity as well as in the latent heat has been observed in some compositions near the BZT-PT binary. This leads to the speculation for the existence of miscibility gap in the solid solutions in these regions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) performed on these compositions show subdomain modulation contrast suggesting the presence of localized and correlated spatial fluctuations in the spontaneous strain.\n\tIn the xBMT-yBZT-zPT system, very small rhombohedral region in the room temperature phase diagram has been observed. Owing to the limited solid solubility, only a part of the phase diagram could be explored. Compositions on pseudobinary xPT-(1-x)[0.9BMT-0.1BZT] has been successfully fabricated and characterized. High c/a ratio of 1.04 has been observed for a surprisingly low tolerance factor of 0.9732. Transition temperature trends have been established from DSC and dielectric data along this pseudobinary line. The following trend in the TC has been observed with the increase in non PT end member that has been divided into three zones: in Zone I TC increases, in Zone II it decreases, and in the Zone III, two transition temperatures are observed. From the TEM investigation, it has been noted that these compositions exhibit subdomain modulations which reflects the presence of spontaneous strain. These modulations increase with the increase in non PT end member, and at certain composition along pseudobinary, both macro and micro domains structure can be observed. Compositions in the rhombohedral phase of xBMT-yBZT-zPT show dramatic changes in dielectric and piezoelectric properties when quenched from high temperature. Samples quenched from temperature range 650oC-900oC show classical ferroelectric switching behavior, which is not observed on either side of this temperature range. These quenched states are however, unstable in nature and lose their ferroelectric properties when heated to a temperature as low as 400oC.

Scholars view it as the most important institution in the complex process of knowledge creation and distribution. Such assertions, however, directly contradict the projections made by others that university campuses will soon be relics or that the sector will collapse under its own weight within next few decades. A closer examination of these contradictions reveals that the perspectives driving such projections often adopt an economic outlook, mostly focusing on higher education\u2019s rising cost, and compare the sector with commercial industries such as manufacturing or services that were disrupted with emergence of online technologies. While such an outlook explains some recent transformations, it doesn\u2019t acknowledge the sector\u2019s challenges beyond economic sustainability, and, therefore, fails to guide future policy for its broader role in our society. Several scholarly reflections reinforce this outlook by arguing that higher education is losing its academic and social priorities and gravitating toward the dictates of the marketplace.\nIn this research, I argue that the higher education sector needs a broader range of perspectives to capture its dynamics comprehensively and, therefore, I engage the theory of institutional logics to view higher education as a complex system of multiple institutional logics. I then use the theory of mediatization to shift the focus from its cost to its content ,which offers an alternate view. It allows for the drawing of parallels with other cultural institutions, such as the performing arts of music and theater, that underwent mediatization when their content was mediated by recording technologies. The traditional models of content exchange in these cultural institutions (in face-to-face settings) were disrupted when their content was captured, recorded, and disseminated virtually. Scholarly accounts of these events in cultural and media studies reveal many parallels and suggest that higher education is also a cultural institution, primarily because it engages in the creation and distribution of symbolic content. \nTo explore this perspective, I conducted a multi-level, multi-case qualitative field study. The setting for the research included higher education organizations across three categories: public non-profit, private non-profit, and private for-profit, with two organizations in each category representing resident and online education as the dominant mode of teaching. A specific program was chosen from each organization as the unit of analysis. To capture the field-level phenomenon, I conducted an archival analysis of documents published by field agencies. \nThe results reveal six prevailing institutional logics that influence the teaching practice \u2013 Academic, Social, Community, State, Corporation, and Market. Increasing online adoption reveals the emergence of a seventh logic that I term the Cyber-Cultural logic. It focuses on student engagement and leverages cyber technologies to digitize, distribute, personalize, track, and adapt the instructional content. Increasing production of videos with experts from disciplines such as entertainment and media to create engaging instructional content reflects the cultural element. The use of virtual interactivity, learning analytics, and predictive algorithms reflects the cyber element. Further, each of these seven institutional logics is explicated and analyzed in terms of how it co-exists, conflicts, and evolves with others. The lens of mediatization reveals how online education has led to the emergence of an alternate world of higher education, comprising instructional content providers and credit-recommendation agencies. While on one hand it is trying to disrupt the traditional educational models, on the other it is leveraging academic strength to gain legitimacy. \nIn this way, this research makes several theoretical, as well as practical, contributions. It broadens our perspective by identifying multiple institutional logics prevailing in the higher education sector. It offers their in-depth explication and an integration between the theories of institutional logics and mediatization in the context of higher education. The findings reveal the complexity of contemporary transformations that call for engaging multiple perspectives to bring sustainable change. They also bring to light why projections solely based on narrow economic outlooks fail to be realized and how they can potentially misguide the discourses that shape future policy. This comprehensive view can guide our efforts to transform higher education without compromising the foundational values that have made it one of the most enduring and esteemed sectors in the world.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14797], "author_name_tesi": "Dwivedi, Neelam ", "last_name_ssi": "Dwivedi", "first_name_ssi": "Neelam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang", "Dr. Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang", "Dr. Sandeep Purao", "Dr. Eileen Trauth", "Dr. Rayne Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Xiaolong (Luke) Zhang, Committee Chair", "Dr. Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Dr. Eileen Trauth, Committee Member", "Dr. Rayne Sperling, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Higher education", "online education", "mediatization", "institutional logic", "teaching practice"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SHE WHO KEEPS A COOL HEAD PREVAILS EXAMINING HOW SELF-REGULATION ALLOWS WOMEN LEADERS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN EXECUTIVE ROLES", "id": "14393pzd110", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14393", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An ever-increasing number of women are being appointed as CEOs of large organizations, yet very little is known about the factors that contribute to their success.

Previously, we demonstrated this vestibulosympathetic reflex (VSR) elicits increases in MSNA during baroreflex unloading (i.e., lower-body negative pressure) in humans. Whether such an effect persists during baroreflex loading is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the ability of the VSR to increase MSNA is preserved during baroreflex unloading and inhibited during baroreflex loading. Ten subjects (26\u00b11 yr) performed 3 trials of head-down rotation (HDR) to activate the VSR. These trials were performed after a period of sustained saline (control), nitroprusside (baroreflex unloading: 0.8-1.0 &#956;g/kg/min), and phenylephrine (baroreflex loading: 0.6-0.8 &#956;g/kg/min) infusion. Nitroprusside infusion decreased (&#8710;7\u00b11 mmHg; p<0.001) and phenylephrine infusion increased (&#8710;8\u00b11 mmHg; p<0.001) mean arterial pressure at rest. HDR performed during the control (&#8710;3\u00b12 bursts/min, &#8710;314\u00b1154 arbitrary units (au) total activity, &#8710;41\u00b118% total activity; p<0.05) and nitroprusside trials (&#8710;5\u00b12 bursts/min, &#8710;713\u00b1241 au total activity, &#8710;49\u00b120% total activity; p<0.05) increased MSNA similarly despite significantly elevated levels at rest (13\u00b12 to 26\u00b13 bursts/min) in the latter. In contrast, HDR performed during the phenylephrine trial failed to increase MSNA (&#8710;0\u00b11 bursts/min, &#8710;-15\u00b133 au total activity, &#8710;-8\u00b121% total activity). These results confirm previous findings that the ability of the VSR to increase MSNA is preserved during baroreflex unloading. In contrast, the ability of the VSR to increase MSNA is abolished during baroreflex loading. These results provide further support for the concept that the VSR may act primarily to defend against hypotension in humans.\nAbstract Chapter 3 \u2013 Orthostatic intolerance is a common problem following bed rest. The mechanism for this is equivocal. Vestibular reflexes contribute to orthostatic blood pressure regulation. We hypothesized that sympathetic nerve responses to otolith stimulation would be attenuated by prolonged head-down bed rest (HDBR) and that this attenuation would be associated with increased orthostatic intolerance. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), and peripheral vascular conductance were measured during head-down rotation (HDR; otolith organ stimulation) in the prone posture before and after short-duration (24-hrs; n=22) and prolonged (36\u00b11 days; n=8) HDBR. Head-up tilt at 80o was performed to assess orthostatic tolerance. After short-duration HDBR, MSNA responses to HDR were preserved (&#8710;5\u00b11 bursts/min, &#8710;53\u00b113 % burst frequency, &#8710;65\u00b113% total activity; p<0.001). No association was observed between the vestibulosympathetic reflex and head-up tilt duration. After prolonged HDBR, MSNA responses to HDR were attenuated ~50%. MSNA increased by &#8710;23\u00b113% burst frequency and &#8710;34\u00b122% total activity during HDR. Moreover, these results were observed in 3 subjects tested again at 75\u00b11 days of HDBR. This reduction in MSNA responses to otolith organ stimulation at 5 weeks was associated with reductions in head-up tilt duration. These results indicate that prolonged HDBR (~5 wks) attenuates the vestibulosympathetic reflex and contributes to orthostatic intolerance following HDBR in humans. These results suggest a novel mechanism in the development of orthostatic intolerance in humans.\nAbstract Chapter 4 \u2013 Classically, the glycerol dehydration test (GDT) has been used to test for the presence of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease and can cause acute alterations in vestibular reflexes in both normal and pathological states. The vestibulosympathetic reflex (VSR) elicits increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and peripheral vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that the GDT would attenuate the VSR through an acute fluid shift of the inner ear. Nine male subjects (27\u00b11 years) performed head-down rotation (HDR), which engages the VSR, before and after administration of either the GDT or saline. MSNA (microneurography), arterial blood pressure, and leg blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) were measured during HDR. Before drug administration, HDR significantly increased MSNA in burst frequency (&#8710;5\u00b11 bursts/min, &#8710;8\u00b11 bursts/min; p<0.01) and total activity (&#8710;44\u00b113%, &#8710;77\u00b117%; p<0.01), and decreased calf vascular conductance (&#8710;15\u00b16%, &#8710;20\u00b13%; p<0.01), in both the saline and glycerol trials, respectively. Post-saline, HDR still significantly increased MSNA (&#8710;6\u00b12 bursts/min, &#8710;83\u00b120% total activity; p<0.01) and decreased calf vascular conductance (&#8710;21\u00b14%, p<0.01), which was not significantly different from pretesting. In contrast, post-GDT resulted in an attenuation of MSNA (&#8710;3\u00b11 bursts/min, &#8710;22\u00b13% total activity) and reduction in calf vascular conductance (&#8710;7\u00b14%) during HDR. These results suggest that a fluid shift of the inner ear via glycerol dehydration attenuates the VSR. These data provide support that dynamic fluid shifts can have a significant effect on the VSR.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1404], "author_name_tesi": "Dyckman, Damian Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Dyckman", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Damian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chester A Ray", "Charles H Lang", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Lawrence Isaac Sinoway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chester A Ray, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Member", "Lawrence Isaac Sinoway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vestibular", "orthostasis", "bed rest", "blood pressure regulation", "vestibulosympathetic reflex", "MSNA", "HDR"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Dynamic balance of ballroom dancers and soccer players", "id": "26585", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is commonly believed that improved balance can enhance athletic performance and reduce injury risk. Some dance styles have overall lower injury rates than other sports, and dancers perform better during balance tests compared to other athletes. This has lead coaches to believe dance training can improve balance, coordination and performance in athletes of other sports; however the research comparing dance and athletic populations has provided inconclusive results. The purpose of this research was to compare the dynamic balance abilities of ballroom dancers and soccer players by using three different dynamic balance tests. In this study, we hypothesized that the ballroom dancers would have better balance over a stable base of support, but that soccer players would have better balance during changes in base of support. Three tests, a modified Star Excursion Balance Test, Step and Balance Test, and Balance Beam Test, were selected for this study to assess different aspects of dynamic balance used in sports.  All tests were timed to emphasize stability when speed was important. Thirty recreational athletes (15 ballroom dancers and 15 soccer players) performed three balance tests while a researcher recorded the time to complete trials and the number of errors committed during trials. A Mann-Whitney test was performed to compare the median times and errors committed for each test between the two groups. The investigators found no significant difference in times or errors for any test between the two groups.  The findings indicate the training received in both soccer and ballroom dance may lead to similar balance abilities, and that athletes pursuing cross-training to improve balance may see equal results by training in either soccer or ballroom dance. Findings may also suggest that ballroom dancers may possess different balance abilities than ballet and modern dancers.

Our understanding of the nature of these relationships has been limited by the lack of craft production evidence for many of the exotic artifacts found far from their raw material source. The discovery of an intact sequence (800 \u2013 400 cal BC) of refuse deposits at Las Orqu\u00eddeas, Imbabura, Ecuador, filled with waste from crafting both local and non-local materials provides an unparalleled opportunity to better characterize interregional interaction in the Ecuadorian Late Formative. \n\tI argue that a gift economy based in household craft production and down-the-line exchange networks best explains the documented evidence at Las Orqu\u00eddeas and contemporaneous sites throughout the northern Andes. At Las Orqu\u00eddeas, refuse from the production of items such as rectangular Spondylus adornments, mother-of-pearl plaques, gold adornments, and stone beads is found alongside dense concentrations of domestic waste. This suggests that craft production on site was conducted in household contexts. \n\tLas Orqu\u00eddeas was a central node in Late Formative exchange networks as demonstrated by the wide array of objects found in excavations. A reconsideration of recent radiocarbon dates suggests that La Tolita on the northern Ecuadorian coast might have been another key center in these systems. Prehispanic populations living between major sites added various products to the networks as coastal and highland items moved through. Examples of these additions would be coca, land snail shells, and cotton. I propose that the reason that the Late Formative population at Las Orqu\u00eddeas wanted shell raw material (e.g. Spondylus and mother-of-pearl) rather than finished jewelry was to produce geometric adornments for exchange in a north-south network. \n\t  Beyond this central argument, a number of other topics are considered. A cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire analysis of crafting in obsidian, Spondylus, and mother-of-pearl at Las Orqu\u00eddeas constitutes a major component of this research. I also address the issue of change over time in craft production and interregional interaction within Las Orqu\u00eddeas as well as the greater northern Ecuadorian highlands. One important discovery is that crafting with non-local raw materials first appears at Las Orqu\u00eddeas from 550 \u2013 400 cal BC. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15046], "author_name_tesi": "Dyrdahl, Eric R", "last_name_ssi": "Dyrdahl", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "David Webster", "Sarah Barbara Mcclure", "Maureen Feineman", "Matthew Bennett Restall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "David Webster, Committee Member", "Sarah Barbara Mcclure, Committee Member", "Maureen Feineman, Outside Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Archaeology", "Ecuador", "Late Formative", "Craft Production", "Interregional Interaction", "Gift Economy", "Obsidian", "Spondylus", "Mother-of-Pearl", "Anthropology", "Latin American Studies", "Highlands"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "PENALIZED QUADRATIC INFERENCE FUNCTIONS FOR VARIABLE SELECTION IN LONGITUDINAL RESEARCH", "id": "7084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For decades, much research has been devoted to developing and comparing variable\nselection methods, but primarily for the classical case of independent observations.\nExisting variable-selection methods can be adapted to cluster-correlated observations,\nbut some adaptation is required.

These conditions are characterized by an immune response directed towards a non-pathogenic stimulus, leading to inflammation and the symptoms of allergy. An important step in this process is the production of inflammatory mediators, such as the cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), by T-cells. This small protein promotes inflammation by recruiting additional immune cells, stimulating production of allergic IgE antibodies, inducing epithelial cells to produce inflammatory mediators, and inducing contraction of smooth muscle cells within the airway. Understanding regulation of these inflammatory mediators at the cellular level offers a promising target for the treatment of allergic disease. Post-transcriptional regulation (PTR) of cytokines such as IL-13 is emerging as a crucial component of immune regulation. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that IL-13 is post-transcriptionally regulated and to characterize the mechanisms by which this occurs.

As a result, little research has been conducted examining the Asian experiences of anger and aggression.  Much of the research that has been conducted has been based upon the assumptions that: 1) Asian cultural values include the belief that aggression is unacceptable and results in serious negative consequences and 2) that these beliefs consequently serve as a protective factors against aggression in this population (e.g., Nagayama Hall, Sue, Narang, & Lilly, 2000; Nagayama Hall et al., 2005). However, the validity of these assumptions has not been examined empirically. In the present study, Caucasian and Asian/Asian American participants were asked to rate their tendencies to experience anger, their perceptions of the acceptability of and consequences for aggressing, and their engagement in aggression. The results revealed that, contrary to the predominant stereotypes, Asians/Asian Americans reported engaging in greater direct aggression and found aggression to be more acceptable than Caucasians. Furthermore, endorsement of Asian American values was related to greater reports of engagement in indirect aggression in the Asian sample; however, the belief that aggression is unacceptable served as a protective factor in the relationship between anger and indirect aggression in this group. Finally, whereas these beliefs protected those of Asian decent from engaging in direct aggression when their trait-anger was low, the anticipation of severe consequences for aggression did so when their trait-anger was high. The implications of these findings with respect our understanding of the Asian/Asian American experience, future research and clinical approaches are discussed. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1731], "author_name_tesi": "Dzus, Ellen Elsie", "last_name_ssi": "Dzus", "middle_name_ssi": "Elsie", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman", "Thomas D Borkovec", "Jose Angel Soto", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Gayle Newman, Committee Chair", "Thomas D Borkovec, Committee Member", "Jose Angel Soto, Committee Member", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["anger", "aggression", "attitudes", "values", "beliefs", "Asian"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Nonmedical Exemptions to Vaccination in Illinois: A Multi-scalar Analysis", "id": "28746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12274", "abstract_tesi": "The CDC publishes annual estimates of school-age children vaccination rates that are high at the federal-level, yet, vary significantly at lower scales.

This question has spatial and temporal scale aspects.

Polymers are used to provide lubrication during shaping and handling strength to the shaped component. After shaping, the polymers are removed from the shaped components by providing thermal energy to burnout the polymers. Polymer burnout is one of the most critical step in powder metal processing. Improper design of the polymer burnout cycle will result in formation of defects, shape loss, or carbon contamination of the components\n\tThe effect of metal particles on polymer burnout and shape loss were addressed in the present research.  The study addressing the effect of metal powders on polymer burnout was based on the hypothesis that metal powders act to catalyze polymer burnout. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on pure polymer, ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), and on admixed powders of 316L stainless steel and 1 wt. % EVA were carried out to verify the hypothesis. The effect of metal powders additions was studied by monitoring the onset temperature for polymer degradation and the temperature at which maximum rate of weight loss occurred from the TGA data. The catalytic behavior of the powders was verified by varying the particle size and shape of the 316L stainless powder. The addition of metal particles lowered the polymer burnout temperatures. The onset temperature for burnout was found to be sensitive to the surface area of the metal particle as well as the polymer distribution. Powders with low surface area and uniform distribution of polymer showed a lower burnout temperature.\nThe evolution of shape loss during polymer burnout was based on the hypothesis that shape loss occurs during the softening of the polymer and depends on the sequence of chemical bonding in the polymer during burnout.  In situ observation of shape loss was carried out on thin beams compacted from admixed powders of 316L stainless steel and 1 wt. % ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). The results showed that shape loss primarily occurs by viscous creep during the softening of the polymer.  At the onset of burnout of EVA, a recovery in shape loss was observed. The recovery occurred primarily during the first stage burnout of EVA and was attributed to the formation of polyethylene co-polyacetylene which forms with a carbon double bond.  The in situ strength was also found to increase during the formation of polyethylene co-polyacetylene.  No recovery of shape loss was observed during burnout of polymers (polyethylene and polypropylene) which convert to yield hydrocarbons without forming carbon double bonds. The critical stages for shape loss during polymer burnout were identified in the present study. The shape loss profile and the viscosity evolution during polymer softening was modeled. One implication of the current research would be significantly improved dimensional control (possibly with carbon contamination) would be possible in powder metallurgy by the selection of polymers that form double bond during burnout, such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), vinyl acetate (VA), etc.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5204], "author_name_tesi": "ENNETI, RAVI KUMAR", "last_name_ssi": "ENNETI", "middle_name_ssi": "KUMAR", "first_name_ssi": "RAVI", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randall M German", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "David John Green", "Renata S Engel", "Ivica Smid"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randall M German, Committee Chair", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "David John Green, Committee Member", "Renata S Engel, Committee Member", "Ivica Smid, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Powder metallurgy", "polymer burnout", "stainless steel", "shape loss"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Preschool Teachers' Emotional Experience Traits, Awareness of Their Own Emotions, and Their Emotional Socialization Practices ", "id": "7660", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1871", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emotions are composed of three interrelated sets of processes, which are (a) neurophysiologic and biochemical processes, (b) motor and behavioral expressive processes, and (c) cognitive-experiential processes.

In addition, individuals\u2019 attention to their own emotions and their clarity of their own emotions are two aspects of these individuals\u2019 awareness of their own emotions.\nThe current study is composed of three phases-questionnaires, observations, and interviews- to investigate preschool teachers\u2019 emotional experience traits, their awareness of their own emotions, and their emotional socialization practices. The results of this study revealed that if preschool teachers attended to their own emotions, they were more likely to refer to children\u2019s emotions and less likely to minimize their emotions. Moreover, preschool teachers who experienced their negative emotions intensely tended to use punishment for children\u2019s display of anger.

As a consequence of scaling, electron scattering\nboth at grain and interface boundaries results in higher resistivity. This is\nposing a problem for copper interconnect even in the near term. Researchers are\nstudying interconnect alternatives ranging over the time line. It is important to\nunderstand the total system concept of performance, area, power, reliability, and\nprocess variability for each of these alternatives. The goal of this dissertation is\nto analyze an emerging technology alternative from a system perspective and tune\nthe architecture to fully harness the benefits provided by the new interconnect\ntechnology. We study three emerging interconnect technologies namely bundles\nof Single Walled Carbon Nanotube (SWCNT), Radio frequency (RF-I) and three\ndimensional (3D) die stacking. SWCNT are shown to possess high electrical and\nthermal conductivity and thus is envisioned as a possible replacement for copper\ninterconnect in the far-term. We apply SWCNT to interconnect dominated\nFPGA platform and explore the routing fabric design space to leverage the benefits\nprovided by SWCNT. We find that SWCNT prefers longer length segments\nand lesser number of contacts when area and performance are chosen as the key\nmetrics for comparison. SWCNT are expected to have high process variability and\nwhen timing yield of the FPGA was also considered for comparison, smaller length\nsegments were preferred. Thus, reliability and performance trade-offs are studied.\nSince SWCNT gives more delay benefit for long lengths, we also use it in clock\nnetworks and demonstrate significant power and area benefits.\nDue to the power budget constraints, System-on-Chip (SoC) and multicore\nsystems have also emerged to be communication-oriented. Packet based on chip\ninterconnection networks are being used as the communication media. Network\nlatency, throughput and power will play a vital role in system design. RF-I can provide high bandwidth at small latency across the length of the chip. We study\nthe impact of applying RF-I for various topologies and traffic workloads. At small\nnetwork sizes, RF-I yields both latency and throughput benefits and at larger network\nsizes latency benefits are observed. The throughput benefits diminish at the\nlarger network sizes as the congestion over long distances close to saturation increases\nthe probability of deadlocks for a flat topology. During deadlock recovery,\nRF bandwidth is not used and without the extra BW support at the high load\nrates the network quickly saturates. On the other hand, concentrated and hierarchical\ntopologies lead to smaller network diameter. Consequently, these topologies\ncan take better advantage of RF-I. In addition, hierarchical designs are throughput\nconstrained and thus, it can benefit from the high BW of the RF-I. Following\nthis, we consider three dimensional stacking that is envisioned to play a critical\nrole in the design of SoC and multicore systems. We designed a 3D multilayered\nrouter for on-chip networks that is motivated by the observation that Non-uniform\ncache (NUCA) communication traffic has many short flits and frequent patterns.\nConsequently, we can shut off the bottom layers to save power. Novel technologies\nopen up a lot of opportunities and architectural challenges. These studies show\nthat it is essential to design the system architecture ahead of time of the technology\nand characterize the system with respect to various design metrics. The\ntechnology assumptions should be broad enough to take into account the changes\nin the emerging technology.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5775], "author_name_tesi": "Eachempati, Soumya Siva", "last_name_ssi": "Eachempati", "middle_name_ssi": "Siva", "first_name_ssi": "Soumya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Yuan Xie", "Chitaranjan Das", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Suman Datta", "Heng Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Yuan Xie, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon nanotube", "radio frequency", "FPGA", "network on chip"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Combinatorics and Representation Theory for Generalized Permutohedra", "id": "13627nje112", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13627", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we study the representation theory of the symmetric group on a new categorification of the theory of generalized permutohedra.  The vector spaces in the categorification are tightly constrained, arising as solution spaces to certain continuity relations which appeared first in Quantum Field Theory in the mid 20th century.  The generators of the vector space are characteristic functions of certain polyhedral cones called plates, due to A. Ocneanu.\n\nIn combinatorics, the Eulerian numbers count the number of permutations with a given number of ascent and descents.  The classical Worpitzky identity in combinatorics expands a power $r^p$ as a sum of Eulerian numbers, with binomial coefficients.  The main combinatorial result is the categorification of Worpitzky's identity to an isomorphism between two graded representations of the symmetric group, corresponding geometrically to the decomposition of a scaled simplex into a direct sum of translated unit hypersimplices.  We recover the classical Worpitzky identity by evaluating the characters on the identity permutation.  The character values in general can be interpreted as relative volumes of generalized hypersimplices.\n\t\t\nThe proof involves a new algebra of commuting operators which act by translation on plates in a scaled simplex.\nWe show that the spectrum of this algebra is labeled by the subset $\\{x\\in(\\mathbb{Z}\\slash r)^n:\\sum x_i\\equiv 1\\},$ on which $S_n$ acts by permuting positions.  The values of the character of a permutation $\\sigma$ is thus given by the number of fixed points on this set.

Besides multiple genetic factors, environmental factors such as early life stress are believed to increase vulnerability for anxiety and mood disorders. Early life stress has been shown to modulate the stress response in adulthood through changes in gene expression and changes in neurotransmitter systems. Stress, including especially early life stress, is also a potent inhibitor of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a mechanism that has been implicated in the etiology of depression. Conversely, deficits in neurotransmission, including neurotransmission by ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the cortex and hippocampus are implicated in the etiology of anxiety and depressive disorders. GABA type A (GABAA) receptors are key control elements of anxiety states based on the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines (BZs), which act as allosteric GABAA receptor agonists.\n \nHeterozygous deletion of the ?2 subunit of GABAA receptors results in modest but significant deficits in BZ binding sites as well as altered channel conductance, deficits in trafficking and clustering of GABAA receptors at postsynaptic sites. However, there is no change in the number of GABA binding sites indicating that the number of GABAA receptors was unaltered in these mice. This subtle deficit in GABAA receptors is associated with behavioral, pharmacological and cognitive alterations indicative of elevated trait anxiety. The ?2+/- mice exhibit neophobia and marked behavioral avoidance to natural or learned stressors. This phenotype is reversed to wildtype (wt) levels following BZ treatment reflecting sensitivity of pathologically anxious patients to anxiolytics. Altered behavior of ?2+/? mice is associated with cognitive deficits including enhanced 1-s trace conditioning and impaired ambiguous cue conditioning but unimpaired spatial memory. \n\nIn the present thesis, cell-type-specific and developmentally controlled inactivation of the ?2 subunit gene was used to further analyze the mechanism underlying anxiety-like behavior of ?2+/? mice. Recombination of a \u2018floxed\u2019 ?2 subunit (f?2) allele in either of two different Cre-expressing mouse lines results in a reduction of GABAA receptors specifically in glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain. In adulthood, Emx1Cre x f?2/+ and CaMKIICre2834 x f?2/+ mice exhibited comparable deficits in BZ binding in the forebrain. Specifically, both mouse lines showed substantial reductions in BZ binding in the forebrain, including the cortex, CA1 region of the hippocampus and striatum, with less severe deficits in the amygdala and the dentate gyrus. However, in Emx1Cre mice Cre-mediated recombination occurs in immature glutamatergic neurons of the embryonic and adult forebrain while in CaMKIICre2834 mice recombination is developmentally delayed to mature neurons of the adult brain. \n\nThe GABAA receptor deficits in immature glutamatergic neurons of the embryonic forebrain resulted in heightened anxiety-like behavior similar of that seen previously in ?2+/? mice. This included increased risk assessment behavior and neophobia in paradigms without an implicit threat and increased avoidance to naturally aversive stimuli. In addition, Emx1Cre x f?2/+ mice and ?2+/? mice showed increased behavioral inhibition in paradigms with predictive validity for antidepressant drug effects in humans. By contrast, the developmentally delayed GABAA receptor deficit of CaMKIICre x f?2/+ mice was without behavioral effect. Thus, the first three weeks of life represent a GABAA receptor dependent critical period in the establishment of normal emotionality of mice.\n\nIn addition to behavioral deficits, ?2 subunit inactivation in immature forebrain glutamatergic neurons was associated with significant deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Decreases in adult born neurons in the adult hippocampus were associated with normal cell proliferation, but a reduction in the number of cells expressing mature neuronal markers. Reductions in neurogenesis were characterized by normal proliferation and initial neuronal differientiation, indicating a selective vulnerability of maturing neurons to modest functional deficits in GABAA receptors. By contrast, a developmentally delayed GABAA receptor deficit in mature glutamatergic neurons of the forebrain did not affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore, normal emotionality and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have in common that they are dependent on developmental GABAA receptor in immature glutamatergic neurons. Thus, GABAA receptor deficits in immature neurons of the developing and/or adult brain are implicated in the etiology of heightened negative emotionality, which in humans is associated with generalized anxiety disorder and major depression.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2577], "author_name_tesi": "Earnheart, John Clinton", "last_name_ssi": "Earnheart", "middle_name_ssi": "Clinton", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Randen Patterson", "Byron C Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Randen Patterson, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hippocampal neurogenesis", "brain development", "anxiety disorder", "conditional knockout mouse", "depression"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Contextualizing Pedagogical Capacity: The Nexus Between Teaching and Learning\n", "id": "6311", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2949", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This case study takes place in an inner city, urban elementary school that has and continues to undergo various reforms. One of these is reconstitution, a drastic comprehensive school reform approach in which incumbent teachers and administrators in a chronic, low-performing school are replaced with new teachers and administrators in hope of spurring new working conditions and raising student achievement. Another is the 2001 reauthorization of the 1965 federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), more popularly known as the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA). Each act of reform has promised to bring about certain changes that would/will in return improve this particular school. The measure for improvement has and continues to be the results of students' performance on some sort of standardized assessment. The implementation of these high-stakes accountability reforms has directly shaped the context of schooling within this site. \nThis study makes the claim that the core of education exists at the classroom level and is represented by the teaching and learning process, as mediated through relationships between teachers and their students. Teachers, however, hold particular perceptions about the extent to which top-down reforms affect their capacity for innovative teaching within the teaching and learning process. This study explores these perceptions.\nThe results of this study affirm the idea of an educational core and demonstrate that teachers\u2019 capacity for innovative teaching within the core is influenced by broader educational decisions and relationships beyond the classroom level. Such a finding highlights the reality that schools exist within and are responsive to larger socio-political systems such as school districts and local communities (Sarason, 1990, Noguera, 2003; Lipman, 1998). As a result, capacity is made complex, evolving from multiple levels (e.g., national, state, local, and building levels). Because the complexities of capacity directly affect teachers' innovative teaching and in turn their teaching influences students' learning, capacity becomes the nexus between teaching and learning.\nImplications include an examination of the language of student achievement, public deliberations about the current processes of schooling and school reform, and an interdisciplinary research approach toward understanding capacity as the dynamic nexus between teaching and learning.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2942], "author_name_tesi": "Easley II, Jacob ", "last_name_ssi": "Easley II", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Daniel Marshall", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Debra M Freedman", "John W Tippeconnic Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Daniel Marshall, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Debra M Freedman, Committee Member", "John W Tippeconnic Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["comprehensive school reform", "urban school reform", "Capacity", "reconstitution", "teacing and learning innovations"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "PART I.

These materials have attracted considerable attention for their potential application as an active electronic material in logic applications utilizing the Mott type metal-to-insulator transition.\nCaVO3 and SrVO3 correlated metal oxide films have been grown by hybrid-molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), where alkaline earth cations are supplied using a conventional effusion cell and the transition metal vanadium is supplied using the metal-organic precursor vanadium (V) oxytriisopropoxide. Oxygen is available in both molecular and remote plasma activated forms. Titanate-based band insulators, namely SrTiO3 and CaTiO3, have also been grown using titanium tetra-isopropoxide as metal-organic precursor. The grown films have been characterized using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transition electron microscopy (TEM), and electrical properties have been determined using temperature dependent resistivity and Hall measurements. Optimized films exhibit high quality Kiessig fringes, with substrate limited rocking curve widths of 8 arc seconds in the case of CaVO3 and 17 arc seconds in the case of SrVO3. \nBoth vanadate films grew in a step-flow mode with atomic steps visible after growth by AFM. In SrVO3, the perovskite phase remained present with a gradual lattice expansion away from the optimal cation flux ratio. For CaVO3, the films remained phase pure and with little change in lattice parameter throughout a growth window that spanned a 30% range in cation flux ratios. While an abrupt increase of lattice parameter was found for CaVO3 films grown under Ca-rich conditions, films grown under V-rich conditions revealed a gradual reduction in lattice parameter, in contrast to SrVO3 where all defects have been shown to increase unit cell volume. Low resistivity and high residual resistivity ration complex vanadate thin films have been demonstrated. \nMethods for growing minimally strained SrVO3 films on (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 substrates (0.7% tensile) were expanded to other substrates with different lattice mismatches, namely SrTiO3 (1.8% tensile) and LaAlO3 (1.3% compressive). Varying strain modifies bond angles or overlap, and can give rise to an insulating ground state. Changes in the film surface morphology derived from atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to discriminate optimal growth conditions on each substrate. Films grown at each strain state remain strongly metallic at 10 nm thickness. Low temperature resistivity measurements, which demonstrates a marked increase in low temperature resistivity with respect to those films grown at optimized growth parameters, were found to be substrate dependent. The thickness of films grown on SrTiO3 are optimized for maximum thickness without cracking. Use of epitaxial strain as a mechanism for enabling a Mott transition was not demonstrated at strains and conditions attempted within this study. The experimental support of this hypothesis could not be experimentally confirmed within the range of strains studied here.\nFinally, high quality epitaxial SrTiO3-SrVO3-SrTiO3 heterostructures are grown on (LaAlO3)0.3(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 substrates by hybrid MBE. RHEED, XRD, and TEM showed that these structures are of high structural quality, with atomically and chemically abrupt interfaces. By fixing the thickness of the SrTiO3 confinement layers to be 15 nm and decreasing the thickness of the SrVO3 from 50 nm down to 1.2 nm, it has been demonstrated that the system transitions from a strongly-correlated metal to an insulating state, as shown by temperature dependent resistivity and carrier concentration measurements. For films with thickness larger than 1.2 nm, the resistivity versus temperature is described by Fermi liquid behavior. Below this critical thickness the material undergoes an electronic phase transition into a variable-range hopping insulating phase. \nThe results of this dissertation show that high quality vanadate thin films can be grown by hybrid MBE. Their electronic ground state, metallic in the bulk phase, can be effectively changed using geometrical confinement, while epitaxial strain was found to have a negligible effect. The ability to grow CaVO3 in a self-regulated fashion holds promise that the favorable growth kinetics in hybrid MBE might be a general characteristic of the metalorganic precursor employed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11478], "author_name_tesi": "Eaton, Craig Ernest", "last_name_ssi": "Eaton", "middle_name_ssi": "Ernest", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roman Engel Herbert", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Suman Datta", "Venkatraman Gopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roman Engel Herbert, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MBE", "SrVO3", "CaVO3", "epitaxy", "Hybrid"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "DRESSAGE REPRESENTATIONS:  TRANSITIONING FROM IMPERIALISTIC 'HIGH CULTURE' TO MODERN ENTERTAINMENT", "id": "15343mls157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dressage is an elitist equestrian sport that is a remnant of imperial culture.

Increasing the turbine inlet temperature is one way to gain efficiency in an engine, but it results in the need for cooling techniques such as film-cooling.  Film-cooling is a method by which compressor bleed air is injected through the turbine surfaces to form a layer of coolant that protects components from the hot combustion gases. This study investigated the effects of high density ratio film-cooling injection for various film-cooling geometries in the heat transfer and flowfield regimes.  A new facility was developed that combined the use of a heated freestream with cryogenic coolant to achieve high engine-realistic density ratios.  \nAdiabatic effectiveness measurements, which quantify the performance of film-cooling, were conducted and general trends between momentum flux ratio, blowing ratio, density ratio, and velocity ratio were observed.  Results showed that a high density ratio (DR = 1.6) consistently contributed to increased lateral spreading of the film-cooling jets relative to a low density ratio jet (DR = 1.2) at the same blowing ratio.  High momentum flux ratio jets (I > 0.6) were found to contribute to jet detachment.  Particle image velocimetry measurements were made to quantify the time-averaged and instantaneous flowfields. High levels of turbulence intensity were measured to be most prevalent in the jet shear layers and near the hole exit.  At the hole exit, turbulence intensity scaled with momentum flux ratio.  The shear layers, conversely, exhibited the lowest peak turbulence at M = 1 and strengthened as mass flux deviated from that value.  Higher turbulence was generated at high density ratio than low density ratio when the jets were attached contributing to the increased lateral spreading.  The time-resolved data showed shear layer vortices in the form of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.  The vortices had a consistent length scale and broke down into turbulence approximately four cooling diameters downstream from the injection.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8126], "author_name_tesi": "Eberly, Molly Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Eberly", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Molly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Film-Cooling", "High Density Ratio", "Heat Transfer", "Turbomachinery"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigating the role of palmitoylation in the function of the dopamine D2 receptor.", "id": "24760", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11325", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is crucial for regulation of processes such as mood, reward, and motor control.  Abnormalities in D2R expression and/or neurotransmission are associated with a variety of human disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, bipolar disorder, depression, and drug abuse.  Palmitoylation, the thioester attachment of palmitate to cysteine residues, has become a topic of interest for GPCRs as it has been shown to modulate signaling, trafficking, and stability of these receptors.\n\nIn this dissertation, an optimized version of bioorthogonal click chemistry (BCC) was developed with the ultimate goal of studying D2R palmitoylation.  With this technique, proteins are labeled with the chemical probe 15-hexadecynoic acid (15-HDYA) at sites of palmitoylation.  Proteins of interest are then isolated by immunoprecipitation with magnetic beads and analyzed for 15-HDYA incorporation.  The utility of this approach was demonstrated by verifying the palmitoylation of the \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR), a GPCR responsible for mediating the analgesic and addictive properties of most clinically relevant opioid agonist drug.  The MOR has been reported to be palmitoylated using two other palmitoylation assays, but not BCC.  Additionally, our optimized BCC protocol was able to measure changes in palmitoylation upon overexpression of two palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs).  This was the first demonstration that specific PATs are capable of affecting levels of palmitoylated MOR.\n\nWhile previous experiments in insect cells have shown that the D2R is palmitoylated, nothing was known about the site, function, or enzymes responsible. Here, the palmitoylation of the D2R was analyzed using our modified BCC protocol in a mammalian cell system.  Analysis of a series of D2R mutations revealed that palmitoylation of the D2R occurs on the C-terminal cysteine residue (C443) of the polypeptide.  Deletion of C443 led to an almost complete absence of D2R palmitoylation and significantly inhibited trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane.  Rather, the C443 deletion mutant accumulated in the Golgi, indicating that palmitoylation of the D2R is important for cell surface expression of the receptor.  \n\nUsing the full-length D2R as bait in a membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) screen, the palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) zDHHC4 was identified as a D2R interacting protein.  Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that several other PATs, including zDHHC3 (GODZ) and zDHHC8, also interacted with the D2R and that each of the three PATs was capable of affecting the palmitoylation status of the D2R.  Finally, biochemical analysis of the D2R mutants indicates that palmitoylation of the receptor plays a critical role in stability but not the signaling capacity of the D2R.\u00ac \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10863], "author_name_tesi": "Ebersole, Brittany Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Ebersole", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Brittany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Faoud T Ishmael", "Patricia Sue Grigson", "Thomas E Spratt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Faoud T Ishmael, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["palmitoylation", "dopamine D2 receptor", "GPCR", "click chemistry", "immunoprecipitation", "yeast two-hybrid", "palmitoyl acyltransferases"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "\"there is no manual to this mess\": Parent-adolescent communication patterns, privacy management, and talks about substance use", "id": "15702", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7958", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drug experimentation becomes significantly more likely as children reach middle school (Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2010), and the risk of alcohol dependence in adulthood is much higher the younger the alcohol use begins (41% for children who begin drinking at age 12 or younger, approximately 17% for those begin drinking at age 18, and 11% if drinking starts at 21) (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2010). Families can be integral to prevention efforts (Booth-Butterfield & Sidelinger, 1998; Brody, Flor, Hollett-Wright, & McCoy, 1998; Ennett, Bauman, Foshee, Pemberton, & Hicks, 2001; Miller-Day, 2008; Miller-Day & Dodd, 2004; Miller-Day & Kam, 2009), yet we know very little about the effectiveness of communication about substance abuse. Extant research provides evidence that ongoing interactions between parents and children about drugs are a more common strategy than the one-shot \u201cdrug talks\u201d of years past (Miller-Day & Dodd, 2004), and generally, \u201copen communication\u201d between parents and children seems to be a positive factor in family-based prevention processes (Miller-Day, 2008). However, this dissertation fills a gap in the research by providing in-depth descriptions from both parental and adolescent perspectives about the overall family culture that has been established for the first 13 to 17 years of the child\u2019s life, in order to contextualize certain ways of talking about drugs within different families. In addition, this dissertation\u2019s qualitative design contributes ecologically valid data from multiple family members about their subjective experiences of family communication patterns, privacy management, and communication about substance use in general and parental substance use in particular.\nThis dissertation is the result of 85 in-depth, individual interviews with one parent and one of their adolescent children from 40 families in central Pennsylvania and north Florida.\niv\nThere were two primary aims: 1) to examine parent-adolescent discourse and disclosures of expectations about adolescent substance use and 2) to explore the discourse and disclosures of parental substance use. In the process of exploring these two topics of discussion, this dissertation project specifically examined both the family communication patterns and the specific conversational tactics (i.e., topic avoidance) that are situated within broad family cultures and that influence parent-child communication about substance use.\nTwo theoretical perspectives guided this research: family communication patterns (FCP) and communication privacy management (CPM). Patterns of family communication help create a global family culture over time, and those experiences of family culture are best understood in family members\u2019 own words. In addition, the literature on motivations, topics, and consequences of topic avoidance in families was reviewed for further understanding of boundary management processes and a possible explanation for why effective prevention messages may not occur or may not successfully deter adolescent substance use. This qualitative dissertation describes and explains how family communication patterns and boundary management processes affect intergenerational conversations about substance use in general, and communication and perceptions of parental substance use in particular.\nThe findings from the investigation suggest that Pluralistic (high conversation/low conformity orientations) and Consensual (high conversation/high conformity) families, as well as families in which the adolescent perceives a Consensual environment and the parent perceives a Pluralistic one, engage in a lot of open communication generally, within a structure of well-established and mutually understood parental authority. These families did not engage in topic avoidance of substance use per se; however, they demonstrated a spectrum of explicitness of messages about drugs, as well as varying frequencies of talking about prevention of drug use.\nv\nThough none of these families identified a \u201cone-shot drug talk\u201d method of communicating about drugs, some engaged in less frequent and less explicit conversations about drug use than others, and many family members operated with an implicit understanding of what was expected and acceptable when it comes to drug experimentation and use. Family members in the Other category identified different combinations of family communication patterns and demonstrated more emotional disconnection and disparate perceptions of communication about substance use.\nRegarding general family orientations toward privacy, the study involved families who were classified as open (high permeability) within the family system, but they showed variability in the permeability of boundaries with individuals outside their families. Privacy management within families was seen as normative, and parents and adolescents shared similar perceptions of topics that were not completely openly discussed, such as family finances, health matters, extended family conflict, marital issues, and adolescent romantic relationships and friendships. Experimentation with drugs came up for a few adolescents as a secret or topic of avoidance, but that was not the norm. Parental substance use was common (e.g., alcohol consumption and [past] tobacco use), but explicit communication about parental use was not. Parents perceived both more of their own use and more communication about it than their adolescent children did, and children seemed to communicate protective perceptions of their parents\u2019 substance use, even though it was legal and usually moderate.\nThe primary model for \u201cdrug talks\u201d across family communication patterns and family privacy orientations was the ongoing and relatively frequent use of \u201cteachable moments\u201d in the media, the community, children\u2019s schools and distant peer groups, and in participants\u2019 own families. Emergent technologies like smart phones and Facebook were discussed in every interview to some extent, and they seemed to be a prevalent source of prevention communication\nvi\n(i.e., expectations and rules for appropriate use/avoidance of negative consequences of misuse). Technology affected parental monitoring efforts, perceptions of personal and family privacy, and parent-adolescent conflict (often stemming from and resulting in \u201cdigital grounding\u201d). Perhaps most importantly, cyber-bullying and other \u201chorror stories\u201d from computer-mediated communication provided many of the \u201cteachable moments\u201d talked about in the interviews. These findings suggest a need for future research about a third type of necessary prevention talk, in addition to \u201cthe birds and the bees\u201d and \u201cthe drug talk.\u201d These families were either proactively engaging in preventive \u201ctech talks,\u201d or they were learning by trial and error that they needed to address appropriate behavior with technology in reaction to mistakes that were made. The younger the adolescents, the more proactive parents were about having the \u201ctech talk\u201d prior to initiation of cell phone and internet use.\nHealth stories emerged as particularly poignant factors in family communication patterns and subjective experiences of global family culture. As seen with other topics, there was a range of openness between parents and adolescents with health issues, from total openness about persistent conditions with detailed updates to fundamental knowledge of persistent conditions and avoidance of updates, to no knowledge whatsoever of certain tests being done, results, conditions, seriousness, or updates. Health had a significant impact on perceptions of family relational quality and personal well-being and is a factor that deserves future attention when contextualizing certain conversations in a global family culture. Prolonged experiences with cancer or a one-time life-changing injury can each have significant impact on individual family members, family relationships, family communication, decisions, and communication about substance use. Hand-in-hand with health concerns are the prescription medications that often accompany them. Prescription use and misuse commonly came up with both generations in the\nvii\nstudy. This type of drug and drug use is worthy of careful attention in future studies about prevention, family communication patterns, and family culture.\nThe study\u2019s innovative design allowed for the collection of rich, descriptive data and from multiple vantage points within each family. The findings add to the knowledge bases in areas of family communication, privacy management, health communication, qualitative methodology, and prevention science. The importance of the work is grounded in its ability to reveal what details about family life inform family members\u2019 perceptions of family culture, relational quality, and effectiveness of communication generally and about substance use in particular. In addition, these findings advance our knowledge of the role of legal, moderate, parental substance use and the nuanced distinctions between topic avoidance and reliance on implicit understandings that have been established subtly over the life course of a family system. Although this dissertation does not take a best practices position, it does provide a working model of modern prevention communication in families, including relevant factors like technology and health that are intertwined with \u201cteachable moments\u201d that serve as the tangible facilitators for parent-adolescent communication about substance use. The role of technology is apt to be unavoidable in future research endeavors, as is the prevalence of prescription medication use and misuse in families and in parental and adolescent peer groups. Future researchers utilizing the RFCP as a diagnostic instrument should consider the breadth and depth of information that is available by utilizing a mixed-method or qualitative design, which allows for clarification, qualification, and elaboration of participant responses to otherwise limited items of assessment of the complexities of family communication over time.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7910], "author_name_tesi": "Ebersole, Diana Schroeder", "last_name_ssi": "Ebersole", "middle_name_ssi": "Schroeder", "first_name_ssi": "Diana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Michelle E Day", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Alan Booth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle E Day, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Family communication", "Substance abuse prevention", "Qualitative Methods", "Interviews", "Adolescence", "Family Communication Patterns", "Communication Privacy Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Preclassic Maya Social Complexity and Origins of Inequality at Cahal Pech, Belize", "id": "14149cee139", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14149", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the central questions in anthropological archaeology is why social, economic and political inequality developed and what the long-term effects of hierarchical sociopolitical organization were at local and regional levels. The earliest complex societies, characterized by a distinctive set of pan-regional social, political, and economic institutions, first appeared in the southern Maya lowlands during the Preclassic Period (~1200 BC\u2013AD 300). The timing of these cultural changes was variably influenced by internal social dynamics, long-distance economic interaction, increasing reliance on agriculture, and climate change.\n\nThis dissertation examines the emergence of socio-economic inequality at the site of Cahal Pech (Belize), one of the first permanently inhabited settlements in the southern Maya lowlands, based on archaeological survey and excavation, high-resolution AMS 14C dating, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses on human and faunal remains, and trace element characterization of obsidian and ceramic artifacts. A high-resolution Bayesian radiocarbon chronology was developed to understand the timing and tempo of building phases within the Cahal Pech civic-ceremonial site core and peripheral residential settlements. These results are compared to the largest compiled database of published radiocarbon dates from Preclassic cultural contexts at sites in five major regions of the southern lowlands to interpret the expansion and decline of complex social groups. Comparisons to paleoclimate proxy datasets suggest that fluctuating climate regimes promoted alternating phases of integration and fragmentation of early hierarchally organized societies. Stable climatic conditions during the Middle Preclassic Period (900-300 cal BC) fostered the centralization of populations and the formation of large regional polities across the southern lowlands. An extended drought at the end of the Late Preclassic (AD 150-300) likely contributed to the decline of some major polities in the central Pet\u00e9n region of Guatemala, but smaller sites such as Cahal Pech in the Belize Valley were more resilient and persisted in to the Classic Period. AMS radiocarbon dating and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of human skeletal remains from this critical time period at Cahal Pech suggest a more diverse diet incorporating wild and domestic foods promoted resilience in the face of social reorganization and changing ecological systems at the end of the Preclassic Period. During the Late and Terminal Classic periods (AD 300-900), elites buried in the site center had developed a hyper-specialized and narrow maize-based diet. In contrast, commoner households consumed an increasingly broad diet as a fallback as elite demands for maize increased and periods of acute drought became more prevalent in the Terminal Classic.\n\nTo understand the role of households in the development of socioeconomic inequality, the production, distribution, and consumption of resources between households and the Cahal Pech civic-ceremonial epicenter was also examined through trace element characterization of obsidian and ceramic artifacts. Technological and portable X-ray \ufb02uorescence (pXRF) analyses of obsidian indicates that the site core and households consumed imported obsidian blades from southern Guatemala beginning in the Early Preclassic, a pattern which persisted throughout the site\u2019s occupation. Four primary compositional groups of Preclassic period ceramics are visible in instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) data and indicate differential consumption of pottery between commoner households and the elite site epicenter. Comparisons between obsidian and ceramic networks suggest that households at Cahal Pech provisioned themselves through overlapping and contrasting procurement strategies that included long-distance exchange with other high-status groups, as well as independent domestic procurement. Stratified institutional economies may have developed out of inter-regional exchange networks. As a diachronic study in social change, this project also contributes to our understanding of modern and prehistoric cultural development in response to changing social, economic, and climatic conditions. \u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14815], "author_name_tesi": "Ebert, Claire E", "last_name_ssi": "Ebert", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas James Kennett", "Douglas James Kennett", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Sarah Barbara Mcclure", "Timothy Michael Murtha Jr.", "Jaime Jose Awe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas James Kennett, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas James Kennett, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member", "Sarah Barbara Mcclure, Committee Member", "Timothy Michael Murtha Jr., Outside Member", "Jaime Jose Awe, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Formative Mesoamerica", "Ancient Maya", "Social Complexity", "Trade and Exchange", "Household Archaeology", "Radiocarbon Dating", "Human-Environment Interactions", "Stable Isotope Geochemistry", "Dietary Reconstruction", "Geochemical Souring"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF SURFACE CONDITIONS ON POOL-BOILING HEAT TRANSFER FOR VARIOUS MATERIALS", "id": "15077sae184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15077", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this research, minimum film boiling temperature (Tmin) is quantitatively determined as a function of the initial substrate temperature, liquid subcooling, surface thermophysical properties and surface conditions. Since Tmin defines the boundary between the film and transition boiling regimes, its value is significant for the design of an emergency core cooling system following a hypothetical loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) in a nuclear power plant. When a sufficiently heated surface is plunged in a water pool, a vapor blanket is generated around the test section acting as a heat transfer insulator due to the poor thermal conductivity of the vapor. At temperatures lower than Tmin, the heat transfer is dramatically enhanced owing the collapse of the vapor film allowing direct physical contact between the water and the heated surface. Therefore, it is very important to explore methods and techniques that increase this temperature in order to improve the safety of nuclear reactors. \nA test facility was designed and constructed to conduct quenching experiments using vertical rods. Seven cylindrical test samples were fabricated with embedded thermocouples inside the cladding material. The thermocouples were connected to a data acquisition system in order to measure the temperature history during the experiments. The temperature and heat flux at the surface were calculated using an inverse heat conduction code along with an advance image processing technique to quantitatively characterize the liquid-vapor interfacial waves, vapor layer thickness, Tmin, quenching temperature, quenching time, and quench front velocity in the film boiling heat transfer regime. Visualization of the boiling behavior was captured by a high-speed camera at a frame rate of 750 frames per second (fps). The thermocouple data and the captured videos were synchronized to couple the behavior of the vapor layer with the thermal behavior of the heated sample. Various characterization techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) associated with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and field emission scanning electron were employed to identify the phases, chemical composition, and surface microstructure of the Inconel-600 before and after being used in a 7 x 7 rod bundle facility. Micro- and nanoparticles composed of nickel, chromium, and iron oxides were observed at the surface of the oxidized Inconel samples.  It was found that the porous microstructure coupled with the increase in liquid spreading played a significant role in the enhancement of the film boiling heat transfer. \nFinally, the heat transfer behavior in the film boiling regime was investigated by calculating the heat transfer coefficient and Nusselt number for various cases. The novelty of this research is the coupling between the results of the quenching experiments and the surface characterization analyses that prompted the development of a new correlation for Tmin. This correlation adequately captures the effects of liquid subcooling, porosity of the oxide layer, and system pressure.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16380], "author_name_tesi": "Ebrahim, Shikha A", "last_name_ssi": "Ebrahim", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Shikha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan-Bill Cheung", "Anil Kulkarni", "Albert Segall", "Stephen Lynch", "Stephen M.

The present study examined the assets and liabilities associated with diverse versus homogenous organization of friendships across groups, thus extending past efforts to understand friendship adjustment solely in qualitative or quantitative terms. Drawing partially on theories formed within organizational psychology, we predicted that individuals who prefer to be \u201csocial butterflies\u201d with involvement in many non-overlapping friendships would enjoy added protection from social (but not necessarily emotional) loneliness and display greater interpersonal competence. We examined but did not necessarily expect that their individual friendships would suffer from lower quality, perhaps as result of the lack of group support for these relationships.\n\nParticipants included 118 early adolescents from 11 to 12 years of age completed a battery of questionnaires including well-known and validated measures of friendship quality, social and emotional loneliness, and interpersonal competence. They also completed an original 6-item questionnaire that tapped their experience and preference for friendships organized across multiple friendship groups. All assessments, including the newly created Social Butterfly self-report, were internally consistent and reliable.\n\nRegression analyses indicated, as expected, that individuals who preferred and experienced friendship with individuals across many groups enjoyed lower levels of social and emotional loneliness and possessed greater levels of some types of social skills, especially skills for initiating relationships and managing conflict. Girls, but not boys, with diffuse friendship involvement had more friends overall, but importantly, all relationships held after controlling for number of friends, indicating that it was the organization and not the extent of friendship involvement that mattered.

Through the lens of teacher efficacy, the research presented herein was built around two groups of guiding questions: 1) Do novice teachers in at-risk urban schools feel adequately prepared to effectively perform the task of teaching? Does this impact retention and commitment to teaching? 2) If teachers in at-risk urban schools feel less prepared than others do, why do they feel this way and how do they explain how it impact their teaching? These questions were addressed using a two-phase explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. The first, quantitative, phase involved the analysis of nationally representative data from the 2007-2008 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), 2007-2008 Common Core of Data (CCD) and the 2008-2009 Teacher Follow-Up Survey (TFS) (All NCES data sets). The second, qualitative, phase consisted of interviews with novice teachers working in urban schools. Analysis reveals that, when compared with novice teachers in other school, novice teachers in urban schools are less prepared for teaching (based on measurable qualifications). What is more, when compared with teachers holding similar qualifications, novice teachers in urban schools also feel less prepared (as measured by teacher efficacy). \nNovice teachers who feel underprepared for teaching, furthermore, tend to have significantly lower levels of commitment to teaching and first-year teachers who feel underprepared are significantly more likely to leave teaching or switch schools. Teachers explain that feeling underprepared is most likely the result of a collection of urban-specific stressors that they were not exposed or prepared for to during teacher training. This study finds support for teacher-training programs focused on increased exposure to urban students and schools, direct guidance regarding several of the urban-specific stressors and an explicit philosophy of education. These findings, by uncovering the knowledge and experiences that novice urban teachers often lack during the first year, also support the need for high quality, district-specific induction programs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5466], "author_name_tesi": "Eckert, Sarah Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Eckert", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "David Alexander Gamson", "Katerina Bodovski", "Stephanie L Knight"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra, Dissertation Advisor", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Chair", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Stephanie L Knight, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Teacher Efficacy", "Urban Schools", "Teacher Preparpation", "Teacher Retention"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, SYNTHESIS, ANTIVIRAL EVALUATION AND \nMETABOLISM OF \nNUCLEOSIDE ANALOGS\n\n\n\n", "id": "8882", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "RNA viruses cause a plethora of diseases which are difficult to treat due to the high mutation rate of such pathogens. Current therapies for RNA virus infections are severely limited due to the development of antiviral drug resistance. Such viruses exist in nature as a quasispecies resulting from the high error frequency of replication. RNA viruses as thus highly adaptable and also exist on the edge of \u201cerror catastrophe.\u201d Thus small increases in the mutation rate can cause a drastic decrease in viral viability. Based on this concept, a new approach to the design of antiviral agents termed \u201clethal mutagenesis\u201d has emerged whereby drugs that increase the error rate of RNA viruses may be developed to combat viral diseases. \nChapter one provides an overall review of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy. Ribavirin, a clinically utilized nucleoside antiviral agent, has shown to be a lethal mutagen. Once transported across cellular membranes and phosphorylated to the 5&#900; triphosphate, the base-modified nucleoside triphosphate is a degenerate substrate for the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).   In the viral genome, misincorporation is templated by the ribavirin pseudo base resulting in an increase in overall frequency of mutations and error catastrophe and decreased infectivity of the virus.\nThe work described herein explores the efforts to design and synthesize effective antiviral nucleosides and probe their mechanism of action as lethal mutagens. Chapter two describes the investigation of isocarbostyril nucleosides as antiviral agents. Three isocarbostyril ribonucleoside analogs, ICS-R, MICS-R, and SICS-R, were synthesized by the Vorbr\u00fcggen procedure and evaluated as antivirals.  ICS-R was discovered to be the most potent analog followed by SICS-R and MICS-R demonstrating antiviral activity greater than clinical agent Ribavirin against poliovirus. Additionally, 5&#900; and 2&#900; modified ICS-R control compounds demonstrated no antiviral effect. The corresponding ICS-R analog triphosphates displayed slow kinetics of incorporation and revealed inhibition of PV viral RdRP as the mode of action. ICS-R(TP) accumulated intracellularly to a greater degree than MICS-R and SICS-R corroborating antiviral and biochemical results. \nChapter three is divided into two sections exploring the mechanism of action of 5-nitroindole nucleoside and the development of 5-halo indole nucleosides. The mechanism of antiviral activity of 5-nitroindole ribonucleoside  was investigated though the evaluation of a series of mechanistic probes and biochemical characterization of phosphorylated 5-nitroindole analogs. 5NINDN(DP) and 5NINDN(MP) were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of PV viral polymerase in comparison with 5NINDN(TP) and the parent nucleoside 5NINDN. Surprisingly, both triphosphate and diphosphate inhibited the viral polymerase, however reversed-phase HPLC analyses revealed detectable phosphorylation limited only to 5NINDN(MP). Further evaluation of mechanistic probes 5&#900;OMe5NINDN, 5-nitroindole, and N-Eth-OH 5-nitroindole indicated that intracellular phosphorylation was not necessary for antiviral activity and revealed inhibition of cellular translation was proposed as a mediator of antiviral activity. Due to instability of the nitroaromatic nucleobase, stable 5-halo analogs 5ClINDN  and 5-BrINDN were synthesized and evaluated as agents more active than the parent 5NINDN.    \n\tChapter four focuses on the application of ribosylation agents with modified protecting groups to optimize access to indole nucleosides. By altering the electronic substituents on ribose protecting groups, a series of ribosylation agents were designed to improve access to biologically active indole nucleosides. Additionally, there was a decrease in an undesired orthoamide byproduct and an increase in the overall yield of the nucleoside\n\tChapter five demonstrates the detection of phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs as determinants of antiviral activity.  Reversed phase HPLC methods to detect phosphorylation of nucleosides were optimized and applied to evaluation of hydrogen-bonding lethal mutagens. The lack of antiviral activity for nucleoside P is attributed to undetectable conversion to the 5&#900; triphosphate. Additionally, purine analog JA28, is a lethal mutagen which is efficiently phosphorylated to JA28 (TP). Structural comparisons between phosphorylated and non- phosphorylated nucleosides  reveal  insights into the future design of lethal mutagens. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2920], "author_name_tesi": "Edathil, Jocelyn P", "last_name_ssi": "Edathil", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Jocelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Blake R Peterson", "Gong Chen", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Anthony Edward Pegg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Blake R Peterson, Committee Chair", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nucleotides", "universal base", "poliovirus", "lethal mutagenesis", "nucleoside synthesis", "RNA virus", "nucleosides", "RNA-dependent RNA polymerase", "carbohydrate synthesis", "nucleoside phosphorylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Location Extraction from Text Features in Practical Environments", "id": "15168jte5085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15168", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis explores the potential of harnessing text extraction within a constrained environment aimed at guiding and augmenting a visually impaired end-user\u2019s shopping experience.

The information processes thought to be engaged by a particular method for inducing motor output were then related to performance.   \nEvidence is presented that is consistent with the hypothesis that the source of the 1:2 and 2:1 interval-ratio advantages in unimanual tapping is internal representations based on real-time sensory events associated with target performance. This is accomplished by demonstrating that the 1:2 and 2:1 advantages were observed in tasks that did not provide participants with knowledge of results or KR (i.e., imitation tasks and continuation task) and eliminated in tasks that provided participants with KR about time intervals (i.e., shaping tasks). Previous research in motor learning has suggested that participants base their internal representations on real-time sensory information when they are not provided with KR and that participants do not base their internal representations on real-time sensory information when they are provided with KR. On the other hand, the 1:1 interval-ratio advantage was observed in the current study when participants were provided with KR and also when they were not provided with KR. This finding indicates that the 1:1 advantage may have more than one contributing factor. \nIn addition, the current study demonstrates that the influence that required time-interval-ratios had on performance in the shaping and imitation tasks was largely independent of other properties of the sets of time intervals that were tested. This is accomplished by showing that the relations between performance and required time-interval-ratios were similar in two experiments that tested the same time-interval-ratios while using different sets of time interval pairs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2956], "author_name_tesi": "Eder, Jeffrey Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Eder", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A.

Engineers often seek to predict the performance of a prototype by building and testing a scale model.  Model theory has traditionally worked well for predicting hydrodynamic loads, but predictions of cavitation inception from scale model tests have proved to be quite unreliable.  The current theory of cavitation scaling assumes that the dimensionless cavitation number will remain constant between the model and the prototype.  Experiments, however, often show that incipient cavitation numbers change significantly with length scale and the properties of the water supply.  The problem is further complicated by experimental data which shows that the prototype cavitation number will sometimes increase from the model values, but at other times will decrease.  Changes in the cavitation number between the model and the prototype are known as cavitation scale effects.  Cavitation inception in circular jets has been the subject of recent experimental studies.  These studies have found that jet flows experience significant cavitation scale effects.  The data indicates that cavitation number unexpectedly increases with jet diameter.\n\nThis thesis explores the scale effects associated with cavitation inception and looks to explain the scale effects observed in jet flows.  The goal of the thesis is to develop tools which can be used to predict prototype cavitation inception.  As a first step, a dimensional analysis of the cavitating jet was completed.  This dimensional analysis showed that the cavitation number is a function of at least eight dimensionless parameters.  An analysis of these parameters shows that it is not possible to keep all of these parameters constant between the model and prototype.  This means that the relative importance of the governing parameters will change with the length scale of the flow.\n\nIn order to investigate the scale effects further, a numerical code is developed to simulate the response of cavitation nuclei to a fidelity detached-eddy simulation of a circular jet.  The radial growth of cavitation nuclei is governed by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and the dispersion of the bubbles is governed by a\nsemi-empirical equation of motion.  This is the first time that an unsteady computational fluid dynamics simulation has been used in combination with the Rayleigh-Plesset equation to simulate cavitation inception.  Results of the numerical simulations are consistent with previous experimental data.  The scale effects observed in the historical data are confirmed to exist.  The results also indicate that the initial nuclei size is the critical parameter for determining whether the incipient cavitation number will increase or decrease with changes in length scale\n\nCavitation scale effects are also investigated from a theoretical perspective.  The nonlinear response of nuclei bubbles to an oscillating pressure is investigated.  This investigation leads to the development of a scaling law derived from the equilibrium Rayleigh-Plesset equation.  The scaling law provides a method to predict the incipient cavitation number for a prototype flow by using the data obtained from a scale model.  Unlike prior\nempirical relations and the current cavitation inception theory, the equilibrium scaling relation can predict and explain opposing trends in historical data.   The equilibrium scaling law is validated by comparing with the numerical simulations of the jet flow and by comparing with historical hydrofoil data.  These validations show that the equilibrium theory can predict prototype cavitation inception from scale model test data.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [609], "author_name_tesi": "Edge, Brian A.", "last_name_ssi": "Edge", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric G Paterson", "Ali Borhan", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Laura Pauley", "Mario F Trujillo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric G Paterson, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Laura Pauley, Committee Member", "Mario F Trujillo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cavitation Inception", "Detached-eddy simulation", "circular jet", "round jet", "cavitation scale effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "GROWTH OF AMORPHOUS AND EPITAXIAL ALTERNATIVE GATE DIELECTRICS ON SILICON BY MOLECULAR-BEAM EPITAXY AND THEIR CHARACTERIZATION", "id": "6941", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3844", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The continued scaling of SiO2 in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) is approaching its fundamental limit and in the next few years will have to be replaced with an alternative gate dielectric if Moore\u2019s law is to continue.   In a search for suitable alternative dielectrics, I have investigated the growth of amorphous and epitaxial LaAlO3, LaScO3, La2O3, and Sc2O3 thin films by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on silicon.  A major challenge in the growth of alternative gate dielectrics on silicon is the formation of SiO2 at the interface between silicon and the high-K gate dielectric.  In this dissertation, I have established deposition conditions that yielded abrupt interfaces (< 0.1 \u00c5 of SiO2) between amorphous LaAlO3 or LaScO3 thin films and silicon.  These results demonstrate the thinnest gate dielectrics ever produced that are free of interfacial SiO2, despite exposure to air.  The thermal stability between silicon and the abrupt amorphous LaAlO3 and LaScO3 thin films was established for the first time.  By 900 \u00b0C, crystallization is clearly observed, but the LaAlO3/Si interface remains sharp with no detectable interfacial SiO2.  The thermal stability results establish key processing windows for the integration of amorphous LaAlO3 and LaScO3 thin films into silicon-based MOSFETs.

Men who were abusive toward their partners and learned to change have found a new perspective that allows them to cease their abusive behaviors.  This study identified the incidents, along with the feelings and emotions surrounding them, which provided the catalyst for this ideological change.  \nIn-depth interviews of ten formerly abusive men who identified themselves as having changed their perspectives about abuse toward their partners were conducted. The purpose was to uncover the causes for their change as they described them, and to show how the constructs of transformative learning theories support this change.  The study employed interpretive analysis and an open inductive research approach that sought to develop themes, patterns and categories of meaning that clarified the personal reflections of the subjects.  \nA distinct aspect of the study is that it focuses on men\u2019s self-reported perceptions of the critical incidents that initiated their individual change.  In doing so, it has produced a rich and personal account of the inner lives of the participants and it extends previous research beyond the realm of psychosocial theories of explanation for behavior. It also applies transformative learning theories to the process of change.  \nThe findings indicate the significance of history as a context for understanding the abuser and the importance of attending to experiences as a tool for use within abuse intervention programs. Most compellingly is the clear indication of the need for abusive men to develop a therapeutic relationship with another person who can assist them in confronting their responsibility for their abuse and provide support and direction throughout the change process. \nAdditionally, the study contributes to the field of adult education by demonstrating the importance of the individual\u2019s experiences to the process of transformative learning. The information found through this study should prove helpful in providing insight to those charged with program development of abuse intervention programs.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4016], "author_name_tesi": "Edmiston, Marian D'Angelo", "last_name_ssi": "Edmiston", "middle_name_ssi": "D'Angelo", "first_name_ssi": "Marian", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "M A Toni Dupont Dupont Morales", "Kenneth M Kyle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Member", "M A Toni Dupont Dupont Morales, Committee Member", "Kenneth M Kyle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["men", "domestic violence", "domestic abuse", "transformative learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF RIVER-DOMINATED DELTAS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTARY NETWORKS\n", "id": "9379", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1310", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "River-dominated deltas are dynamic environments and because they are home to a significant fraction of the world\u2019s population we need to understand their growth and evolution so their behavior can be predicted and hazards can be mitigated.  Here, using a combination of numerical modeling, physical experiments, and field data, I investigate the processes that participate in the growth and evolution of river-dominated delta channel networks.  Using physical experiments I document that deltaic avulsions are caused by an upstream migrating wave of sedimentation that is triggered by a stagnated river mouth bar.  An avulsion occurs at the levee location where the greatest average shear stress has been exerted for the longest time.  The subsequent evolution of the delta network is a function of the configuration and stability of the individual bifurcations that divide water and sediment.  Numerical modeling experiments show that the discharge ratio in the downstream bifurcate channels is a function of the Shields number in the upstream channel.  There are two equilibrium functions where one defines symmetrical configurations (equal partitioning of discharge), while the other two define asymmetrical configurations (unequal partitioning of discharge).  A network of equilibrium bifurcations is stable to perturbations.  Using numerical experiments and field data I show that delta networks are generally stable to perturbations in the form of a closure of a bifurcate channel.  Interestingly though, the effect of that perturbation redistributes the water and sediment fluxes throughout the delta, which has the potential to change the long term evolution of a delta.  Most notably, these results have implications for engineering fluvial systems.  For example, in the 1960s it was thought that all the water from the Mississippi River would flow down the Atchafalaya River.  To stabilize this bifurcation a control structure was built to regulate the discharge distribution.  The results in this thesis suggest that perhaps a stable bifurcation could have been designed without the aide of control structures.

In 2010, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) issued more stringent total dissolved solids (TDS) regulations effectively prohibiting the discharge of wastewater into Pennsylvania\u2019s surface waters. Then in April 2011, the PA DEP requested that drilling operators cease sending wastewater to municipal sewage treatment plants. These policies have increased the use of underground injection, particularly in Ohio, and recycling and reuse as wastewater disposal methods. \n     This thesis seeks to determine the factors that a drilling company considers in its choice of wastewater disposal method, through the use of a mixed logit model. In particular, the model includes price, distance, size, competition, distance to \u201cnearest\u201d large city, and river basin dummy variables. The model is then estimated using Stata 12 and the coefficient estimates obtained are then used to calculate the marginal effects of the variables on the probabilities that a brine or industrial waste treatment plant, an injection well, or recycling and reuse will be the disposal method chosen. \n     The results show that the marginal effects of the price and distance variables both have the expected negative signs, meaning that an increase in either of them will result in a decrease in the probability that the corresponding disposal method will be chosen. This represents rational economic behavior. Overall the price of the disposal method and, more importantly, the cost of transporting the wastewater from the gas production well to the disposal location (for which the distance variable is a proxy), have the largest impacts on the probability that a particular alternative will be chosen. This indicates that policies that affect the price or location of disposal methods will be the most effective in influencing the use of a particular method.\n     The marginal effect of the size variable has a positive sign which can be explained through economies of scale. The competition variable also has a positive sign. An increase in competition would place a strain on the supply of freshwater withdrawals available for the fracing process which would then create a market for the treated water that is produced by the recycling facilities. Therefore the use of recycling and reuse facilities to treat wastewater would be encouraged. \n     The marginal effect of the \u201cdistance to nearest large city\u201d variable has a negative sign which can be explained by access to valuable infrastructure, such as roads and pipelines, which is the result of being located close to a city. The marginal effects of the river basin dummy variables were not as intuitive and would benefit from a recalculation using a counterfactual simulation (as discussed in Section 4.4) instead of the method actually used.\n     The results of the model estimation are then used to calculate the marginal effects of the explanatory variables on the probabilities that the three disposal methods (brine or industrial waste treatment plant, injection well, and recycling and reuse) will be chosen by the drilling operators. Their interpretations can then be used to predict what the future of wastewater disposal will look like under three possible future scenarios (a business-as-usual scenario, a permanent moratorium in Youngstown, Ohio, and a scenario in which Pennsylvania takes primacy of its underground injection program). \n     The interpretations of the marginal effects of the variables, as well as the conclusions gleaned from the three presented scenarios, can then be considered by policymakers and utilized to influence future policies in the state of Pennsylvania.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7845], "author_name_tesi": "Edmundson, Caitlyn Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Edmundson", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlyn", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles William Abdalla"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles William Abdalla, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus Shale", "natural gas drilling", "wastewater", "underground injection", "recycling and reuse", "brine treatment plant", "logit"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Atmospheric Circulations of Terrestrial Planets Orbiting Low Mass Stars\n\n\n", "id": "8129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "350", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Atmospheres of planets orbiting low mass stars have properties unlike those typically studied by climatologists.  One of the most glaring differences is that the rotation is \u201ctrapped\u201d for planets orbiting within the habitable zone of the star.  This lack of a typical \u201cday\u201d changes these planets\u2019 dynamics.  Previous work includes that of Gareth Williams and Manoj Joshi.  Joshi discussed planets with 10-day orbits only.  Williams focused on planets with differing rotation rates, but still rotating relative to their star.  Here, tidally locked planets with a variety of orbital periods ranging from 1 to 100 days are discussed.  The GENESIS model is used to simulate these planets, and the data are analyzed for waves, energy fluxes, and habitability.    The major components of the energy fluxes are the mean meridional circulation (i.e., the Hadley cell) and stationary eddies in the form of a wave number 1 stationary Rossby wave.  A transition point in the atmospheric circulation is identified for orbital periods between 100 hours and 101 hours for dry planets.  For the wet planets, the transition occurs near 96-hour rotation period.  This transition occurs when the Rossby radius of deformation approaches the planet\u2019s radius and is associated with the increasing importance of the wave number two stationary eddy as the Rossby radius approaches the planetary radius.    \nThe most habitable dry planet is found to be the 2400-hour orbiter.  For the wet planets, the 24-hour rotator is most habitable.  The most habitable wet planet is the 24-hour rotator, with the least habitable wet planet being the 2400-hour rotator.  The difference in the rotation period of the most habitable planets between the dry planets and the wet planets is caused by the availability of water vapor as a greenhouse gas, the added heat transport through sea ice movement, and the larger heat capacity for the wet planets.   When realistic planets are modeled, the habitable surface area and average surface temperature is dependent on the landmass distribution.  Large landmasses illuminated by the star draw down the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, which decreases the habitable area.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [345], "author_name_tesi": "Edson, Adam Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Edson", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Kasting", "Sukyoung Lee", "Peter R Bannon", "David Pollard", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Diane Marie Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Kasting, Committee Chair", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Chair", "Peter R Bannon, Committee Member", "David Pollard, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["climate", "planetary atmospheres", "astrobiology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "\nSTUDIES IN TOBACCO HARM REDUCTION: THE ROLE OF CONTEXT IN SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO A REDUCED EXPOSURE TOBACCO PRODUCT \n", "id": "8043", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "621", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cigarette smoking remains one of the most important and preventable causes of morbidity and mortality.  Tobacco harm reduction has been recognized as one component of a comprehensive tobacco control effort. Potential reduced exposure tobacco products (PREPs), particularly low-nitrosamine smokeless tobacco products, have attracted attention as promising harm reduction products.  However, there is little research to date to support a viable role for these products within tobacco harm reduction efforts. \n\nThe current study included two trials of smokers\u2019 evaluations and use of a low nitrosamine smokeless tobacco product.  Both trials employed a between-subjects design and all participants were screened to ensure eligibility.  In the first trial, participants were randomly assigned to evaluate information emphasizing harm reduction (n=20) or convenience factors (n=20) and to evaluate the tobacco product. In the second trial, all participants evaluated the product during 3 lab sessions.  Participants were randomly assigned to an experimental (n=21) or control (n=19) condition at the end of the 1st session.  Participants in the experimental group tried the tobacco product daily for 5 days until the 2nd lab session; those in the control group had no additional use of the tobacco until the 2nd lab session. Between lab sessions 2 and 3, all participants were free to use the tobacco product if they chose, but use was not required. Participants recorded all their tobacco use between lab sessions.   \n\nFindings from trial one revealed no statistically significant differences in evaluations of information emphasizing harm reduction potential versus convenience factors of a non-smoked tobacco.  Further, results from the 2nd trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall evaluations of the product by itself and compared to cigarettes regardless of experimental condition.  However, participants in the control condition demonstrated a small but significant decrease in smoking when they were free to use the trial tobacco outside the lab.  The majority of participants stated they would try the tobacco product again, primarily when smoking was not permitted and to cut down on smoking.

Multiwavelength sensing approaches, such as differential absorption lidar (DIAL) and differential absorption and scattering (DAS), are used for single (or a few) species detection boasting high sensitivity and long path detection capability.  Broadband techniques, such as differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), are capable of detecting several species simultaneously over shorter path lengths and employ inversion algorithms to determine individual concentrations of the detected species.  \nThis thesis presents an extension of earlier research using supercontinuum absorption spectroscopy (SAS) to measure atmospheric species.  SAS is a broadband differential absorption approach that combines several of the best aspects of traditional multiwavelength, broadband, and hyperspectral techniques for atmospheric sensing.  The key component of the SAS approach is a supercontinuum laser, which provides broadband capability while maintaining the qualities of a typical discrete wavelength laser source.   This work presents measurements of atmospheric species acquired from a modified transceiver configured to operate on paths of 1 km range.   Near-infrared spectra obtained using a high-resolution CCD grating spectrometer as a SAS detector compare well with MODTRANTM simulations, and measurements of oxygen and water vapor absorption are used to demonstrate the capability and illustrate the potential for the SAS technique.  A previously developed multiwavelength inversion algorithm is applied to the measurements to accurately determine the concentrations of oxygen and water vapor while in the presence of other interfering species.  The results presented validate the usefulness of SAS over long paths, and serve as a demonstration of SAS for near-infrared sensing of atmospheric trace species.  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4928], "author_name_tesi": "Edwards, Perry S.", "last_name_ssi": "Edwards", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Perry", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick", "C Russell Philbrick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick, Thesis Advisor", "C Russell Philbrick, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["supercontinuum", "DOAS", "DIAL", "atmospheric sensing", "lidar", "remote sensing", "spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Novel Raman Techniques for Imaging and Sensing", "id": "19096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9050", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Raman scattering spectroscopy is extensively demonstrated as a label-free, chemically selective sensing and imaging technique for a multitude of chemical and biological applications. The ability to detect \"fingerprint\" spectral signatures of individual molecules, without the need to introduce chemical labelers, makes Raman scattering a powerful sensing technique. However, spectroscopy based on spontaneous Raman scattering traditionally suffers from inherently weak signals due to small Raman scattering cross-sections. Thus, considerable efforts have been put forth to find pathways towards enhancing Raman signals to bolster sensitivity for detecting small concentrations of molecules or particles. The development of coherent Raman techniques that can offer orders of magnitude increase in signal have garnered significant interest in recent years for their application in imaging; such techniques include coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and stimulated Raman scattering. Additionally, methods to enhance the local field of either the pump or generated Raman signal, such as through surface enhanced Raman scattering, have been investigated for their orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and single molecule sensing capability.\n\tThe work presented in this dissertation describes novel techniques for performing high speed and highly sensitive Raman imaging as well as sensing applications towards bioimaging and biosensing. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is combined with holography to enable recording of high-speed (single laser shot), wide field CARS holograms which can be used to reconstruct the both the amplitude and the phase of the anti-Stokes field therefore allowing 3D imaging. This dissertation explores CARS holography as a viable label-free bio-imaging technique.\n\tA Raman scattering particle sensing system is also developed that utilizes wave guide properties of optical fibers and ring-resonators to perform enhanced particle sensing. Resonator-enhanced particle sensing is experimentally examined as a new method for enhancing Raman scattering from particles interacting with circulating optical fields within both a fiber ring-cavity and whispering gallery mode microtoroid microresonators. \n\tThe achievements described in this dissertation include: (1) Demonstration of the bio-imaging capability of CARS holography by recording of CARS holograms of subcellular components in live cancer (HeLa) cells.

In this work, I hypothesized that previous experimental challenges in measuring reduction potentials of Fe redox couples, and particularly interfacial Fe redox couples that involve aqueous Fe2+ and solid-phase Fe3+, could be overcome using mediated potentiometry. Mediated potentiometry uses soluble electron shuttles to facilitate redox equilibration between suspended iron minerals in solution and a measuring redox electrode operating in open circuit potential mode. To test this hypothesis, I first performed a set of validation experiments in which I measured reduction potentials (E) as a function of mediator type and mediator concentration. I then measured reduction potential values for interfacial redox couples of three commonly occurring Fe oxides (goethite, hematite, and magnetite) in equilibrium with aqueous Fe2+ as a function of pH and aqueous Fe2+ concentration. Using these measurements, I calculated standard reduction potentials (E0). The measured values for goethite and hematite were in excellent agreement with those calculated from Gibbs free energy values for the expected redox reactions. Quantifying these reduction potentials is an important step towards understanding the precise nature of redox reactions involving Fe in the environment.

Efficiency for converting feed to milk was greater (level effect: P&#8804;0.05) for 50% vs. 35% inclusion rate (1.76 vs. 1.67, respectively)). Yields or percentages of milk fat, protein, and lactose were not significantly different across diets. Rumen pH and ammonia concentration were similar across treatments. No differences in VFA profiles were observed except that concentrations of isobutyrate and isovalerate were higher (corn silage type effect: P&#8804;0.05) for cows fed CONV vs. BMR corn silage. Feeding BMR corn silage at 50% of ration DM did not affect DMI and maintained milk yield compared with CONV corn silage. Efficiency of converting feed to milk however was affected more by the level of corn silage inclusion in the ration than type of corn silage.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6148], "author_name_tesi": "Edwards, Travis D.", "last_name_ssi": "Edwards", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga", "Gabriella Anne Varga", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Chad Daniel Dechow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gabriella Anne Varga, Thesis Advisor", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Thesis Advisor", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Thesis Advisor", "Chad Daniel Dechow, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["BMR", "corn silage", "milk yield"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Development of Attachment to the Therapist: A Mixed-methods Case Study", "id": "22499", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10254", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Attachment to the therapist is a relatively new area of psychotherapy research. While research has shown that clients can and do form attachments to their therapists (e.g., Mallinckrodt, Gantt, & Coble, 1995) it is unclear how and to what end these attachments develop. \nThis study utilized a longitudinal mixed-methods case study design to examine how attachment to the therapist developed in brief (six-session) psychotherapy for a client with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Phobia. Multiple perspectives (client, therapist, observer) were considered. Associations between attachment to the therapist and client depressive and social anxiety symptoms were also explored. Task analysis was utilized to generate a model of the development of secure attachment to the therapist. Two phases of attachment development were identified in the rational-empirical model, including \u201cpre-attachment\u201d and \u201cattachment-in-the-making.\u201d Key behavioral, cognitive, and emotional tasks were identified for each phase. Quantitative findings showed a direct relationship between both secure and preoccupied-merger attachment to the therapist and depressive symptoms. An inverse relationship between both secure and preoccupied-merger attachment to the therapist and social anxiety symptoms was also found. Finally, fearful-avoidant attachment to the therapist was inversely related to depressive symptoms and not related to social anxiety symptoms. Qualitative and quantitative results indicated that secure attachment to the therapist developed rapidly in this case. Data suggested that the development of this attachment was aided by the therapist consistently serving as a safe haven and secure base for the client, and the client using the therapist as a safe haven and secure base.

Herbicides and herbicide drift are often indicated as primary factors in these declines, but because herbicide use has historically co-varied with other aspects of agricultural intensification, it is difficult to quantify the relative impact of herbicides on declining plant diversity. Recent innovations in herbicide-resistance biotechnology will likely lead to changes in herbicide use patterns on U.S. farmland, with major increases in applications of the synthetic-auxin herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba. \n\n    In anticipation of these new biotechnologies, this dissertation provides a timely reassessment of the impacts of herbicides and herbicide-resistant biotechnology on plant diversity resources in agroecosystems. In Chapter Two, I combine data from a detailed floristic survey with a novel application of the species area relationship to explore the relative contributions of crop fields and semi-natural habitats to conserving plant species diversity at landscape scales. In Chapter Three, I report on a set of field trials measuring the extent and concentration of dicamba vapor drift onto non-target areas using different herbicide formulations applied during varying environmental conditions. In Chapter Four, I present a meta-analysis on the dose-response patterns of susceptible soybean and cotton crops to simulated drift of dicamba and 2,4-D and discuss how drift could impact genetic diversity in these crops.  In Chapter Five, I report on a set of multi-year experiments in field edge and old field habitats where I have measured the impacts of drift-level doses of dicamba on the structure and function of beneficial plant communities. \n\n   This research demonstrates that the direct ecotoxicological risks of synthetic-auxin herbicides to plant diversity resources are significant but could be largely mitigated with better herbicide application technologies and practices. However, the larger influences of herbicide-resistant crops in structuring food systems suggest that there will be more significant indirect impacts of these biotechnologies on the future of plant biodiversity resources in agroecosystems. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8335], "author_name_tesi": "Egan, John Franklin", "last_name_ssi": "Egan", "middle_name_ssi": "Franklin", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A Mortensen", "William Curran", "John Frazier Tooker", "Douglas Miller", "Sarah C Goslee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David A Mortensen, Dissertation Advisor", "William Curran, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "Douglas Miller, Committee Member", "Sarah C Goslee, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["agriculture", "agroecology", "herbicides", "herbicide drift biotechnology", "biodiversity", "ecosystem services"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Sex and Citizenship: Contesting the Limits of Democratic Rights-Based Discourse", "id": "7942", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Historically, democratic citizenship in the United States has been underwritten by the freedoms and protections guaranteed by the juridical discourse of rights.  These rights have increasingly become a marker of an individual or group\u2019s inclusion in civil society and, by extension, equal standing as a citizen.  However, access to or exclusion from juridical rights is contingent upon individual and collective identities, with supposed \u201cdeviant\u201d identities suffering the effects of marginalization and subjugation at the fringes of society.  Consequently, American history has seen numerous identity-based movements struggle for inclusion by appealing to the legal system for full coverage under the protective umbrella of rights.  Those with \u201cdeviant\u201d sexual identities have been no exception to this history.  Because battles for sexual rights have taken place primarily in the courtroom, often with contradictory and paradoxical results, this project critically examines the juridical regulation of sexuality through the deployment of a rights-based discourse.  \nI explore the limitations of rights-based juridical discourse in establishing the conditions for a truly egalitarian and democratic politics, especially pertaining to issues of sexuality and citizenship.  These limitations often manifest in the forms of regulatory and normalizing practices, which I contend are facilitated by adherence to the belief in a \u201ctrue,\u201d natural, and essential conception of identity.  In order to contest these limits, I employ a three-part analysis.  I begin with a theoretical overview aimed at contesting the essentiality and immutability of sexual identity.  I illustrate how (homo)sexuality is the product of numerous discursive techniques, and that these techniques result in both the production and regulation of (homo)sexual identities.  Building off of these discussions, I conduct two case-specific analyses examining the ways in which homosexuality is circumscribed by a discourse of rights that, paradoxically, both enables and limits the expression and practices of sexual freedoms.  These examinations focus on appeals made for the right to privacy in opposition to anti-sodomy laws and the struggle for same-sex marriage.  Finally, I attempt to articulate a conception of a democratic and pluralistic ethos that is better able to productively engage the paradoxes and limitations endemic to a politics structured by juridical rights and composed of citizens with conflicting senses of identity. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3361], "author_name_tesi": "Egan, Kevin David", "last_name_ssi": "Egan", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Love", "John Philip Christman", "Errol Anthony Henderson", "Jeffrey Nealon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Love, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Errol Anthony Henderson, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sexuality", "pluralization", "democratic citizenship", "juridical rights"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Symbolic Dynamics of the Weyl Chamber Flow\n\n", "id": "12425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "411", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis studies codings of orbits of Weyl chamber &#64258;ows on symmetric spaces\nof non-compact type.</br>\nLet H be the hyperbolic plane with constant curvature &#8722;1 and &#915; be a Fuchsian\ngroup of &#64257;nite covolume.

A technique to selectively plate gold on the n-type regions of modulation-doped silicon nanowires for junction delineation was developed. The ability to electrolessly deposit metal on segments of nanowires could also facilitate electrical contact formation. More complicated structures such as controlled placement of forks along the nanowire could be made by placement of the gold catalyst at predetermined locations along a nanowire followed by a second growth. Additionally, a process was developed that focuses on using this plating ability to grow silicon nanowires horizontally from pre-determined locations. The processing was worked out and nanowires were grown horizontally from plated gold, but the selectivity of gold limited the ability to grow wires in only the desired locations.\nA silicon nanowire local electrode atom probe test structure is discussed from the initial design steps to successfully using the test structure to analyze silicon nanowires. Initial results using laser pulsed assisted local electrode atom probe indicated that the thermal properties of the nanowire prevent the tip from cooling fast enough and resulted in large thermal tails in the mass spectra. Thermal modeling was used to identify what nanowire diameters and metal coatings would allow the nanowire tip to cool sufficiently fast. A silver catalyzed silicon nanowire with a diameter large enough to allow for sufficient cooling was analyzed, and the concentration of silver in the silicon nanowire was below the detection limit of 10 ppm or 5 x 10^17 cm-3.\nThe growth and characterization of Al catalyzed silicon nanowires is also discussed. Nanowires were grown at higher pressures and using H2 as a carrier gas resulting in much higher growth rates than previously observed for Al catalyzed nanowires in the literature. The nanowires were characterized by electron microscopy and found to be single crystal and to grow oriented to the growth substrate.\n4-pt electrical resistivity measurements of the silicon nanowires were made. The resistivity measured ranged from of 0.005-0.017 &#937;-cm, corresponding to an impurity concentration 7 x 10^18 to 2 x 10^19 cm-3 assuming bulk mobility. Calculations show that possible error from depletion at the surface has only a small effect on the calculated resistivity for a 100 nm diameter nanowire at this high of a doping concentration. The results of LEAP metrology analysis of the Al catalyzed nanowires show an estimated Al concentration of 0.4 atomic percent or 2 x 10^20 cm-3 about 200 nm from the nanowire tip, where the concentration appears to have leveled out.

Radial p-n junction silicon nanowire arrays allow for the decoupling of the directions of light absorption and carrier collection, which allows for the possibility of increased efficiencies. Prior device modeling studies have demonstrated that increased carrier collection can be obtained in radial p-n junction nanowires when the wire radius is approximately equal to the minority carrier diffusion length in the material.  Consequently, radial p-n junction silicon nanowires are anticipated to enable increased efficiency in solar cells fabricated with less pure and therefore potentially lower cost silicon. Fabrication of these structures on low cost substrates such as glass would then enable a further cost reduction. The overall objective of this thesis was the development of processes for the fabrication of radial p-n silicon nanowires (SiNWs) using bottom-up nanowire growth techniques on silicon and glass substrates.\nVapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth was carried out on Si(111) substrates using SiCl4 as the silicon precursor. Growth conditions including temperature, PSiCl4, PH2, and position were investigated to determine the optimum growth conditions for epitaxially oriented silicon nanowire arrays. The experiments revealed that the growth rate of the silicon nanowires exhibits a maximum as a function of PSiCl4 and PH2.  Gas phase equilibrium calculations were used in conjunction with a mass transport model to explain the experimental data. The modeling results demonstrate a similar maximum in the mass of solid silicon predicted to form as a function of PSiCl4 and PH2, which results from a change in the gas phase concentration of SiHxCly and SiClx species.  This results in a shift in the process from growth to etching with increasing PSiCl4.  In general, for the atmospheric pressure conditions employed in this study, growth at higher temperatures >1000\u00b0C and higher SiCl4 concentrations gave the best results. TEM analysis of silicon nanowires grown at different SiCl4 concentrations revealed no distinct differences in the structural properties of the SiNWs. Doping of the SiNWs using trimethylboron (TMB) was also examined.  Gated I-V measurements demonstrated that the SiNWs exhibited p-type behavior. Wires doped with a TMB/SiCl4 ratio of 0.1 had a resistivity in the range of 10-3 &#8486;-cm. However, wires with a TMB/SiCl4 ratio of 2x10-3 exhibited a resistivity of 103 &#8486;-cm. \nThe growth of silicon nanowire arrays on anodized alumina (AAO)-coated glass substrates was also investigated. Glass will not hold up to the high temperatures required for Si nanowire growth with SiCl4 so SiH4 was used as the Si precursor instead. Initial studies were carried out to measure the resistivity of p-type and n-type silicon nanowires grown in free-standing AAO membranes.  A series of nanowire samples were grown in which the doping and the nanowire length inside the membrane were varied.  Circular metal contacts were deposited on the top surface of the membranes and the resistance of the nanowire arrays was measured.  The measured resistance versus nanowire length was plotted and the nanowire resistivity was extracted from the slope. The resistivity of the silicon nanowires grown in the AAO membranes was then compared to the resistivity of silicon nanowires grown on Si and measured using single wire four-point measurements. It was determined that the undoped silicon nanowires grown in AAO have a lower resistivity compared to nanowires grown on Si substrates. This indicates the presence of an unintentional acceptor. The resistivity of the silicon nanowires was found to change as the dopant/SiH4 ratio was varied during growth. The growth and doping conditions developed from this study were then used to fabricate p-type SiNW arrays on the AAO coated glass substrates. \nThe final investigation in this thesis focused on the development of a process for radial coating of an n-type Si layer on the p-type Si nanowires.  While prior studies demonstrated the fabrication of polycrystalline n-type Si shell layers on Si nanowires, an epitaxial n-type Si shell layer is ultimately of interest to obtain a high quality p-n interface.  Initial n-type Si thin film deposition studies were carried out on sapphire substrates using SiH4 as the silicon precursor to investigate the effect of growth conditions on thickness uniformity, growth rate and doping level.  High growth temperatures (>900oC)  are generally desired for achieving epitaxial growth; however, gas phase depletion of the SiH4 source along the length of the reactor resulted in poor thickness uniformity. To improve the uniformity, the substrate was shifted closer to the gas inlet at higher temperatures (950\u00b0C) and the total flow of gas through the reactor was increased to 200 sccm. A series of n-type doping experiments were also carried out. Hall measurements indicated n-type behavior and four-point measurements yielded a change in resistivity based on the PH3/SiH4 ratio. Pre-coating sample preparation was determined to be important for achieving a high quality Si shell layer. Since Au can diffuse down the sides of the nanowire during sample cooldown after growth, the Au tips were etched away prior to shell layer deposition. The effect of deposition temperature on the structural properties of the shell layer deposited on the VLS grown SiNWs was investigated. TEM revealed that the n-type Si shells were polycrystalline at low temperatures (650oC) but were single crystal at 950\u00b0C. SiNW samples grown on glass were also coated; however, due to the temperature constraints, the maximum temperature used was 650oC and therefore the n-type Si shells were polycrystalline. \nSiNW arrays grown using SiCl4 on Si(111) substrates were grown with a high degree of orientation and average growth rates of 3-4 \u00b5m/min at temperatures of 1050\u00b0C. Modeling results indicated the nanowire growth was limited by mass transport. SiNW arrays were also grown using SiH4 on AAO coated glass. Epitaxial n-type Si regrowth was demonstrated on SiNW arrays grown on Si(111) with SiCl4. The n-type Si deposition was carried out using SiH4 at 950\u00b0C and a total pressure of 3 Torr. SiNWs grown on AAO coated glass substrates were also radially coated with n-type Si; however, due to temperature limitations the shell was polycrystalline. Future work on this project could include a study on the doping of SiNWs grown using SiCl4. Device measurements using the radial p-n junction SiNW arrays fabricated could also be carried out. Finally, a study on the effects of sample preparation, nanowire, and n-type shell doping could be correlated to the device measurements.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5674], "author_name_tesi": "Eichfeld, Sarah M", "last_name_ssi": "Eichfeld", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Christopher Muhlstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SiNWs", "nanowire solar cells", "SiNW growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Experience of Using Reflective Journals on an Outward Bound Course\n", "id": "9463", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1390", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract:\n\tThe writing literature specifies that cognitive mechanisms are used both in learning to write and also in writing to learn.  Numerous studies have documented the positive effects on learning that occur through writing and perpetuating these learnings in the reflective journal.

Reflective journaling research, in the fields of outdoor and adult education is scarce, but when combined with other data mechanisms assist in consciousness-raising and expression.  What is notably lacking in the research is how learners actually experience reflective journaling while engaged in their learning.  \n\tThe purpose of this qualitative, phenomenological and heuristic study during a North Carolina Outward Bound course was to: 1) explore the lived experience of participants\u2019 personal development through their reflective journals, and 2) explore the lived experience of participants\u2019 social development through their reflective journals.  Seven participants, including the researcher, answered daily questions in their reflective journals.  In addition, the researcher used interviews, observations and daily evening debriefings as strategies to explore the phenomena of the lived experiences of using reflective journals on their Outward Bound course.  The data was further triangulated through a follow-up final position statement and through member-checking.  Findings of this study indicated that the participants\u2019 experience of reflective journaling was essential in their learning and Outward Bound experience.  \n\tIn particular, four themes emerged from the reflective journal analysis: 1) introspection, 2) crew cohesiveness, 3) reactions to journaling, and 4) phenomenon of reflective journaling.  The reflective journaling experience led participants to express their feelings and become cognizant of personal and social consciousness related to increased levels of humbleness, awarenesses of satisfaction and appreciation, inhibitive self-imposed limits, determination, self-belief and confidence.

We develop a multiple period mixed integer programming model that takes into account the variation in demand that occurs in the forecasted demands for raw materials from one month to another. Later, we allow for backorders and introduce a service level criterion for each of the raw material. The model also includes the cost of holding inventory and a fixed cost of ordering whenever an order is placed during a given period.\nThe model is illustrated with real data collected from a health and hygiene company that operates in more than 35 countries around the globe. For this case study, inventory, financial information, leadtimes and demand information are collected. Raw materials demand requirements in turn relates to the demand of finished goods through the Bill of Materials (BOM) structure. Thus, finished goods demand is characterized so raw materials demand can be accurately estimated. Financial information includes procurement, transportation, administrative and holding costs, as well as suppliers\u2019 discounts policies or any other costs related to stocking up raw materials. Order lead-times, which account for supplier processing time, shipping and administrative times due to orders consolidation and handling, have also been taken into account.\nThe model was run monthly, on a rolling horizon basis, over the entire planning horizon, and only the results obtained for the period in which the model was run (namely, the first month) was implemented each time. By doing this, we were able to capture the changes in the forecasted demand from month to month and the variations in the raw materials delivery schedule. Finally, recommendations regarding the implementation of the proposed policy, as well as future issues, such as demand and lead time variations, have been discussed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4545], "author_name_tesi": "Eidelman, Moises ", "last_name_ssi": "Eidelman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Moises", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Felisa Del Carmen Preciado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor", "Felisa Del Carmen Preciado, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["real applications", "supply chain management", "inventory model"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING THE CLEARVIEW TYPEFACE SYSTEM AND HIGHWAY STANDARD ALPHABETS SERIES FOR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CONTRAST SIGNS", "id": "5138jd84x", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As an important communication tool on roadway systems, traffic signs are commonly used by drivers to navigate to their destinations, avoid potential risks, and be aware of traffic laws and regulations. Therefore, the design, placement, operational effects, maintenance requirements, and uniformity of traffic signs should be considered carefully to maximize the effectiveness of these signs to fulfill drivers\u2019 needs for traffic information in different driving environments. To determine the effectiveness of signs, many factors can be taken into consideration. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) describes the desired sign design characteristics for sign use on highways including long visibility distances, large lettering and symbols and short legends for quick comprehension. To provide a solid basis for these assertions on the manual and other references, it is necessary to develop effective evaluation methods to support the transportation regulations and policies.  \nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of traffic sign typeface systems in regard to their legibility distances and glance legibility. Legibility distance is defined as the maximum distance at which a driver is able to correctly read the sign. Glance legibility measures a driver\u2019s ability to read a sign in a brief period of visual exposure. For this dissertation, two experiments were conducted \u2013 a field test (Experiment 1) and a laboratory experiment (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 determined the legibility distances of the Clearview Typeface System and the Standard Highway Alphabet during daytime and nighttime conditions. Three types of inter-letter spacing, three letter weights, and two letter heights of negative contrast Clearview fonts (mixed-case) were compared with three Standard Highway Alphabets fonts (mixed and all-uppercase). The positive contrast Clearview font and Standard Highway Alphabets were compared, as well, to re-establish the baseline performance seen in other research. Experiment 2 developed a measured approach to simulate the phenomenon when drivers obtain sign information during a brief exposure and evaluate their glance legibility under certain conditions. The glance legibility threshold, duration time, and the participants\u2019 response accuracy were tested as measures of performance in Experiment 2. \nThree letter weights of positive and negative contrast Clearview fonts (mixed-case) were compared to three Standard Highway Alphabets (mixed and all-uppercase). The results of the experiment demonstrated the typeface effect along with evaluations considering inter-letter spacing, letter height, and color contrast. The most important objective of Experiment 1 was to evaluate the negative contrast Clearview fonts and Standard Highway Alphabets with an eye toward improving the readability of negative contrast highway signs that are commonly used as regulatory and warning signs. The research results showed that overall the Clearview fonts (mixed-case) were as legible as the Standard Highway Alphabets in all-uppercase, and the Clearview words took up less sign space than the all-uppercase signs. As for mixed-case, two of three Clearview typefaces were found to be significantly better when compared to the Standard Highway Alphabets Series, with over 30 percent improvements during daytime testing. The results of the nighttime experiments found that two of three Clearview typefaces performed better than the Standard Highway Alphabets Series with over 20 percent improvements. The results also indicated that over 56 percent of the older drivers could read the negative contrast Clearview fonts farther away than the Standard Highway Alphabets with all conditions combined.  \nExperiment 2 confirmed that viewing distance, exposure time, and typeface would affect research subjects\u2019 performance to read the information on a sign correctly. When all stimuli were displayed in 50 to 750 millisecond presentations, the logistic regression model formulations allowed for an estimate or prediction of the probabilities of a sign panel \u201cbeing read by drivers correctly\u201d for each typeface based on the experimental design. To test human capacities and limitations, the Clearview fonts and Standard Highway Alphabets were compared based on research subjects\u2019 response accuracy rate for exposure times under 100 milliseconds. At a 300-foot viewing distance, the accuracy rates for negative contrast Clearview typefaces were higher than the comparable Standard Highway Alphabets (mixed-case). The percentages of differences between the Clearview fonts and Standard Highway Alphabets increased as the exposure time reduced. The experimental process and method developed and applied in Experiment 2 could be used to evaluate various types of traffic sign stimuli or alternative transportation typefaces. \nAll of these results should provide useful information to expand traffic sign legibility criteria and enhance transportation information system design guidance. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12228], "author_name_tesi": "Eie, Wei-Yin ", "last_name_ssi": "Eie", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei-Yin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin T.

Kerogen-carbon isotopic compositions (delta-[super]13C[sub]ker) for a 150 Ma record from the Hamersley Province, Western Australia show a -58 to -27\u2030 spread in kerogen-carbon isotopic values. Lithofacies association with kerogen-carbon isotope patterns for the entire period indicate that shallow-water carbonate facies received relatively greater inputs of photosynthate biomass relative to biomass from recycled organic carbon (i.e. methane recycling and chemoautotrophic recycling of [super]13C-depleted carbon dioxide).  In addition, results indicate that a \u201cmethane signature\u201d (extreme [super]13C-depletion; <-45\u2030) is strongly associated with restricted and deep-water environments and that in other environments, particularly open, shallow-water carbonates, the relative proportion of recycled organic carbon was lower and declined further over time.\n\nMolecular analysis of both extracted free biomarkers and thermally cleaved bound-biomarkers provides strong supporting evidence for the syngenicity of molecular fossils in these late Archean rocks. Biomarkers indicate microbial diversity including evidence for oxygenic photosynthesizing cyanobacteria, eukaryotic algae, aerobic methylotrophs, and, possibly, green sulfur bacteria. The discovery of >C20 acyclic isoprenoids, including squalane, in these bitumens provides the first molecular evidence for the Archaea Domain at 2.72 Ga. Moreover, the presence of quaternary-branched alkanes suggests input from chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in slope environments.\nBoth isotopic and molecular results support the onset and expansion of marine oxygenation during the late Archean prior to the rise of atmospheric oxygen at ~2.3 Ga. The extreme [super]13C-depletion is attributed to recycling of organic carbon, potentially by anaerobic methane oxidation, despite molecular evidence for the activities of aerobic methylotrophs in late Archean environments.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2773], "author_name_tesi": "Eigenbrode, Jennifer L", "last_name_ssi": "Eigenbrode", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Earth Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman", "Christopher Howard House", "Robert David Minard", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Roger E Summons"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Robert David Minard, Committee Member", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Member", "Roger E Summons, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Precambrian", "biomarkers", "oxygen", "bacteria", "respiration", "methylotrophy", "carbon", "Hamersley Province", "hopanes", "steranes", "isoprenoids", "sulfur", "paleoenvironments", "marine", "anoxia"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Health Journey of College Women with Eating Disorder Behaviors: A Qualitative Study on the Use and Unintended Consequences of Mobile Weight Loss Applications", "id": "14441exe145", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14441", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "College can be a stressful time for students. During this transitional phase, many young women face new challenges, including unique social and academic stressors, which increase the risk of developing eating disorders and eating disorder behaviors. In fact, it is estimated that 7% to 18% of college women screen positive for eating disorders. College women are also increasingly using mobile health applications for diet, physical activity, and weight loss (weight loss apps) even when weight loss may be unnecessary. These apps support dieting and promote the thin ideal, which are related to the development of eating disorders. Thus, the combination of the college environment and use of weight loss apps may further exacerbate eating disorder behaviors among this population. However, the usage and consequences of weight loss apps in the context of eating disorders is not well known. \n\tSome aspects of weight loss apps may be helpful for eating disorder recovery while others may inhibit recovery and even harm users. Significant research exists on weight loss apps and the quantification of health behaviors, known as the quantified self, in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, most of these studies view weight loss apps as a positive influence on users and a way to combat the obesity epidemic in the United States. While the negative effects of social media and pro-eating disorder communities have been well studied, this research tends to ignore the potential negative implications of weight loss apps. In terms of positive use and impact, research tends to focus on online eating disorder support communities and treatment apps and often neglects potential positive aspects of non-eating disorder specific technologies, such as weight loss apps.    \n\tIn this dissertation study, I address these limitations in existing research by conducting a qualitative study, which includes think-aloud exercises and semi-structured interviews, with college women with eating disorder behaviors. The bulk of this research rests on the main study, which aims to understand the usage and unintended consequences of weight loss apps among this population. Through this research, I provide an understanding of why college women with eating disorder behaviors use weight loss apps, descriptions of how weight loss apps are used, and descriptions of unintended negative and positive consequences. \n\tThis dissertation study is important because it is among the first research to consider the role of weight loss apps in the context of eating disorders. Findings from this research contribute to our understanding of eating disorders and app design. Specifically, I present a conceptual understanding of an individual\u2019s health journey, which includes the changing nature of app use and the mutual influence between an individual and technology. Then I provide an identification of problematic aspects of design, which challenges the current narrative about weight loss apps. Based on problematic aspects of design, I make design suggestions, which are important for designing future weight loss apps and other similar health technologies to focus more on promoting healthy behaviors. This research emphasizes the need for a fundamental shift in how we think about and design for health within apps.

The overarching question asks how this event impacts contemporary manifestations and discussions of minority communities within the French nation-state. In existence since 2002, the march presents a unique and engaging opportunity to illuminate the evolution of French ideas of \u201cproper\u201d citizenship roles through critical, theoretical, and empirical inquiry. As a public forum for overt sexual(ized) expression(s), the marche de la visibilit\u00e9 offers participants the opportunity to present themselves as a cohesive community, even where one may not necessarily exist in reality. By making themselves \u201cvisible\u201d to spectators, participants are able to critique societal norms not only through linguistic signs but also physical presence. In order to provide a comprehensive study of the event and its impact upon contemporary manifestations of difference, this dissertation examines the marche de la visibilit\u00e9 from four different angles. First, by tracing the evolution of citizenship within the French nation-state, I uncover and emphasize not only its inclusionary but also exclusionary nature. Next, I turn to a discussion of the symbolic power associated with space and place. Taking inspiration from scholars such as Maurice Agulhon, James Lehning, and Michel de Certeau, I build upon their work to frame my understanding of the ways in which politically motivated groups appropriate and actualize the spaces they occupy. I argue that through their repeated usage of the space, the marche de la visibilit\u00e9 is able to alter our normalized perceptions of the city. Following this discussion, I undertake an analysis of a study I designed and conducted during the 2008 edition of the march. Here I employed a closed-question attitude survey where participants were asked to reflect upon their position vis-\u00e0-vis the march and its importance to them in order to discern any statistically significant differences between participants. What came to the surface were variations between self-identified gay men and lesbians. Overall, lesbians tended to view the march as more important in many ways, while gay men leaned towards more tepid responses. I interpreted this to be indicative of the relative invisibility of lesbians within the public sphere, where the opportunity to present themselves as lesbians to spectators represents a major perquisite. In the final chapter, I turn to an analysis of the linguistic messages displayed by participants and the power these messages have to either align or distance the message bearers with/from spectators in an effort to understand the discourses that are deployed in their attempts to gain political visibility. Shedding light upon an understudied facet of French and Francophone culture, this dissertation furthers our understanding of minority groups and the manner in which they appropriate, actualize, and transform debates of identity in contemporary France.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3771], "author_name_tesi": "Eilderts, Luke L", "last_name_ssi": "Eilderts", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Luke", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Barbara E Bullock", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Vera Mark", "Heather Mccoy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Dissertation Advisor", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Chair", "Barbara E Bullock, Committee Chair", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Vera Mark, Committee Member", "Heather Mccoy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sexuality", "citizenship", "sexual citizenship", "France", "gay pride", "Strasbourg"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Love, Desire, Individuation: Intersections of Plato, Schelling and Deleuze\n", "id": "11431", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5544", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using an ontological framework derived from the work of Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, and Gilbert Simondon, my dissertation reinterprets the accounts of love found in Schelling\u2019s Ages of the World and Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Symposium.

In doing so, I hope to explain an event (love) which is itself formative of, and hence excessive to, human or even divine subjectivity.

Analyzing Schelling\u2019s concept of \u201cdivine love\u201d and Plato\u2019s concept of eros, I argue, first, that there are important isomorphisms between the two forms of love; and second, that in each case, love can best be understood as an emergent feature of a larger system in which the experiencing subject is caught up.

These bands, classified in this study as dominant bands, commonly produce heavy, localized snowfall and extend significant distances inland, resulting in high societal impact.  Hazards associated with these bands underscore the importance of understanding the inland structure of dominant bands and accurately forecasting their inland extent.  \n\tAccordingly, the first focus of this dissertation is on elucidating those factors important to the inland penetration of Lake Ontario Lake-Long-Axis Parallel (LLAP) bands (LLAP bands are a subset of dominant bands and occur frequently over and downwind of Lake Ontario).  Statistical relationships between the inland penetration of LLAP-band radar echoes and environmental variables are examined for 34 cases of LLAP bands observed during the Ontario Winter Lake-effect Systems (OWLeS) field campaign.  This analysis reveals that inland penetration is strongly correlated with boundary layer depth and with cold air advection in the upper portion of the boundary layer.  The latter result suggests that boundary-layer destabilization produced by vertically-differential cold air advection may be an inland power source for preexisting LLAP bands; this power production is quantified through atmospheric energetics.  Statistical models for predicting inland penetration are also developed using stepwise regression.  The most skillful of these models uses boundary layer depth and temperature advection in the upper portion of the boundary layer to explain 76% of the variance in observed inland penetration (when tested on independent data).  \n\tThe second focus of this work is on the inland structure of dominant bands and the interaction of these bands with environmental baroclinicity.  Band structure is examined using WRF reanalyses with 3 km horizontal resolution and an innovative technique for assessing the most representative member from the WRF ensemble.  Three reanalysis periods are examined, encompassing 185 total simulation hours; of these hours, dominant bands were detected during 155 hours.  It is discovered that, within the reanalysis periods, synoptic-scale baroclinicity is common in both the east-west and north-south dimensions; the various sources of this baroclinicity are also discussed.  Three simulation hours are then selected for in-depth case studies.  These case studies reveal a wide range of interactions of dominant bands with synoptic-scale baroclinicity, which are discussed in detail.  The case studies suggest that baroclinicity strongly influences the inland structure of dominant bands.  Finally, the synthesis and implications of these results are discussed.

There is strong evidence that aminoacylation of tRNA may be involved in such pathways. \nPrevious research has shown that aminoacylation or charging of tRNA is important for efficient nuclear export of tRNA.  Temperature sensitive mutations of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases resulted in nuclear accumulation of tRNA in yeast.  In addition, if the nuclear pool of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was reduced in the cell, the cell accumulated tyrosyl-tRNA in the nucleus.  Overexpression of methionyl-tRNA synthetase in los1\u0192\u00b4 strain corrected the nuclear accumulation of methionyl-tRNA. Mutation of CCA1, an enzyme that adds the acceptor arm to the tRNA, a necessary first step in the charging of tRNAs, resulted in nuclear accumulation of tRNA.  In addition, over expression of CCA1 in los1\u0192\u00b4 strains resulted in correction of the nuclear accumulation of a majority of tRNAs.  Overall, these results strongly indicated that aminoacylation was critical for tRNA transport.\nA biochemical screen of proteins implicated in tRNA nuclear export was initiated to elucidate the mechanism of aminoacylation in tRNA nuclear egress.  By examining the protein-protein and tRNA-protein interactions in nuclear tRNA transport, a better understanding of nuclear tRNA export is possible.  Gst-tagged versions of the two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, TYS1 and ILS1, were found to complement their respective temperature sensitive mutants.  Each protein was purified and was able to aminoacylate tRNA in vitro.  Both proteins co-purified with their cognate tRNAs.  The tRNAs were released in high salt.  Interestingly, Gst-Tys1p also co-purified with Gat4p, a possible nitrogen-regulated transcription factor and endogenous Tys1p.  Gst-Ils1p did not co-purify with any other proteins.\n  Exhaustive attempts were made to identify components of the tRNA transport/maturation pathway by searching for proteins that co-purified with Tys1p and Ils1p, but no known components of this pathway were found.  An alternative approach with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, MES1 and mes1-1 was taken to reach the same goal.  The Mes1-1p has a single amino acid substitution and previous work demonstrated temperature sensitive growth as well as tRNA nuclear accumulation at the nonpermissive temperature.  The temperature sensitive growth phenotype was restored by the addition of methionine to the media and published data showed that the mutant protein has 100-fold less binding affinity for methionine as compared to Mes1p, suggesting Mes1-1p is compromised in aminoacylation activity.  If Mes1-1p is only defective in aminoacylation and has normal tRNA binding, the tRNA nuclear accumulation phenotype could be due to a defect in aminoacylation rather than tRNA binding.  To test this hypothesis, I attempted to compare the tRNA binding affinity between Gst-Mes1p and Gst-Mes1-1p.  It was determined that Gst-Mes1-1p is likely a less stable protein than Gst-Mes1p and therefore a clear conclusion on the role of aminoacylation and tRNA binding could not be made.  \nSOL1 was found to be a multicopy suppressor of los1\u0192\u00b4, which suggests that SOL1 may function in a Los1p-independent tRNA export pathway.  A functional, tagged version of the gene was constructed and the encoded protein was purified.  Gst-Sol1p co-purified with Tef1/2p, the elongation factor 1 alpha.  Tef1/2p has been shown to bind aminoacylated tRNA and to facilitate the movement of tRNA into the A site of the ribosome.  Even though Tef1/2p was known to bind tRNA, tRNA did not co-purify with Sol1p and Tef1/2p, which suggested this interaction is not tRNA dependent.\nThis newly discovered Sol1p/Tef1p complex might form the basis for an aminoacylation-dependent tRNA export pathway in which Sol1p binds Tef1p importing Tef1p into the nucleus.  Tef1p could then bind aminoacylated tRNA, releasing Sol1p with Tef1p moving out of the nucleus carrying tRNA, thereby functioned as an aminoacylation-dependent tRNA nuclear export pathway.\nRNAs in the eukaryotic cells were originally thought to function as structural components of the protein translation.  Recently, RNAs are found to edit RNA sequences and to act in the catalytic roles.  Now it appears that RNAs may regulate the expression of the genome and may be integral to the proper development of many multicellular organisms.  This process is called double stranded RNA interference (RNAi).\nRNAi has been found in many different organisms across many eukaryotic families.  RNAi is the silencing of mRNA with high sequence homology to a dsRNA initiator molecule.  The mechanism and regulation of RNAi is still poorly understood.  A strong, easily manipulated genetic model for RNAi would be invaluable to study RNAi.  Therefore, we attempted to use Saccharomyces cerevisiae to develop such as model.\nA plasmid that was expected to express a double stranded RNA was transformed into yeast.  A GFP gene under a GAL1 promoter was transformed into the cells.  The dsRNA was targeted against the negative regulator of the GAL regulon, GAL80.  The dsRNA construct activated the expression of GFP.  RNAi was expected, based on all previous published research, to reduce the levels of GAL80 mRNA and produce 21-23 bp RNAs (siRNA) against the GAL80 mRNA.  The dsRNA induced expression of GFP in yeast failed to show a reduction of GAL80 mRNAs or proteins.  No siRNAs were detected.  These data suggested that the dsRNA activation of GFP was not due to classical RNAi, but due to a nonspecific RNAi reaction or another unknown dsRNA activation of the GAL regulon.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1471], "author_name_tesi": "Eisaman, Duane ", "last_name_ssi": "Eisaman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Duane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anitia Hopper", "Hui Ling Chiang", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Thomas Wright Gardner", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anitia Hopper, Committee Chair", "Hui Ling Chiang, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Thomas Wright Gardner, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tRNA", "yeast", "RNAi", "Export", "cerevisiae", "Sol1"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Assessment of Pennsylvania's Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program: Riparian Forest Buffer Participants and Successful Tree Establishment", "id": "22741", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Riparian forest buffers have been considered one of the best management practices for improving water quality in stream ecosystems in North America in areas where forest cover was the predominant land cover. Afforestation in riparian areas can be a slow and difficult process and presents many challenges for successful establishment of streamside forests for natural resource professionals and private landowners. One of the many conservation programs that offer assistance to private landowners for the establishment of riparian forest buffers is the USDA Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP). This program provides technical assistance and financial incentives to landowners to retire their riparian lands from production and install riparian forest buffers. This study explores the attitudes and opinions of landowners enrolled in Pennsylvania CREP riparian forest buffer initiative. It investigates the motivations for actions taken to ensure successful establishment of the trees as well as future plans for the buffer. A mail questionnaire was developed and administered to 538 CREP riparian forested buffer participants in 43 Pennsylvania counties.\nThis study identified some of the underlying factors that led to engagement and active participation in the maintenance of riparian forest buffers by private landowners in Pennsylvania. The participant response to the questionnaire yielded distinct patterns in landowner attitudes, level of engagement, and understanding of maintenance required for the successful establishment of their riparian forest buffer. Pennsylvania CREP riparian forest buffer participants indicated a strong motivation for improving water quality and environmental stewardship that led them to enroll their streamside land in CREP for the establishment of a riparian forest buffer. Results confirm that frequency of visits and the perceived importance of maintenance tasks by program participants were significant predictors of the level of engagement in maintenance of the riparian buffer. Landowners who participated in this study had a clearly stated intention to keep the riparian forest buffer intact when their contract expired and to continue program participation by re-enrolling their forest buffer for an additional 10 or 15 years. Landowner attitudes and beliefs about environmental stewardship, improving water quality, the aesthetic value of streamside buffers, and wildlife habitat guided their decision making about voluntary conservation and restoration efforts over the long term. Possible management implications for these findings are advanced.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9549], "author_name_tesi": "Eisenbise, Stephanie Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Eisenbise", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Craig Finley", "Albert E Luloff", "Allyson Muth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Craig Finley, Thesis Advisor", "Albert E Luloff, Thesis Advisor", "Allyson Muth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["riparian forest buffer", "streamside forest", "CREP", "private lands", "farmers", "motivations", "maintenance", "tree establishment"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "EXAMINING THE PREDICTORS OF DEPRESSION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN CARE", "id": "15243szj149", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15243", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Depression is most prevalent co-morbid condition among people living with HIV (PLWH), yet many PLWH with depression are either undiagnosed or untreated with depression, due to a lack of understanding of depression among PLWH.

Many factors have been examined and depression is one of the reasons of lost in care. To gain a better understanding of depression among PLWH, this study applied the International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF) framework to identify health conditions, environmental factors, and personal factors associated with depression among a sample of 835 individuals who received HIV medical services from a HIV clinic in south-central Pennsylvania. The study used a longitudinal data of ten years to incorporate episodic nature of HIV and depression to examine the longitudinal relationship of depression and the variables that changes over time including HIV progression (CD4 count). To control the cluster effect from a person, multilevel modeling was adopted. \n\tThe results of this retrospective study indicate that White individuals are more likely to report a diagnosis of depression than African or Black individuals. Women are also more likely to report depression than men. In terms of the variables that change over time, further HIV progression measured by CD4 count predicted higher prevalence of depression. People are also more likely to report depression when they are younger, or they live with income lower than the federal poverty level. Dur to the rural nature of the sample, Black/African American individuals are underrepresented in the sample.

Al-tajr\u012bb emerged as an alternative mode to the realist model of Egyptian Nobel laureate Naj\u012bb Ma\u1e25f\u016b\u1e93 (Naguib Mahfouz) (b. 1911-d. 2006), a model which influenced a number of novelists in Morocco. By contrasting experimental novels by Moroccan litt\u00e9rateurs to the realist model of the classical European novel and the classical Arabic novel, I do not imply that Moroccan and Arab novelistic experimentalism is un-realistic or treat the unreal. At stake in my dissertation is the new definition of \u201crealism\u201d that emerges through the practices and discourses of experimental fiction. Rather than proposing \u201crealism\u201d as a mimetic literary mode based on descriptive prose, what we see instead is a politics of form and a formalization of politics that work through the fusion of multiple narrative voices and layers, a reliance on the technique of fragmentation, the inclusion of a metafictional discourse that interrupts the narrative in order to reflect on the morphology and goal of literary writing, and so forth. As Moroccan novelist-critic A\u1e25mad al-Mad\u012bn\u012b points out, experimental formal features such as the \u201cbreaking and interpenetration of [narrative] times [and] the multiplicity of voices\u201d constitute \u201clegitimate attributes to a novelistic world [. . .] a tragic vision\u201d (Qtd. in Ab\u016b \u1e24am\u0101la 54). In a similar vein, Mu\u1e25ammad Barr\u0101dah, another prominent novelist-critic, notes that the \u201cexperimental takeoff\u201d in Moroccan and Arab novelistic writing could be read as \u201ca period of venting and settling of accounts with a handicapped heritage and an inert history\u201d (al-Riw\u0101yah al-\u02bfArabiyyah, 37-38). Both al-Mad\u012bn\u012b and Barr\u0101dah highlight the ideological implications of the shift in literary representation brought about by Arab experimentalism. I argue that formal experimentalism retains its tie to reality through political exigency. It is derived from a political need to break with continuous history, which turns experimentalism into a discursive site that probes the question of how we do things differently. \n\nIt follows that reality, in its cultural and socio-political ramifications, undergirds Moroccan literary experimentalism. Along with novelist-critic Mu\u1e25ammad Aman\u1e63\u016br, I maintain that \u201crealism is not in contradiction with experimentalism\u201d (Istr\u0101t\u012bjiy\u0101t, 168). The notion of realism in this context is not figural representation of plausible worldly coordinates, but the formal, structural, and linguistic invocation of new subject positions that correspond (implicitly and/or discursively) to immediate contemporary political exigency. Al-Mad\u012bn\u012b remarks that formal experimentalism has sought to establish \u201can extra-realistic relationship\u201d with the social, which positions the individual\u2014not his or her environment\u2014in the center (Ru\u2019yat, 157). This new subject position or positioning is indicative of formal experimentalism\u2019s endeavors to create new discursive spheres for the treatment of the social and the political, and in so doing Moroccan experimental writings become\u2014or make the claim of being\u2014realist. With the politics of formal experimentalism in mind, two parameters inform this dissertation. Firstly, it argues that experimental writings in Morocco are deeply ingrained in social reality\u2014albeit in their own way\u2014and, therefore, should not be seen as invested in formal experimentation for its own sake. That is, experimentalism has a point of reference in the political and socio-cultural arenas. Secondly, it contends that the phenomenon of al-tajr\u012bb (experimentalism) is weary of trends or modes imported from foreign literatures, and seeks to disentangle Moroccan literary activity from the pressures of influence. Moroccan experimentalism emerged out of a state of anxiety with regard to external influences\u2014either from the Mashriq (the Arab East) or from the West\u2014and has continued to explore ways that would set Moroccan literature (especially in the terrain of the novel) on a path towards more autonomy and specificity. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11366], "author_name_tesi": "El Younssi, Anouar ", "last_name_ssi": "El Younssi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anouar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Hoda El Shakry", "Shuang Shen", "Gabeba Baderoon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Eburne, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Committee Chair", "Hoda El Shakry, Committee Member", "Shuang Shen, Committee Member", "Gabeba Baderoon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Moroccan Novel", "Experimentalism", "Arab Experimentalism", "Moroccan Avant-Garde", "Postcolonial Moroccan Novel"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Urban and Rural Teachers' Attitudes and Adherence to Culturally Responsive Pedagogy in the Context of a Racial/ethnic Manipulation ", "id": "16262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7940", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine teachers\u2019 multicultural awareness, attitudes, and self-reported behaviors in the context of culturally relevant pedagogy.

Selective pressure imposed by the interference of the conventional antibiotics with essential processes has resulted in many multi-drug resistant pathogens causing several hospital-acquired and community-borne diseases. Antibiotic development is dwindling and only a limited pool of potential new drugs is available in the pharmaceutical pipeline. As a consequence, there is an urgent need for new molecular targets and new classes of antibiotics.\nRecently, alternative therapeutic strategies have been proposed as new treatment options. One such approach involves identification of compounds that target virulence instead of viability, thereby reducing the likelihood of developing resistance. Particularly, compounds targeting conserved regulators of virulence gene expression are expected to have broad spectrum of activity. This study describes the identification of inhibitors for the \u03c3E-sRNA-Hfq regulatory pathway. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) act in conjunction with the RNA chaperone Hfq to regulate gene expression in bacteria. A subset of sRNAs that regulate expression of outer membrane proteins are transcribed using the alternative sigma factor \u03c3E. Because \u03c3E and Hfq components are required for virulence in several gram-negative pathogens and \u03c3E is required for viability of some other pathogens, the \u03c3E-sRNA-Hfq system is an attractive target for antibiotic development.\nTo identify inhibitors of the \u03c3E-sRNA-Hfq regulatory pathway, a reporter strain was engineered in which OmpC\u2019-YFP expression is controlled by the RybB sRNA. When the system is functional, the ompC\u2019-yfp mRNA is degraded, resulting in no fluorescence. On the other hand, inhibition of any step in the pathway leads to OmpC\u2019-YFP expression and fluorescent cells. This reporter was used in genetic screens to identify inhibitors from a library of cyclic peptides produced in E. coli using SICLOPPS, an intein-based technology. Assays with secondary reporter strains revealed that the identified cyclic peptides targeted different steps of the pathway. \nOne cyclic peptide SI24 was identified as an inhibitor of \u03c3E-dependent transcription but not Hfq-RybB mediated repression. Anisotropy experiments in conjunction with in vitro transcription assays showed that SI24 binds \u03c3E, decreases the affinity of \u03c3E and RNAP and inhibits \u03c3E-RNAP holoenzyme formation. Another screen identified the cyclic peptide RI20, which inhibits Hfq-mediated repression of gene expression in conjunction with both RybB and an unrelated sRNA, MicF.  Gel mobility shift assays showed that RI20 inhibits binding of Hfq to these sRNAs with similar KI values.

In addition to extremely high temperatures, the incoming flow to the turbine components is known to have high freestream turbulence. Turbulent junction flow or horseshoe vortex is a well-known phenomenon observed on the platforms of turbine vanes and blades and is known for causing thermal degradations over time. The turbulent junction flow occurs when a wall boundary layer encounters an obstacle causing the flow to separate from the wall and reorganize into coherent vortices. Previous studies on the horseshoe vortex have demonstrated significant unsteadiness making the flowfield and associated endwall heat transfer complicated. While the time-averaged and time-resolved flowfield and heat transfer measurements of turbulent junction flow have been well-understood, many of these previous studies were conducted in a single Reynolds number and at a baseline freestream turbulence. In this thesis, the effects of Reynolds number and high freestream turbulence on time-averaged and time-resolved flowfield and surface heat transfer measurements are presented. \nThe first study in this thesis focuses on the effects of Reynolds number on the unsteady flowfield and time-averaged endwall heat transfer in the turbulent junction flow using high-speed stereo particle image velocimetry and infrared thermography. The measurements are conducted in a large scale optically accessible wind tunnel with an academic airfoil geometry. Time-mean vortex core position upstream of the wing is unchanged with increasing Reynolds number, but turbulent kinetic energy levels are shown to increase underneath the vortex core. Also, the time-resolved vortex core position is found in somewhat distinct positions at low Reynolds number, and is more broadly distributed at high Reynolds number. Furthermore, the time-averaged heat transfer around the junction changes its distribution around the wing body with increasing Reynolds number. \nThe second study examines the influence of freestream turbulence and Reynolds number on unsteady endwall heat flux measurements using high-speed heat flux micro-sensors. The measurements are taken using the same wind tunnel and airfoil geometry as the first study. A turbulence grid with cylindrical bars has enhanced the freestream turbulence intensity to around 18%. The effects of freestream turbulence on endwall heat transfer are significant at low Reynolds number but are negligible at higher Reynolds number, with heat transfer augmentation due to turbulence varying from 1.20 to 1.00 as Reynolds number increases. The root mean square of the heat flux fluctuations is increased with freestream turbulence at lower Reynolds number. One of the broader conclusions from this study is in the hot section of the gas turbine engines where Reynolds numbers are relatively high, freestream turbulence does not have an impact on endwall heat transfer. However, in lower Reynolds number applications such as in heat exchangers, endwall heat transfer is augmented with higher freestream turbulence. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16290], "author_name_tesi": "Elahi, Syed Samiul", "last_name_ssi": "Elahi", "middle_name_ssi": "Samiul", "first_name_ssi": "Syed", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen P Lynch", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen P Lynch, Thesis Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Junction flow", "Reynolds number", "Turbulence", "Unsteady heat flux", "Junction flow", "Horseshoe vortex", "Reynolds number", "Freestream turbulence", "Heat transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Exploring Children's Optic Flow Sensitivity", "id": "15366", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7789", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Motion cues are important for successful navigation in an environment.  The structured global motion pattern, optic flow, provides a person with speed and direction information about her  self-motion. Prior research has shown that, radial (expansion/contraction) optic flow patterns elicit robust evoked potential responses in adults, while responses to rotation and translation (left/right) patterns are weaker. Comparatively, infants show the strongest evoked responses to lateral translation.  Previous studies also suggest that adult-like spatial and temporal tuning to global motion develops over a prolonged time period. However, the literature is still lacking a component that connects adult and infant optic flow research and provides a clear trajectory of optic flow sensitivity over time. The current study attempts to provide this missing information. For this study, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) responses were recorded from children of 4 to 8-years to coherence modulations of three optic flow pattern types (lateral translation, rotation, and radial expansion/contraction) at 3 different speeds (2, 4, and 8 deg/s), using an electrode net of 128 channels.  Children viewed moving dot displays (7 amin dots, 79.4 cd/m2, density = 10%) that modulated in time from incoherent to 100% coherent global motion at 1.2 Hz (F1). All displays had the same dot update rate (24 Hz, F2).  Overall, responses to coherence modulation were largest for the radial patterns and were tuned for fast speeds. The oldest children were the most adult-like, with weak responses to translation and rotation, but the strongest responses to radial motion.  Robust responses to translation were still observed in the youngest children. The results suggest that adult-like sensitivity to optic flow patterns emerges in middle childhood and that there are multiple trajectories associated with the development of optic flow processing.

Consistent with previous semantic processing ERP studies in typically developing populations, semantically incongruent trials yielded larger negative amplitude responses than semantically congruent trials. While mean amplitudes did not differ significantly by animacy or post-stimulus presentation epoch, brain responses did vary by channel with electrode site C3 displaying the largest negative magnitude compared to other channels. Response latencies were within the range of the N400 observed in typically developing adults.

However, it suffers from recombination losses due\nto low electron mobility and a minority carrier diffusion length of only 2- 4 nm.\nThe primary focus of this dissertation was to synthesize thin walled, self-aligned,\nvertically oriented nanotubular/nanoporous iron (III) oxide structures through\nelectrochemical oxidation. The underlying hypothesis was that thin walled nanotubes\nwould allow charge separation prior to recombination, resulting in a significant increase\nin the photoelectrochemical properties. Both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes were\nexplored as an electrochemical oxidation solvent. Iron oxide film topologies achieved\ninclude nanopillar, nanoporous and nanoplatelet structures from aqueous electrolytes, and\nnanoporous and nanochannel architectures from non-aqueous electrolytes. This\ndissertation encompasses the first report on synthesis of nanoporous/nanochannel iron\n(III) oxide structures through potentiostatic anodization, as well as the use of ethylene\nglycol for the electrochemical oxidation of both iron and titanium.\nThrough control of anodization parameters, including potential and anodization\nbath composition, excellent control over the morphology and dimensions of the\nsynthesized iron (III) nanostructures have been achieved. As dependent upon the applied\npotential and electrolytic composition, diameters of the self-aligned nanopores range\nfrom 30 nm to 250 nm. The synthesized structures were crystallized in nitrogen ambient to form hematite photoanodes; a maximum photocurrent efficiency of 0.73 % was\nobtained from nanoporous iron (III) oxide synthesized using a glycerol anodization bath.\nThe electrochemical oxidation of titanium in fluoride ion containing ethylene\nglycol resulted in remarkable growth characteristics of titania nanotube arrays, hexagonal\nclosed packed up to 1 mm in length, with tube aspect ratios of approximately 10,000. For\nthe first time, complete anodization of the starting titanium foil has been demonstrated\nresulting in back to back nanotube array membranes ranging from 360 \u00b5m \u2013 1 mm in\nlength. The nanotubes exhibited growth rates of up to 15 \u00b5m/hr. A detailed study on the\nfactors affecting the growth rate and nanotube dimensions is presented. It is suggested\nthat faster high field ionic conduction through a thinner barrier layer is responsible for the\nhigher growth rates observed in electrolytes containing ethylene glycol. Methods to\nfabricate free standing, titania nanotube array membranes ranging in thickness from 50\n\u00b5m \u2013 1000 \u00b5m has also been an outcome of this dissertation.\nIn an effort to combine the charge transport properties of titania with the light\nabsorption properties of iron (III) oxide, films comprised of vertically oriented Ti-Fe-O\nnanotube arrays on FTO coated glass substrates have been successfully synthesized in\nethylene glycol electrolytes. Depending upon the Fe content the bandgap of the resulting\nfilms varied from about 3.26 to 2.17 eV. The Ti-Fe oxide nanotube array films\ndemonstrated a photocurrent of 2 mA/cm2 under global AM 1.5 illumination with a 1.2%\n(two-electrode) photoconversion efficiency, demonstrating a sustained, time-energy\nnormalized hydrogen evolution rate by water splitting of 7.1 mL/W\u2022hr in a 1 M KOH\nsolution with a platinum counter electrode under an applied bias of 0.7 V.

In this newly emerging focus on how the brain functions as a network, a network is represented by a series of regions (nodes) and the connections between them (edges). One domain in which the network level approach has made great strides is in face-processing, but there still many important questions remaining with regards to how individual differences in connectivity relate to differences in face-processing behaviors. In this project, I used state-of-the art connectivity methods to address the following questions: 1) is variation in face recognition behavior related to variation in the topologic organization of the face-processing network, 2) how do the relation between network organization and behavior change when viewing faces versus other visual objects? I behavioral tested and scanned 40 adult participants, measuring face and object recognition ability and brain responses to faces. I conducted effective connectivity analyses to determine the network topology of the full face-processing network (core and extended) during face, object, and place viewing at 3 levels of analysis. Finally these topologies were quantified using Graph Theoretical Metrics and Pattern Recognition analyses. The results show that as face recognition ability increases, the PCC and bilateral Amygdala become less hub-like within the network. Additionally, the vmPFC becomes an inter-modular hub as face recognition increases. Finally, superior face recognizers exhibit more unique network topologies during face viewing compared to object viewing, while average and low recognizers do not. These results show that not only do high performers have fewer and more direct connections, resulting in more compact network topologies, but also that these topologies are specific to viewing faces and not other visual categories. Further, high performers networks when viewing faces are organized differently than when viewing objects, but such is not the case for average or low recognizers. This research is the first of its kind to merge effective connectivity, graph theory, and pattern recognition to study individual differences in network topology.

This implies that geometrically similar structures of different sizes should fail at the same nominal stress.  However, this is not quite true in many cases because of the Size Effect, which may be understood as the dependence of the concrete structure on its characteristic dimension.  The actual concrete strength of relatively larger structural members may be significantly lower than that of the standard size.  By neglecting the Size Effect, predicted load capacity values become increasingly less conservative as a member size increases.  Also, very large structures such as dams, bridges, and foundations are too large and too strong to be tested at full scale in the laboratory.  In recent years, major advances have been made in understanding of scaling and Size Effect.  However, these advances remain only in the static domain (i.e., slow loading rates), and none of the previous studies have addressed the effect of higher loading rates or high-strength concrete (HSC) on the Size Effect.  Structural concrete can be subjected to high loading rates, such as those associated with impact and explosion incidents.  Such load conditions are generated by dropped objects, vehicle collision into structures, accidental industrial explosions, missile impacts, military explosions, etc.  The Size Effect in normal strength concrete (NSC) is a phenomenon explained by a combination of plasticity and fracture mechanics, and it is related to the energy balance during the damage/fracture process which causes a change in the mode of failure of the concrete member with the increase in its size, thus causing a reduction in its strength. Although structural response and damage evolution are expected to be size-dependent, it is not clear how time or the material strength affect this phenomenon.  In this study, the Size Effect phenomenon was investigated under compressive static and impact loads for both normal and high-strength concrete cylinders.  This study was conducted by performing 127 compressive static and impact tests on both normal and high-strength concrete and 192 numerical simulations. The tests provided data whose analysis produced evidence on the effect of loading rate and material strength on the Size Effect for structural concrete in compression. Parallel pre- and post-test computational simulations were used to perform \u2018numerical tests\u2019 of the same specimens, and to explore the role of the time dimension on the physical phenomena that contribute to the Size Effect. Comparisons between test and numerical data assisted and guided the investigators in identifying the governing parameters that define the physical phenomena. In addition, the precision test data assisted in validating the computational tools used for the study.  This thesis describes this multinational collaborative study (with experimental tests performed at three different locations: Penn State University, USA; the National Defense Academy, Japan; and the University of British Colombia, Canada), and it presents data from both the unique impact tests and the related numerical simulations. Two material models were developed to simulate the dynamic Size Effect that was proved to exist in this study.  The study also proved the existence of Size Effect in parameters other than strength such as the modulus of elasticity and the strain at maximum stress.  This necessitated modifying the existing Size Effect which was mainly confined to the strength parameter only.

These peptides are presented to antigen-specific CD8+ T cells on the appropriate MHC class I molecule by antigen-presenting cells (APC) that express the necessary costimulatory molecules.  Interfering with any of these steps can result in weaker or slower CD8+ T cell responses, thus impairing the ability of the host to control the growth and spread of a pathogen.\n\tDendritic cells (DC) are the most potent APC and are critical in the initiation of CD8+ T cell responses.  While neuroendocrine hormones, including stress-induced glucocorticoids (GC), have strong suppressive effects on T cell responses, it is not known whether these effects are mediated by direct effects on T cells themselves or occur indirectly via effects on the DC that are necessary for T cell activation.\n\tThe effects of stress-induced GC on DC function were investigated by treating murine DC with the rodent GC corticosterone (CORT) and determining the effects of CORT on the responses of DC to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  These studies found that CORT suppresses several components of the DC response to LPS, with effects on DC maturation, endocytosis, and cytokine production.  The net result of the effects of CORT on DC is that DC are rendered less efficient for T cell priming.\n\tThese studies were extended in vivo to determine the effects of stress on DC function during an HSV infection.  By using a model of restraint stress in which mice were subjected to stress during the earliest part of infection, we were able to determine the effects of stress on the first stages of the immune response and the consequences of these effects on the subsequent course of infection.  In these studies, we found that DC from infected mice were impaired in their ability to stimulate CD8+ T cells ex vivo, while the CD8+ T cell response was impaired in vivo.  These impairments were associated with increased viral loads, delayed viral clearance, and delayed resolution of viral lesions.  The effects of stress on the CD8+ T cell response are mediated by CORT because they can be blocked using a GC receptor (GR) antagonist.  Using a line of mice whose T cells do not express GR (GR-TKO), we were able to determine that CD8+ T cell responses are suppressed by the effects of stress-induced CORT on non-T cells.  The identity of these \u201cnon-T cells\u201d is likely to be DC, as they are impaired in stressed mice, critical for efficient T cell function, and susceptible to functional impairment by CORT.  \nThe findings presented in this dissertation underscore the central role that DC have in the generation of T cell responses and highlight the importance of DC as a target of neuroendocrine hormones during stress-induced immunosuppression.  Therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating T cell responses in stressed individuals must take into account the effects of neuroendocrine hormones on DC function to successfully overcome stress-induced immunosuppression.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4017], "author_name_tesi": "Elftman, Michael David", "last_name_ssi": "Elftman", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Mary E Truckenmiller", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Avery August", "Channe D Gowda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Harold Bonneau, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Chair", "Mary E Truckenmiller, Committee Chair", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Channe D Gowda, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dendritic cell", "psychological stress", "HSV"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Autoignition of Hydrogen and Syngas with Air in a Turbulent Flow Reactor", "id": "16294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7825", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A good deal of attention has been given recently to combustion of syngas in gas turbines used for power generation.  Syngas is a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced from coal gasification, a process where coal is partially oxidized producing a gaseous product with high concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.  Although coal gasification is not a new technology, recent interest has been spurred by concerns about climate change due in large part to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Coal-fired power plants in 2011 produced approximately 46% of the electricity used in the United States, but contributed 79% of the energy related carbon dioxide emissions.  The reason that coal contributes such a large portion of the carbon dioxide emissions is that the carbon to hydrogen ratio of coal is high as compared to other hydrocarbon fuels.  As a result, more of the energy released from burning coal comes from the oxidation of carbon rather than hydrogen, which increases the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per kilowatt hour.  To reduce these high carbon dioxide emissions, the use of syngas as fuel is part of the \"Clean Coal\" effort that will use carbon sequestration to remove carbon dioxide from the combustion products and store it underground.  \n\nOne of the challenges of using syngas as a fuel is the  variable composition in terms of the amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide present in the fuel.  This variable composition results from the wide variety of coal that can be used to produce syngas.  These compositional variations alter the combustion characteristics of syngas.  Additionally, present gas turbine technology for power generation utilizes lean-premixed conditions to reduce oxides of nitrogen formation, that is fuel and hot air from the compressor are premixed prior to combustion.  If premixed syngas and air was to ignite in the gas turbine premixer, severe damage would occur.  Consequently, one of the combustion characteristics of particular importance is the autoignition time.  Autoignition is a measure of the time for a mixture of fuel and oxidizer at some elevated temperature to spontaneously ignite.  Thus, the present study specifically addresses measurements of the autoignition time for hydrogen and hydrogen/carbon monoxide mixtures under conditions relevant to gas turbines used for power generation.\n\nExperiments were conducted using a turbulent flow reactor for the purpose of examining autoignition times for hydrogen and hydrogen/carbon monoxide mixtures with air.  Experiments with only hydrogen as fuel were conducted at experimental conditions including ignition delay times of 130 and 210 ms, equivalence ratios of 0.375 and 0.750, and pressures of 10 and 15 atm.  Temperatures could be varied between 800 and 900 K using a combination of an electric heater and a hydrogen and oxygen fueled preburner.  Experiments were also conducted with a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, to simulate Syngas, at a pressure of 15 atm, an ignition delay time of 130 ms, and at equivalence ratios 0.375 and 0.75.  \n\nThe temperatures that resulted in autoigntion of hydrogen at the above conditions ranged between 840 to 890 K.  The temperatures that resulted in autoignition for the syngas experiments were 8 to 23 K lower than those observed for hydrogen at the same pressure and equivalence ratio conditions.  Previous experiments conducted at similar conditions using hydrogen and hydrogen/carbon monoxide mixtures in turbulent flow reactors reported much shorter autoignition times.  Furthermore, these earlier studies showed significant disparities, as much as 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, between predictions of autoignition using homogeneous chemical kinetic models and measurements of autoignition time.  The results of the current study show agreement with the homogeneous chemical kinetics model within at most a factor of five.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7757], "author_name_tesi": "Elies, Daniel Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Elies", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["autoignition", "flow reactor", "syngas", "hydrogen", "premixed", "ignition delay"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE RELATIONSHIP OF PERFECTIONISM TO ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, SELF-ESTEEM, DEPRESSION, AND RACIAL IDENTITY IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS ATTENDING PREDOMINANTLY WHITE UNIVERSITIES\n", "id": "7465", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis study examined 253 African American college students on the constructs of perfectionism, academic achievement, self-esteem, depression, and racial identity.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2006-07, however, shows that not all workers receive employer directed training. According to BLS data, as the size of businesses decrease the likelihood of employer directed training also decreases. Following this data, approximately 53 million Americans do not receive employer directed training (undirected workers). \nThis study explored the problem of how undirected workers learn these critical non-technical skills when employee directed training is not forthcoming. A qualitative, grounded study methodology was used. Eleven cosmetologists employed by independently owned salons located in various cities and towns in Pennsylvania composed the study sample. Data consisted of participant interviews with a focus on career development and experiences, salon industry learning artifacts and national statistics, and the investigator\u2019s extensive experience as a cosmetologist. Researcher bias was an ongoing concern throughout the investigation and steps were taken accordingly.\n\tFindings show undirected workers learn non-technical skills in the same way they learn technical skills, through informal learning experiences afforded them via social practices and activities that are common to the workers both inside and outside of the work situation. However, although participants were keenly aware of how they were learning technical skills, they did not connect this same process with learning non-technical skills. The findings suggest that these professionals have devalued non-technical skills to the point of disavowing them as learnable professional tools. These same participants unanimously identified advanced non-technical skills as more important than advanced technical skills for success in their industry. \n\tThe importance of non-technical skills must be communicated to all workers, not just those who receive employer-directed training. New methods to communicate this information are needed as well as new methods for delivery that can accommodate the situation of non-directing businesses. These new methods would positively affect, according to the BLS (2006-07), at least half of the American workforce employed by privately owned businesses, making them more productive, increasing their potential income, and improving their lives and the lives of their families. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1934], "author_name_tesi": "Elliott, Franklin Eugene", "last_name_ssi": "Elliott", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugene", "first_name_ssi": "Franklin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Ann Kolb", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Richard Allen Walter", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Richard Allen Walter, Committee Chair", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Workforce Education", "Non-technical Skills", "Informal Learning", "Soft Skills", "Career and Technical"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Combining Radar and Aircraft Observations to Investigate the Kinematic and Microphysical Properties of the 20 May 2011 Squall Line", "id": "8910jt56k", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12431", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        Little is known about the microphysical structure of squall line precipitation in the mid and upper levels of the troposphere.  With the evolution of dual-frequency approaches and dual-polarization radar data, an assessment of the microphysical properties above the melting layer has become feasible.  A greater knowledge of the microphysical processes present in midlatitude, continental squall lines will allow cloud modelers to better represent these processes in numerical simulations.  Conventional and dual-polarization radar data collected during the Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) are analyzed in order to assess the evolution of the squall line that progressed across the Southern Great Plains on 20 May 2011.  Thermodynamic and microphysical observations collected by the University of North Dakota (UND) Citation aircraft complement the radar analyses and allow for an assessment of the rear inflow jet\u2019s effects on the storm, particularly its microphysical structure.  \n        Dual-polarization radar measurements of co-polar correlation coefficient (CC) values between 0.6 and 0.8 signify the presence of the melting layer between 3 and 4 km above ground level.  These low values indicate a mixture of melting snowflakes and completely melted liquid drops within the layer.  C- and Ka-band dual-wavelength ratios (DWRC,Ka) in the 3-5 dB range indicate the presence of ice crystal aggregates within the 3.5 \u2013 5.5 km layer.  Downward-relative radar reflectivity factor (Z) gradients < 5 dB km-1 near the -15 \u00b0C level argue against the presence of dendritic crystal growth.  In-situ cloud particle images further suggest the absence of dendritic growth.  Only small, roundish particles and a few aggregates appear in Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) imagery, suggesting that vigorous vapor diffusional growth of crystals into nonspherical shapes was not present.  Relative humidity values well below 100% with respect to ice in the ice-phase layer of the storm suggest sublimation, which can explain the hydrometeors\u2019 roundish appearances.  Near the back edge of the stratiform precipitation, westerly storm-relative zonal wind speeds as great as 15 m s-1 at mid-levels inject dry, ambient air into the storm.  The appearance of this rear inflow jet is coincident with decreases in the relative humidity with respect to ice of an additional 10-30% and leads to an enhancement in sublimation.  As a result of the sublimation, mid-level temperatures drop 1-3 \u00b0C.  Because all but aggregational growth is inhibited in subsaturated conditions, particle size and number concentrations drop dramatically and lead to an erosion of radar precipitation echoes.

However, as a result of historical European activities, especially milldam construction and the deposition of several meters of fine-grained sediments on the regional landscape, stream geomorphology and riparian vegetation have been significantly modified. The once-broad wetlands were converted into incised, meandering streams with nearly vertical, unstable banks that are currently contributing large quantities of nutrient-rich sediment downstream. Denlingers Mill, in southeastern Pennsylvania, is one of many derelict milldam sites composed of an altered, incised stream with a narrow terrace floodplain. However, this site is unusual compared to other previously studied legacy sediment sites because it has exposed bedrock slopes that support a modern secondary riparian forest adjacent to the stream, presumably growing atop the same substrate that the pre-settlement forest once did. The exceptionally prolific subfossil leaf mats at this site were deposited as the large, overhanging trees of the old-growth forest contributed prodigious quantities of leaves into the stream, similarly to the secondary forest today. Therefore, the leaf macrofossils from this site provide both a strong, novel, non-wetland signal, and an opportunity to directly compare the old-growth pre-settlement forest composition with the altered secondary forest. Very few Holocene paleoecological studies are based on leaves, opting instead for fruits, seeds, wood, or pollen, but due to their fragility and inability to be reworked, macrofossil leaves can supply local information not available from these other sources. The Denlingers Mill subfossil leaf assemblage, removed from a stream cutbank within an organic-rich hydric soil immediately underlying historical sediments, contains representative species from at least three different pre-colonial plant communities, including a novel non-wetland and upland hardwood forest assemblage supplied by the unusual upland slope areas at Denlingers Mill. Leaves and some fruits and seeds were cleaned of all siliciclastic and organic debris, and mounted on glass slides for identification. A total of eleven species or morphotypes were identified in the subfossil assemblage. Although the majority of the assemblage consists of facultative upland species, particularly American beech (Fagus grandifolia), sweet birch (Betula lenta), and species of red and white oak (Quercus spp.), some facultative wetland species such as willow (Salix sp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), and black ash (Fraxinus nigra) are also present. Integrating these results with previous studies, the pre-settlement landscape probably consisted of a suite of distinct communities with a continuum of overlapping species, namely a tussock sedge marshland in valley-bottoms, a transitional lowland red maple-black ash forested swamp, and a red oak-beech mixed hardwood forest on slopes and upland areas. When compared to the modern successional forest at Denlingers Mill, dominated by box elder (Acer negundo) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum), it is apparent that post-settlement riparian forests in the region have been significantly modified as a result of European colonization. Furthermore, this illustrates that, in addition to the loss of valley-bottom wetlands due mainly to milldam construction, another important aspect of colonial landscape alteration is the loss of riparian and slope old- growth forests attributable instead to deforestation and agriculture. Riparian vegetation influences fluvial hydrology, geomorphology, and channel bank stability. Therefore, successful restoration including the reestablishment of stream-accessible floodplains, and the creation of self-sustaining riparian buffer flora to reduce erosion and nutrient loading downstream, necessitates an understanding of the pre-European settlement plant communities, which can be greatly improved by incorporating leaf macrofossil studies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7777], "author_name_tesi": "Elliott, Sara Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Elliott", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Sara", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plant Macrofossils", "Piedmont", "Stream Restoration", "Paleontology", "Paleoecology"]}]
