Current state-of-the-art accelerators based on conventional radio-frequency (rf) cavities are too large and expensive for widespread commercial use, and alternative designs must be considered for supplying relativistic beams to small-scale applications, including medical imaging, security screening, and scientific research in a university-scale laboratory. Laser-driven acceleration using micro-fabricated dielectric photonic structures is an attractive approach because such photonic microstructures can support accelerating fields that are 10 to 100 times higher than that of rf cavity-based accelerators. Dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) use commercial lasers as a driving source, which are smaller and less expensive than the klystrons used to drive current rf-based accelerators. Despite the apparent need for compact and economical laser sources for laser-driven acceleration, the availability of suitable high-peak-power lasers that cover a broad spectral range is currently limited.\nTo address the needs of several innovative acceleration mechanisms like DLA, it is proposed to develop a coherent source of mid-infrared (IR) electromagnetic radiation that can be implemented as a driving source of laser accelerators. The use of ultrashort mid-IR high peak power laser systems in various laser-driven acceleration schemes has shown the potential to greatly reduce the optical pump intensities needed to realize high acceleration gradients. The optical intensity needed to achieve a given ponderomotive potential is 25 times less when using a 5-\u00b5m mid-IR laser as compared to using a 1-\u00b5m near-IR solid-state laser. In addition, dielectric structure breakdown caused by multiphoton ionization can be avoided by using longer-wavelength driving lasers. Current mid-IR laser sources do not produce sufficiently short pulse durations, broad spectral bandwidths, or high energies as required by certain accelerator applications. The use of a high- peak-power mid-IR laser system in DLA could enable tabletop accelerators on the MeV to GeV scale for security scanners, medical therapy devices, and compact x-ray light sources.\nUltrashort mid-IR laser sources also play a vital role in the measurement and enhancement of material properties relevant for nuclear applications. For example, photoexcitation of graphene with femtosecond mid-IR laser pulses can be used to measure the time-resolved photoconductivity in graphene for its use in radiation detection. Graphene photodetectors have the unique ability to operate at room temperatures across a broad spectral region with ultrashort response times; however, achieving high efficiency in graphene detectors remains challenging due to graphene\u2019s weak optical absorption. The current methods and materials are not capable of operating at room temperature, do not respond at mid-IR wavelengths, or cannot achieve single-shot operation. Therefore, the metrology of ultrashort mid-IR laser pulses is needed to understand the mechanisms of photoconductive gain in mid-IR detectors to enhance detector efficiency. Advanced pulse diagnostic instrumentation is needed that performs reliably and efficiently over a broad spectral range for the metrology of ultrashort mid-IR laser pulses for applications of radiation detection, IR spectroscopy, and remote sensing for trace gas detection.\nThis dissertation reports on the design and construction of a simple and robust, short-pulse parametric source operating at a center wavelength of 5 \u00b5m. The design and construction of a high-energy, short-pulse 2-\u00b5m parametric source is also presented, which serves as a surrogate pumping source for the 5-\u00b5m source. An elegant method for mid-IR pulse characterization is demonstrated, which makes use of ubiquitous silicon photodetectors, traditionally reserved for the characterization of near-IR radiation. In addition, a dual-chirped parametric amplification technique is extended into the mid-IR spectral region, producing a bandwidth- tunable mid-IR source in a simple design without sacrificing conversion efficiency. The design and development of a compact single-shot mid-IR prism spectrometer is also reported, and its implementation in a number of condensed matter studies at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is discussed. Rapid tuning and optimization of a high-energy parametric laser system using the mid-IR spectrometer is demonstrated, which significantly enhances the capabilities of performing optical measurements on superconducting materials using the LCLS instrument. All of the laser sources and optical technologies presented in this dissertation were developed using relatively simple designs to provide compact and cost-effective systems to address some of the challenges facing accelerator and IR spectroscopy technologies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12012], "author_name_tesi": "Wandel, Scott Franklin", "last_name_ssi": "Wandel", "middle_name_ssi": "Franklin", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic", "Igor Jovanovic", "Marek Flaska", "Michael Tonks", "Timothy Joseph Kane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic, Dissertation Advisor", "Igor Jovanovic, Committee Chair", "Marek Flaska, Committee Member", "Michael Tonks, Committee Member", "Timothy Joseph Kane, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optical parametric amplification", "Mid-infrared", "Nonlinear optics", "Pulse shaping", "Dielectric laser acceleration", "Prism spectrometer"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Motion Monitor for movement in MRI using reflective marker, optical fibers and webcam", "id": "23349", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging technique used as a research modality for the study of human anatomy. Patient motion during MRI scanning remains a severe problem which degrades the diagnostic accuracy, posing significant problems in the acquisition and analysis of the MRI data. In this thesis, three algorithms were explored for real time motion detection of head movement in patients. The current motion detection methods are expensive and, to a degree, scanner specific making it problematic for inclusion in every scanner. The proposed research is a potential alternative, as it is scanner independent and based on low cost hardware namely webcam, non-coherent optical fiber bundles, reflective marker and a personal computer. One end of the optical fiber bundle is above the reflective marker placed on the head of patient and the other end is connected to the webcam. The proposed algorithms use the red, green and blue channels of the color of light emerging from the output end of the optical fiber bundle to determine the range of movement. Bench testing demonstrated that two of the algorithms seemed to have some shortcomings to be usable at this time. The third algorithm passed the bench tests outside the scanner for head-foot linear movement (like straightening of a body when lying on MRI table) and roll rotational movement (like shaking of the head for a no). Head-foot linear movement and pitch rotational movement (like nodding of the head for a yes) were varied to some degrees during calibration inside the scanner. To evaluate the effects of the movements on the resulting MRI images, MRI scan was taken to acquire images with motion. A simulation analysis was performed on an MRI image dataset obtained from internet. The results of the simulation were compared with the results of the images with motion acquired in the MRI scan.\nThe tests demonstrated that motion monitor was able to detect movements as small as 2.5 mm and 1 degree for the head-foot and roll movements respectively. A feedback system can be developed to inform the patients of movement which will help the patients to remain still during the MRI scan.

The turbulent fluctuations of temperature and chemical species concentrations have strong effects on radiative intensities, and turbulence-radiation interactions (TRI) create a \"closure\" problem when the governing partial differential equations are averaged. To avoid this problem, TRI effects are completely neglected in traditional combustion calculations. This has been shown to yield huge errors in the estimation of radiative fluxes. In the recent one or two decades,\nseveral approaches have been proposed to take TRI into account. However, virtually all of them have adopted an optically-thin fluctuation approximation to neglect the nonlinear coupling between turbulence and absorption: the so-called \"absorption TRI.\"\nTherefore, the above problem has not been completely solved. Among those attempts, the most promising approaches are joint-probability-density-function (joint-PDF) methods, which can treat the nonlinear coupling between turbulence and emission exactly: the so-called \"emission-TRI.\" The aim of the present thesis is to extend joint PDF methods to take TRI fully into account and validate the widely adopted optically-thin fluctuation approximation in various turbulent flames.\n\nThe idea of joint-PDF methods is to treat physical variables as random variables and to solve the joint-PDF transport equation by stochastic methods, in which the actual flow is represented by a large number of stochastic particles carrying their own random variable values and evolving with time. Since each particle is one realization of the joint-PDF, the mean value of any function of those random variables only, such as the chemical source term, can be evaluated exactly by taking the ensemble of particles. The local emission term belongs to this category and, thus, can be evaluated exactly and directly from the particle ensemble. However, the local absorption term involves interactions between the local particle and the energy emitted by all other particles, and can not be obtained from the particle ensemble directly. To solve this problem, a photon Monte Carlo method is proposed in the present thesis to evaluate such interactions, so that the absorption term can be evaluated exactly.\n\nIn the present study a composition-PDF approach is employed, in which only temperature and species concentrations are treated as random variables. Meanwhile, a hybrid finite-volume/Monte Carlo\nscheme is adopted, in which the finite-volume method is used to solve for the flow field and the Monte Carlo method is used to solve for the composition joint-PDF for chemical reactions and radiation as\ndiscussed earlier. To implement the photon Monte Carlo method in the PDF particle field, special schemes are developed since traditional photon Monte Carlo simulations were developed for continuum media. An adaptive emission scheme is proposed to minimize statistical errors of the photon Monte Carlo method, considering that the particle emission energy may vary several orders of magnitude due to the high inhomogeneity of gases in turbulent flames. The absorption simulation requires that an optical thickness be assigned to each of the particles. Two approaches are discussed, the Point Particle Model (PPM), in which the shape of the particle is not specified, and the Spherical Particle Model (SPM) in which particles are assumed to be spheres with constant radiation properties. Another issue for absorption schemes in particle fields is the influence region of a ray. Two ways of modeling a ray are proposed. In the first, each ray is treated as a standard volume-less line. In the other approach, the ray is assigned a small solid angle, and is thus treated as a cone with a decaying influence function away from its center line. Based on these models, three different interaction schemes between rays and particles are proposed, i.e., Line-SPM, Cone-PPM and Cone-SPM methods.\n\nThe spectral modeling is important for radiation applications involving participating media. Two approaches for spectral modeling, the line-by-line and full-spectrum k-distribution methods, are developed and compared for general photon Monte Carlo simulations in both continuum media and particle fields. For line-by-line calculations the\nhigh-resolution absorption coefficient data are generated for important combustion gases. Based on these data, a high-accuracy compact narrow-band k-distribution database is constructed, from\nwhich full-spectrum k-distributions can be efficiently assembled. The random number relations have also been constructed for both spectral\nmodels. Although the full-spectrum k-distribution approach is extremely efficient in deterministic solvers for the radiative transfer equation, this\nadvantage is not prominent for photon Monte Carlo solvers. Since the full-spectrum k-distribution approach results in inevitable errors due to the uncorrelatedness of absorption coefficients in combustion gases while the line-by-line approach\nis exact, the line-by-line approach is more preferable for photon Monte Carlo simulations in\ncombustion applications.\n\nTRI effects have been fully taken into account in the investigation of radiative transfer in several turbulent jet flames, including nonluminous flames, such as the Sandia Flame D, artificial flames derived from Flame D, and sooting flames. The effects of different TRI components are investigated. In the nonluminous flames considered in this thesis, it is shown that, to predict the radiation field accurately, emission TRI must be taken into account,\nwhile, as expected, absorption TRI is negligible if the total radiation quantities are concerned, but non-negligible for evaluation of local quantities. Generally, the presence of soot greatly increases the optical thickness of flames. As a result, TRI\neffects are more prominent in sooting flames, as shown in the study of an ethylene flame and its enlarged flame. In the ethylene flame, TRI effects on the temperature distribution are more prominent\nthan in the nonluminous flames. Once again, emission TRI can not be neglected, while the importance of absorption TRI is still minor for overall radiation quantities, though non-negligible for local\nquantities. This implies that it is still an optically thin flame. However, in optically thick flames, such as the enlarged ethylene flame under investigation, absorption TRI has substantial\neffects on the flame structure and radiation calculations, and the optically-thin fluctuation approximation is invalid. Strong effects of soot on radiation are also demonstrated, which necessitate a more advanced soot model in future research.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [449], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Anquan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anquan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael F Modest", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Paul E Plassmann", "Philip John Morris", "Deborah A Levin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael F Modest, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Paul E Plassmann, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gas radiative properties", "flame", "turbulence-radiation interactions", "combustion", "thermal radiation", "composition PDF", "Monte Carlo methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL STIMULI ON MICROSTRUCTURE-PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP AT THE NANOSCALE", "id": "14328bzw127", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to their small physical and microstructural size, nanoscale materials show significantly different behavior compared to the bulk. Size effects studies on materials behavior, particularly at the nanoscale, has been a vigorously active area of research. The state of art is to characterize materials properties at individual domains, such as mechanical, electrical and thermal. Fundamental aspects of microstructure-properties relationship in these individual domains are relatively well understood. Nevertheless, experiments relating external stimuli, such as stress, temperature, electrical current, light, ion irradiation to structure and properties at the nanoscale remain challenging at this length-scale. From a fundamental perspective, small size should make materials more sensitive to stimuli compared to bulk. If this hypothesis is validated, one can envision facile tuning of microstructure to actively control materials properties. Such tunability would enhance performance in broader areas of electronics, energy conversion and sensors. This motivates us to experimentally investigate the stimuli-microstructure-property relationship at the nanoscale.\nThe technical contribution of this research is a unique nanofabricated experimental setup that integrates nanoscale specimens with tools for interrogating mechanical (stress-strain, fracture, and fatigue), thermal and electrical (conductivity) properties as function of external stimuli such as strain, temperature, electrical field and radiation. It addresses the shortcomings of the state of the art characterization techniques, which are yet to perform such simultaneous and multi-domain measurements. Our technique has virtually no restriction on specimen material type and thickness, which makes the setup versatile. It is demonstrated with 100 nm thick nickel, aluminum, zirconium; 25 nm thick molybdenum di-sulphide (MoS2), 10 nm hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) specimens and 100nm carbon nanofiber, all in freestanding thin film form. The technique is compatible with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In-situ TEM captures microstructural features, (defects, phases, precipitates and interfaces), diffraction patterns and chemical microanalysis in real time. \u2018Seeing the microstructure while measuring properties\u2019 is our unique capability. It helps identifying fundamental mechanisms behind thermo-electro-mechanical coupling and degradation, so that these mechanisms can be used to (i) explain the results obtained for mesoscale specimens of the same materials and experimental conditions and (ii) develop computational models to explain and predict properties at both nano and meso scales. The uniqueness of this contribution is therefore simultaneously quantitative and qualitative probing of length-scale dependent external stimuli effects on microstructures and physical properties of nanoscale materials.\nThe scientific contribution of this research is the experimental validation of the fundamental hypothesis that, if the nanoscale size can cause significant deviation in a certain domain, e.g., mechanical, it can also make that domain more sensitive to external stimuli when compared to bulk. We have showed that mechanical properties of freestanding nanocrystalline thin films have higher sensitivity to elevated temperatures compared to bulk. The Young\u2019s modulus of nanocrystalline aluminum thin film is measured about 50% of the room temperature value at 65% of the melting temperature. The higher volume fraction of grain boundaries can be ascribed to this observation since the inherent disorder on the grain boundary atoms means they are more sensitive to the temperature. At the bulk scale, thermal conductivity of metals is not sensitive to mechanical strain. However, this may not be true for grain sizes below the electron mean free paths, for which mechanical deformation mechanism and volume fraction of grain boundaries are drastically different from the bulk. Our experimental results show strong mechanical strain-thermal conductivity coupling, thermal conductivity of Zr film with average grain size of 10nm dropped from 20 W/m-K to 13 W/m-K with a strain level of only 1.24 %.  \nIn this dissertation, we present a series of studies tied by the common thread of synergy of two or more stimuli. The first example is on pure metals, which need very high temperature (> 0.5Tm, where Tm is melting point) or stress (>\u03c3y, where \u03c3y is the yield stress) to change microstructure. In contrast, we present experimental evidence of about 100 times grain growth in nanocrystalline nickel at only 0.2Tm (Tm is the melting temperature) when accompanied with only 0.2\u03c3y (\u03c3y is the yield stress) stress. This finding contradicts with the classical understanding that grain growth is a plastic deformation (>\u03c3y) mechanism. Interestingly, stressing the films by high stress (around \u03c3y) or temperature (0.5Tm) separately produce only insignificant grain growth. These results suggest that when synergistic, external stimuli can exert unprecedented influence over microstructure-properties in nanoscale materials. In a corollary study, we modeled nanocrystalline metals as a standard linear elastic solid and our experimental results on 100 nm thick (average grain size 10 nm) freestanding nickel specimens at temperatures from 300 to 425 \u00b0K support this hypothesis reasonably well.  The viscosity of solid nickel ranged from 3.3x1013 Pa.s to 1.5x1013 Pa.s at these temperatures, which are about two orders of magnitude smaller than that expected for metals and are also less sensitive to temperature compared to bulk. \nThe second case study involved a novel concept of electro-graphitization that induces synergistic thermo-electro-mechanical fields to graphitize carbon nanofibers at around 800 \u00baC temperature and below 106 A/cm2 current density. In comparison, conventional graphitization of carbon nanofiber requires very high temperatures (> 2800 \u00b0C). A more convincing study on the pronounced role of stimuli on microstructure-properties is the transformation of amorphous materials to nano or microcrystalline form. This is because typically the energy barrier for this kind of transformation is very high, requiring extreme conditions to initiate such transformation. To pursue this, we studied 25 nm thick MoS2 and 10 nm h-BN films. Our in-situ TEM heating of these specimens indicated that such phase transformation can be induced to temperatures as low as 600 \u00b0C. \nIn the third study, we observed anomalous response of GaN microstructure to the externally applied electrical field at nanoscale. 90\u00ba domain switching in 100nm thick GaN film was observed at a 107 V/m electrical field, applied perpendicular to the polarization direction. No such switching was observed for thicker films. This anomalous behavior is explained by the nanoscale size effects on the piezoelectric coefficients of GaN, which can be 2-3 times larger than the bulk value. \nWe also explored the sensitivity of nanoscale materials to photons and ions. With light radiation on monolayer MoS2 films, we observed very strong light-matter interaction (photo voltaic effects) without any apparent rectifying junctions. For bi-layers, no such effect was present, suggesting strong size effect in light-matter interaction. The photo-voltaic effect was observed to highly direction dependent in the film plane, which suggests that the oblique deposition configuration plays a key role in developing the rectifying potential gradient. We have studied ion irradiation effects in Zr thin films, showing significant grain growth (>300%), texture evolution, and displacement damage defects. Stress-strain profiles were mostly linear elastic below 20 nm grain size, but above this limit the samples demonstrated yielding and strain hardening. Experimental results support the hypothesis that grain boundaries in nanocrystalline metals act as very effective defect sinks.\nSince microstructures-properties in nanoscale are sensitive to external stimuli, structural stability or degradation of nanoscale materials due to over stimuli will be an important topic to study. To pursue this, we studied the degradation mechanism of graphene and WSe2/graphene heterostructure as a function of temperature and electrical current density. Our experimental results show that high temperature and current density can induce migration of foreign contaminants due to phenomena similar to thermo and electromigration and alloying with foreign elements leads to catastrophic degradation in crystallinity.\nThis dissertation presents experimental evidence of external stimuli effects on the microstructures-properties relationship at nanoscale. The technological aspect of this research impacts nanotechnology applications, like microelectronics, optoelectronics, energy conversion and sensors. However, it is also very fundamental in nature, and the new phenomena that are explored will enrich knowledge of material behavior and lay foundation for the future work on multi-physics of material at nanoscale.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15239], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Baoming ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "first_name_ssi": "Baoming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Md Amanul Haque", "Donghai Wang", "Reuben H Kraft", "Douglas Edward Wolfe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Dissertation Advisor", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Chair", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Reuben H Kraft, Committee Member", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEMS", "TEM", "Stimuli", "Microstructure", "Nanoscale", "Size Effect", "Mechanical", "Thermal", "Electrical", "Multiphysics", "Coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Graphene and graphene fluoride: synthesis, properties and applications", "id": "16009", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7159", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the properties and applications of graphene and graphene fluoride at the junction of physics, material science and electronics. We study the synthesis and characterization of these two novel carbon nanomaterials, and their potential applications in biochemical sensing and optoelectronics.\nWe start with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of large-scale single-layer graphene sheets, followed by material characterization and device fabrication. We   demonstrate bio-sensor arrays based on ion-sensitive graphene field-effect transistors (ISGFETs). The ISGFETs are capable of operating in solution environment and show typical carrier mobilities around 5000 cm2/Vs for both electrons and holes. A pulsing gate technique is employed to suppress the hysteresis present in GFETs. Using a SiO2 layer as sensing surface, pH measurement with an average sensitivity of 46 mV/pH is achieved. The pH sensing mechanism of ISGFETs can be explained by a site-dissociation model. We further demonstrate the functionalization of the SiO2 surface with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS). Preliminary studies of DNA hybridization show the promise of the ISGFETs as biosensors.\nBand gap engineering of graphene is a potential way to extend its applications to optoelectronics. We explore a chemical approach to open a band gap in graphene using fluorination. Thermal fluorination of bulk graphite yields a stoichiometric chemical derivative, (CF)n. Photoluminescence from (CF)n with laser energies up to 5.08 eV is studied at a wide range of temperatures and reveals its six emission modes. The lineshape of these emission modes implies that they are associated with mid-gap states related to defects, possibly fluorine deficient sites. The band gap of (CF)n is likely beyond the highest excitation energy employed, which suggests that it is a wide gap insulator.\nPartial fluorination is studied to achieve a reduced band gap. We employ CF4 plasma to treat  CVD graphene sheets. The fluorine-containing radicals react with graphene to form CFx (x = 1, 2, 3) functional groups. As plasma time or power increases, CFx shifts to larger x components and eventually turns into CF4 gas molecules. We find that the transport behavior in this regime is dominated by the inhomogeneity of fluorination, which is related with the structural features of CVD graphene, i.e.. multi-layer patches, folds and wrinkles. Tunneling current from fluorinated graphene is shown to decrease drastically as fluorination time increases, which is consistent with the increase of the band gap. We observe that at lower fluorination ratio, the tunneling current can be explained by the Poole-Frenkel mechanism. The results of our studies suggest a way to achieve carbon based two dimensional semiconductors for both fundamental research and applications.\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7146], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Bei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Zhu", "Jun Zhu", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene", "graphene fluoride", "GFET"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Femtosecond Laser Enabled Maskless Nanostructure Fabrications and Applications", "id": "24830", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11005", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Femtosecond laser ablation is quite different when compared to other laser ablation methods due to the ultra-short pulse duration.

Backfill materials should be adequately compacted to lock the pipe in place and reduce potential settlement from external loading (e.g., traffic loading).  On the other hand, excessive backfill compaction from compaction equipment may damage the pipe.  Backhoe-mounted hydraulic plate compactors (hoe-packs) have been increasingly used for soil compaction in trenching, street repairing, or site preparations.  Comparing to traditional compaction tools such as roller compactors, hoe-packs are advantageous for utility trench backfill compaction as they can be operated by the backhoe operator and requires no lifting of compaction machine during compaction process.  However, uncertainty remains with regard to the maximum lift thickness to consistently achieve desired compacted dry mass density by hydraulic plate compactors.  The large impulse energy and down pressure exerted by hydraulic plate compactors also raise concerns on potential damages to utility pipes.  \n\tThe objective of this study is to assess the capability of a hoe-pack for utility trench backfill compaction.  Field tests were conducted to investigate the effect of hoe-pack on compacted dry mass density, compaction-induced earth pressures, and compaction-induced strains in pipe.  Different values of lift thickness and pipe materials were used.  Compaction tests using hand-held vibratory roller compactors which followed the specifications of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) were conducted as a control set.  It is concluded that the hoe-pack used in this study can consistently achieve relative densities above 100% of the Standard Proctor Density (SPD) with a lift thickness of 8 inches or 12 inches.  However, the hoe-pack is not able to consistently achieve relative densities above 100% of SPD 12 inches below the compacted surface when the lift thickness is 18 inches or greater.  Comparing the performances of the hoe-pack and vibratory roller compactor used in this study for a lift thickness of 8 inches, the hoe-pack is more efficient in performing compaction.  The hoe-pack used in this study is likely to induce higher dynamic earth pressures in the backfill  \nzone, but may not induce higher static earth pressures depending on the pipe material and diameter.  The hoe-pack used in this study generally induces similar strains along pipe as the vibratory roller compactor does.  For the hoe-pack used in this study, the static earth pressures in the backfill zone are relatively insensitive to lift thickness, whereas the dynamic earth pressures may decrease as the lift thickness increases, depending on the pipe.  The effect of lift thickness on strains developed along pipe also depends on the pipe.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10765], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Chaoyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chaoyi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tong Qiu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tong Qiu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Compaction", "Pipe", "Hoe-pack", "Soil"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "THE INSTRUCTIONAL EFFECTS OF PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND THREE CONCEPT MAPPING STRATEGIES IN FACILITATING ACHIEVEMENT OF DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES \n\n\n\n", "id": "6098", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n<br><br>The purpose of this study was to explore the instructional effects of prior knowledge and three concept mapping strategies in facilitating achievement of different educational objectives.

The prior knowledge levels of the subjects were identified through a general physiology test. Achievement was measured by the identification, terminology, and comprehension tests and the total test.

The experiment was conducted in a web-enhanced learning environment. The subjects browsed the given study website, interacted with the online learning material, and then, took the three criterion tests online and submitted the test results.

Phosphonate and phosphinate compounds can potently inhibit enzymes in various metabolic pathways by functioning as stable mimics of phosphate esters and carboxylic acids. Biosynthetic pathways to phosphonate and phosphinate compounds have proven to be treasure troves for the discovery of unusual enzymatic reactions. The investigation of these conserved pathways has revealed three unprecedented biochemical steps catalyzed by the non-heme-iron(II) enzymes, HppE [(S)-2-hydroxypropyl-1-phosphonate epoxidase], HEPD (2-hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase) and MPnS (methylphosphonate synthase). The work described herein focused on understanding both the mechanisms of the individual reactions and the structural/functional features of each enzyme important in specifying its reaction and pathway.\nThe iron-dependent epoxidase, HppE, converts (S)-2-hydroxypropyl-1-phosphonate (S-HPP) to the antibiotic, fosfomycin [(1R, 2S)-epoxypropylphosphonate], in an unusual 1,3-dehydrogenation of a secondary alcohol to an epoxide. HppE had been classified as an oxidase, with proposed mechanisms differing primarily in the identity of the O2-derived iron complex that abstracts hydrogen (H\u2022) from C1 of S-HPP to initiate epoxide ring closure. In my work, we showed that the preferred co-substrate is actually H2O2 and that HppE therefore almost certainly employs an iron(IV)-oxo complex as the H\u2022 abstractor. Reaction with H2O2 is accelerated by bound substrate and produces fosfomycin catalytically with a stoichiometry of unity. The ability of catalase to suppress the HppE activity previously attributed to its direct utilization of O2 showed that reduction of O2 and utilization of the resultant H2O2 were actually operant.\nThe mechanism of the conversion of 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate to hydroxymethylphosphonate (2-HEP) catalyzed by iron-dependent enzyme, HEPD during the biosynthesis of the commercial herbicide, phosphinothricin, had been enigmatic. By using rapid-kinetic and spectroscopic methods, we detected an iron(IV)-oxo (ferryl) intermediate in the HEPD reaction. Kinetic analysis suggested that the intermediate is kinetically competent to be on the productive pathway. The accumulation of this intermediate only with substrate having deuterium in the abstracted pro-S position of C2 of 2-HEP implied that the ferryl intermediate abstracts this hydrogen, but the increased accumulation of the ferryl complex in 2H2O solvent implied that the hydrogen becomes solvent-exchangeable before the ferryl abstracts it.  To account for these unanticipated results, a mechanism involving initial abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen by an Fe(III)-superoxo precursor to the ferryl complex, transfer of a hydroxyl group containing the originally abstracted hydrogen to C2 concomitant with formation of the ferryl complex, and an unprecedented abstraction of H\u2022 from the newly installed C2 OH group by the ferryl complex was proposed.\nLike HEPD, the iron-dependent oxygenase, MPnS, also catalyzes the 4e--oxidative C-C cleavage of 2-HEP, but generates different products, methylphosphonate and CO2. MPnS, HEPD, and HppE have quite striking structural similarity and utilize identical or similar phosphonate substrates, but they employ different oxidants, O2 or H2O2, to effect three completely different reactions. By using H2O2, HppE effects a 2e- oxidation (epoxide installing 1,3-dehydrogenation) of S-HPP. HEPD and MPnS catalyze distinct 4e--oxidative C1-C2-cleaving transformations of 2-HEP, in each case with O2 as the oxidant. We explored the distinct but potentially overlapping catalytic capabilities of the three enzymes on the two different phosphonate substrates with the two different oxidants. As expected from its reassignment as a peroxidase, HppE fails to catalyze a 4e--oxidative C-C cleavage reaction with O2 as oxidant. However, we found that both MPnS and HEPD can catalyze the 2e- dehydrogenation of 2-HEP with H2O2 rather than O2 as the oxidant. HEPD catalyzed only a fraction of a turnover under the conditions examined, consistent with the fact that it is an oxygenase. By contrast, MPnS, also a known oxygenase, surprisingly catalyzed up to 25 turnovers of 2-HEP to the corresponding aldehyde with H2O2 as the oxidizing co-substrate. The physiological relevance of this activity is unknown. In sum, all three enzymes possess some peroxidase activity, with HppE being by far the most efficient, but only HEPD and MPnS exhibit the 4e--oxidative C-C-cleavage activity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10453], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carsten Krebs", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Squire J Booker", "Michael Thomas Green", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carsten Krebs, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Chair", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Organophosphonate", "mechanism", "HppE", "HEPD", "MPnS", "non-heme-iron dependent enzyme"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF SERVICESCAPES ON THE PRE-CONSUMPTION AUTHENTICITY ASSESSMENTS OF ETHNIC-ORIENTED SERVICES", "id": "11715", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1280", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Authenticity, typically defined as being genuine, real, or true (Taylor, 1991), plays an essential role in the consumption of both goods and services (Jacknis, 1990; Lowenthal, 1992; Grayson & Martinec, 2004). Consumers think of the objects and services they perceive as authentic as having a deeper meaning and more value than those they see as inauthentic (Carroll & Wheaton, 2009; Frazier et al., 2009). This study investigates customers\u2019 pre-consumption authenticity perceptions and consequent patronage intention, in the context of ethnic oriented services. \n \tThis study proposes that the servicescape offers customers easily accessible cues based on which they make authenticity assessments. The three key elements of the servicescape--- physical setting, service providers, and other customers, each convey ethnic orientation.

The results suggest that servicescape dimensions can induce pre-consumption authenticity perceptions of service offerings and that the dimensional cues interplay to affect authenticity assessments. A customer\u2019s ethnicity affects how she/he interprets servicescape cues and, therefore, his/her authenticity assessment. Furthermore, perceived authenticity increases patronage intentions among ethnic customers but does so among mainstream customers only when they are already relatively familiar with the ethnic-oriented service. \n\tThis dissertation contributes to our empirical understanding of authenticity assessments.

As a negative outcome, public cloud providers may find increased occurrence of periods when tenant needs exceed available resources, which may hurt both the cloud's and the tenants' profitability. In the traditional cluster computing and private cloud setting, since the tenants have full control over the computing resources provisioned by the cloud, the cloud and the tenants could collaborate to optimize the cost-efficacy of the overall eco-system. However, when moving to public clouds, the cloud provider and its tenants become selfish entities that interact with each other but only focus on their own profitability; the existence of multi-tenancy further complicates the situation. It is thus essential to revisit the prior work of both private and public cloud settings and the emerging technologies in public clouds, and explore effective ways of improving both entities' cost-efficacy.\n\nOn the cloud side, on the one hand, there have been proposals to minimize the cloud's operational costs via various control knobs. However, despite these efforts, it remains a challenging problem due to (i) the complexity of different control knobs and (ii) the complexity of utility pricing, which could combine to result in optimal control problem formulations that are computationally intractable and difficult to cast and update upon changes. On the other hand, utility providers usually take two canonical approaches for incentivizing appropriate customer behaviors as well as maximizing their profitability: (i) dynamic pricing and (ii) dynamic capacity modulation. When adapting to public clouds, new challenges arise due to the cloud's lack of knowledge of the tenants' demands and responses, and the idiosyncrasies of tenants' computing resource needs, which are entirely different from that of the traditional utility providers. \n\nOn the tenant side, public clouds already offer a variety of procurement options, catering to the needs of a growing and diverse body of tenant workloads. The tenant is now confronted with a dizzying array of resource procurement options with tradeoffs of price dynamism vs. capacity dynamism vs. scaling granularity, which implies great cost-saving potential but may also result in tenant procurement problems that grow exponentially in size. In particular, Amazon EC2 spot instance is a representative virtual machine (VM) offering that is provisioned with such a price dynamism vs. capacity dynamism tradeoff. Prior works have usually employed simple statistical models for price dynamism prediction of spot instances for tractability concerns. However they neglect the key features of spot instance prices that could be leveraged to further improve the tenant's service contiguity and application performance. Therefore, constructing a scalable yet effective solution is of great importance for cost-effective tenant resource procurement and is one of the main focuses of this dissertation.\n\n\n\nThis dissertation develops solutions for improving both the cloud's and the tenants' cost-efficacy in a public cloud eco-system subject to cloud-tenant interactions. The dissertation is composed of two main parts. In the first part, we focus on the cloud-side control problem: (a) We\ninvestigate the problem of optimizing the cloud's operational costs in the face of the scalability limitations of such optimal control problems. We design a hierarchical framework that employs temporal aggregation and spatial (control knob) abstraction to achieve scalability and an ease of casting/updating upon changes. We also provide a suite of algorithms within the framework to deal with workloads with different degrees of predictability. (b) We explore the problem of improving the cloud's profitability via explicit dynamic effective capacity modulation and dynamic pricing. We formulate a leader/follower game-based control framework and evaluate the benefits of the proposed approaches using both trace-driven simulation and lab-based prototype system experiments. Our evaluation also provides useful insights for tenants that may choose such public cloud offerings.\n\nIn the second part, we focus on the tenant-side cost-effective resource procurement. Since the current public cloud providers do not offer VMs with the futuristic properties proposed in this dissertation, we take Amazon EC2 spot instance, on-demand instances and burstable instances as representative VM offerings from public clouds with similar (yet not the same) properties, and explore the potential cost-benefit for tenants that use these options (or a subset of these) collectively. To better assist tenant operations, we identify the key features of spot instance prices and provide scalable data-driven models when applicable. Then we present two real-world tenant case studies incorporating these key features, as well as using these VM options to achieve the desirable cost-performance trade-off. We also adapt existing system techniques and develop software suites, customized according to the specific application properties. To further improve the tenant's cost-efficacy through fine-grained resource scaling, we devise feedback controllers which incorporate the idiosyncrasies of different computing resources. In the evaluation, we show that our proposed approaches can achieve significant cost-savings while satisfying application performance targets.

Hydrogen spillover in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been proposed to reach the Department of Energy (DOE) hydrogen storage goals 5.5 wt% (2015) and 7.5 wt% (ultimate). The adjustable surface, porosity, and chemical functionality are beneficial to the hydrogen spillover research, in order to observe the evidence of atomic hydrogen dissociated from transition metals, to understand possible mechanism of hydrogen spillover, and ultimately to manipulate the adsorbent structure to get high uptakes at ambient environments.\n\nIn this study, copper type MOFs Cu-BTC and Cu-TDPAT, as well as zinc type MOF IRMOF-8, were studied. Different transition metal (Pt) doping methods were examined to determine the best way to synthesize catalyst-MOF composites, with no loss in structural integrity and with high hydrogen storage at room temperature. Pre-bridge (PB) technique was adopted to prepare platinum on activated carbon (Pt/AC) with copper type MOF Cu-TDPAT (T), which showed good structural stability and the highest hydrogen adsorption at 300 K 1 bar (4.9 cc/g STP, 0.045 wt%) among other catalyst-MOFs, and among the uptakes reported in the literature. Spectroscopic evidence in XPS and FTIR support the discovery of atomic hydrogen (1) in between the Cu-O-C bond that connects the TDPAT ligand to the copper paddlewheel (Cu PDW) in MOFs, (2) the sp2 N aromatic heterocycles in the center ring and (3) the secondary-amine type NH in the branches of TDPAT. However, hydrogen uptake of PB-T was 0.8 wt% at 70 bar, with limited slow kinetics.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to catalysts, addition of the activated carbon (AC) to MOF Cu-TDPAT also improved hydrogen storage. This is possibly due to the introduction of the defects, or partial charging of the MOF, supported by increased external surface area, the copper oxidation state measured by XPS, and density functional theory showing charged ligands are prone to hydrogenation. To further study the role of defects, carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption in FTIR was used to probe Cu-TDPAT and Cu-BTC. Strong CO-Cu+ adsorption is observed at 150 K ~5 psi, and in TPD-FTIR, CO desorption from Cu+ occurred over 300 K, relatively to CO-Cu2+ adsorption at over 200 K. No CO adsorption in Cu-TDPAT was found, regardless of pretreatment conditions, sample preparations, and adsorption temperatures. Pore size effect and electron donation/withdraw are consistent of lack of CO-Cu adsorption in Cu-TDPAT.\n\nOverall, the hydrogen uptake of catalyst Pt/AC on MOF Cu-TDPAT did not reach the DOE target 5.5 wt% at the pressure 70 bar, with the limitation of slow kinetics. The major limitations to catalyzed Cu-TDPAT (as well as other catalyzed MOFs) to meet the gravimetric targets at 300 K are high molecular weight of copper, high diffusion energy barrier, and material instability.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10220], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Cheng-yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cheng-yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angela Lueking", "Chunshan Song", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angela Lueking, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adsorption", "catalysis", "hydrogen spillover", "metal-organic framework"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INSTRUCTION MEDIA AND LEARNING PERFORMANCE BASED ON ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM", "id": "x920fw84d", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12488", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Computer-based distance learning has changed the face of education.

To address these research gaps, this study uses a case study of older residents of Sarasota County, Florida and applies a qualitative method to understand the perception, preparedness, and evacuation intention of older people at risk from hurricane hazards. The individual in-depth interviews generate several findings. First, while older residents\u2019 knowledge of hurricane threats varied from simple to sophisticated, their perceptions of hurricane risks were predominantly low due to a local myth and hurricane quiescence in recent memory. Second, most older residents took generic actions by preparing extra water, food, and medications, but lacked efforts in more hurricane-specific preparedness due to complacency and lack of awareness, financial capital, and social capital. Third, although a minority of older residents would definitely either shelter in place or evacuate, most demonstrated flexibility with hurricane evacuation and would make spontaneous and situational choices for staying versus leaving in the event of a hurricane. In sum, this dissertation utilizes a qualitative inquiry to weave richer personal and contextual details that are less visible through a quantitative lens to make sense of a population-specific and site-specific vulnerability to hurricane hazards.

These objectives were achieved by performing a series of numerical simulations using the numerical model CS2 (Fox and Berles 1997; Fox and Pu 2012).  GCL consolidation was assessed for three values of initial overburden stress (10 kPa, 100 kPa and 1000 kPa), six load increment ratios (LIRs) (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5), double-drained (DD) and single-drained (SD) conditions, and two values of specific gravity (1.0 and 2.21).   Constitutive relationships for GCL compressibility and hydraulic conductivity were taken from experimental data published by Kang and Shackelford (2010). \n     Values of consolidation times t_50, t_70, t_90, t_95, and t_98 are presented for various conditions and plotted versus LIR.  Consolidation times for both DD and SD conditions decrease as LIR increases for a given initial overburden stress, and these times decrease as initial overburden stress increases at a given LIR.  The longest predicted time required for 98% GCL consolidation and SD conditions is 32.5 h, which corresponds to low initial stress and low LIR.  Thus, for a direct shear test, the recommended consolidation time for a GCL prior to the start of shearing is 48 h for single-drainage.  The longest predicted time required for 98% GCL consolidation and DD conditions is 8.1 h, which also corresponds to low initial stress and low LIR.  Thus, the recommended consolidation time for a GCL prior to the start of shearing is 24 h or overnight for double-drainage.  \n     This study found that the ratios of consolidation times for DD to SD conditions are approximately equal to 4.0 in all cases, which is consistent with classical consolidation theory.  Numerical solutions obtained for G_s = 1 are nearly identical to corresponding solutions obtained for G_s = 2.21.  This indicates the effect of self-weight of GCL solids is negligible, which is consistent with GCLs being very thin materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13323], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Chu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Joseph Fox", "Tong Qiu", "Ming Xiao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Joseph Fox, Thesis Advisor", "Tong Qiu, Committee Member", "Ming Xiao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geosynthetic clay liner", "consolidation", "shear strength testing"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION AND INFERENCE FOR CONDITIONAL VALUE-AT-RISK AND EXPECTED SHORTFALL", "id": "15123czw5227", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15123", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conditional Value-at-Risk (hereafter, CVaR) and Expected Shortfall (CES) play an important role in financial risk management.

First, to attract more influence-motivated campaign contributions, a\nCongressman should act more ambiguously when one lobby group has more advantage than the other. Second, a Congressman whose ideology is on extreme left or right will receive less in\ninfluence-motivated campaign contributions. It is interesting that a Congressman's ideological ambiguity may attract more campaign contributions although two lobby groups dislike the ambiguity by nature.\n\nChapter 2: How Ambiguous Is a Congressman?\n\nWe provide a measure of a Congressman's ideology and a measure of his ideological ambiguity to be used for empirical studies. Poole and Rosenthal and Heckman and Snyder have provided excellent ways to estimate a Congressman's ideology in a multi-dimensional space via roll call voting records, but it is difficult to extend their\nframework to provide a measure of a Congressman's ideological ambiguity. Starting with a one-dimensional model, we use a Probit model to estimate a Congressman's ideology as well as the ideological ambiguity. We show that ideological ambiguity is one important characteristic of Congressmen's voting behavior. We also find that Congressmen who are biased to the right or to the left tend to have more ambiguous ideologies.\n\nChapter 3: Campaign Contributions and Ideology\n\nCampaign contributions can be influence-motivated or election-motivated. In theory, influence-motivated campaign contributions should be given to unbiased (centrist) Congressmen, and a Congressman's ideological ambiguity may increase such influence-motivated contributions. On the other hand, election-motivated campaign contributions should be given to those Congressmen whose ideologies are biased to the right or to the left, and ideological ambiguity may deter such election-motivated\ncampaign contributions. This paper conducts an empirical study of the relationship between campaign contributions and Congressmen's ideological positions, as well as the ideological ambiguity shown in roll call voting records.

A large datacenter spends millions of dollars in yearly operational expenditures (op-ex) paying its electricity bills. An even larger capital expenditure (cap-ex) goes into provisioning its power infrastructure, to accommodate the peak power draw, even if this draw is never or rarely sustained. With consumers demanding more for less, extracting the maximum value out of every provisioned and consumed watt in these datacenters is critical to profitability and sustenance. \n\nThere have been proposals to underprovision the power infrastructure, sizing it to handle a high\npercentile of the power draw rather than occasional high peaks. Demand Response (DR) is then employed to address these high peaks at runtime by re-shaping, deferring or modulating demand temporally and spatially. Until now, datacenter DR has primarily used computing knobs such as consolidation, scheduling, migration, and power state modulation. Recently,  Energy Storage Devices (ESDs) have been proposed to provide a complementary alternative to these knobs. However, there are multiple issues and challenges in leveraging these ESDs for datacenter DR that require an in-depth study in the datacenter context, which is one major intent of this dissertation.\n\nOn the other hand, the primary usage of energy storage in today's datacenters, in the form of Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) devices, is to handle power outages. A significant portion of the datacenter power infrastructure's cap-ex goes into the backup power equipment - Diesel Generators (DGs) and UPSes - needed to sustain operation during utility power outages. However, with only a few power outages per year and the majority outages being shorter than a few minutes, it implies opportunities for underprovisioining backup infrastructure for cost savings. However, embarking on such underprovisioning mandates studying several ramifications - the resulting cost savings, the lower availability, and the performance and state loss consequences on individual applications - concurrently, which is another major focus of this dissertation.\n\nThe goal of this dissertation is to develop solutions for provisioning and harnessing ESDs to (i) improve datacenter demand\nresponse capabilities, and (ii) optimize datacenter backup power infrastructure cost via modeling, simulation and experimentation with datacenter workloads. The dissertation consists of two major parts. In the first part, we mainly focus on how to leverage ESDs for enhancing datacenter demand response capabilities. We first develop three different methodologies for provisioning and control energy storage: \n(1) heuristics based on real datacenter power demand peak and valley characteristics for easy and quick ESD provisioning; (2) an analytical model which captures the important peak/valley attributes and ESD properties to compare different ESD cost-effectiveness in shaving different kinds of power demands; (3) a generalized optimization platform for ESD provisioning, placement and control. Then, we design and implement a system software for managing these ESDs. With a 2-level power hierarchy prototype, we evaluate the impacts and benefits of different mechanisms and policies in harnessing ESDs using datacenter applications. \nIn the second part, we explore the datacenter backup power infrastructure design space, considering cost, availability, performance and application consequences of underprovisioning the backup infrastructure. We present a framework to quantify the cost of backup capacity that is provisioned, and implement techniques leveraging existing software and hardware mechanisms to provide as seamless an operation as possible for an application during a power outage. In the evaluation, we show that Diesel Generators can be completely removed in many cases, and compensated with additional battery energy capacity in the UPS units to achieve desirable cost-performance-availability tradeoff.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9832], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Di ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Di", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Chitaranjan Das", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Aman Kansal", "Lee David Coraor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anand Sivasubramaniam, Dissertation Advisor", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Chair", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Aman Kansal, Special Member", "Lee David Coraor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Datacenters", "Power Management", "Energy Storage", "Batteries"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "validation of controlling batch muller by energy dose", "id": "27438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12028", "abstract_tesi": "Foundries control batch muller of green sand system by controlling mulling cycle time.

This objective is achieved by\ninvestigating the optical responses of slanted chiral STFs to several\ntypes of excitation sources, such as plane waves, optical beams,\nand dipoles. These studies would also help integrate slanted chiral STFs\nwith semiconductor chips used in the electronics industry.\n\n\nFirst, the response of slanted chiral STFs to plane waves is\ninvestigated by developing a robust numerical procedure\ninvolving  the rigorous coupled--wave analysis. The prominent\nfeature of the planewave response is the partial exhibition of the circular\nBragg phenomenon in a nonspecular reflection mode and in its diminishment and\neven elimination by a Rayleigh--Wood anomaly.\n\n\nNext, the optical response of a slanted chiral STF with a central\ntwist defect is explored, numerically as well as analytically. Due\nto the twist defect, wave resonance occurs in a localized fashion in\nthe Bragg regime.  A remarkable crossover phenomenon is found in slanted chiral STFs for\nthe localization of wave resonance: When the slanted chiral STF is relatively thin,\na co--handed reflectance hole\noccurs in the Bragg regime; as the thickness increases, the co--handed reflectance hole diminishes to vanish\neventually, and is replaced by a cross--handed transmittance hole.\nA coupled--wave theory is employed to derive an approximate but closed--form\nsolution for axial wave propagation in chiral STFs.\nThe crossover phenomenon can be harnessed for the\ndesign of ultra--narrowband optical filters.\n\n\nFinally, the optical responses of slanted chiral STFs to both\noptical beams and dipolar radiations are examined, which are a\nstep closer to practical applications.

However, fabricating transistors at feature sizes in the\ndeep sub-micron regime is increasingly challenging and leads to significant variations in such \ncritical transistor parameters as transistor channel length, gate-oxide thickness, and threshold voltage. This manufacturing variability consequently causes substantial performance and power deviations from nominal values in identical hardware designs. As technology scales down relentlessly, the impact of these variations becomes even more pronounced. The established practice of designing for the worst case scenario is no longer a viable solution, since it yields overly pessimistic design estimates that unnecessarily increase design and manufacturing costs.\n\nThis realization has led to a marked shift from deterministic to statistical design methodologies\nacross all levels of the design hierarchy [14]. In this thesis, statistical design techniques ranging from gate level to system level have been proposed to mitigate the impact of the process variations. At the gate level, an efficient method is proposed to compute the criticality for paths and arcs/nodes simultaneously by a single breadth-first graph traversal with linear complexity in circuit size. At the module level, variation aware resource sharing and assignment techniques in high level synthesis is proposed. In addition to the design-time techniques, a module selection algorithm with joint post-silicon tuning and design-time optimization is proposed to further reduce the parametric yield loss. At the system level, the classical task scheduling and allocation algorithm is augmented to be variation aware.

They are loaded into ARGONAUTE (AGO) proteins, and mediate gene silencing by interacting with target transcripts through sequence-specific base pairing. In plants, small RNAs are classified into various different groups based on their biogenesis and function; microRNAs (miRNAs) and heterochromatic short-interfering RNAs (het-siRNAs) are the two most important types of small RNAs in flowering plants. \n\nPlant small RNAs are subject to various forms of modification. Despite intensive studies about miRNA modification, knowledge about het-siRNA modification is lacking. I systematically studied non-templated nucleotide patterns in plant small RNAs by analyzing small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) libraries from Arabidopsis, tomato, Medicago, rice, maize and Physcomitrella. Elevated rates of non-templated nucleotides were observed at the 3' end of plant small RNAs from wild-type specimens of all analyzed species. In all species I analyzed, 'off-sized' small RNAs, such as 25 nt and 23 nt siRNAs arising from het-siRNA loci, often had higher rates of non-templated nucleotides at the 3' end. In Arabidopsis, 23 nt siRNAs arising from het-siRNA clusters display a distinct pattern of 3'-non-templated nucleotides. This pattern of 3'-non-templated nucleotides in 23 nt siRNAs is not dependent on known terminal nucleotidyl transferases, and may result from modifications added to longer het-siRNA precursors.\n\nHet-siRNAs negatively regulate gene expression through the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Biogenesis of most het-siRNAs depends on the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and AGO4 is the major effector protein of het-siRNAs. Through genome-wide analysis of sRNA-seq data sets, I found that AGO4 is required for the accumulation of a small subset of het-siRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana. The accumulation of AGO4-dependent het-siRNAs also requires several other RdDM components, including RNA POLYMERASE V (Pol V), DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) and SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1). I also demonstrated that het-siRNA accumulation could not be fully recovered by a slicing-defective AGO4 from ago4 mutant plants. These data suggest that AGO4-dependent het-siRNAs are secondary het-siRNAs, whose biogenesis requires prior activities of RdDM at certain loci.\n\nIn the current RdDM model, AGO4-bound het-siRNAs target Pol V transcripts through sequence-specific base pairing. However, the details of such interactions are largely unknown. Through crosslinking immunoprecipitation by an Arabidopsis AGO4 antibody and subsequent high-throughput sequencing, I identified a handful of het-siRNA:target interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana. These de novo identified het-siRNA:target interactions suggest that het-siRNAs act on both cis and trans loci. Successful interaction between a het-siRNA and its target(s) requires extensive base-pairing, and induces target cleavage between the 10th to 11th nucleotide counting from the 5' end of het-siRNAs.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13745], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Feng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Feng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael J.

We then defined ten classes of plant cyclins based on phylogenetic analyses. Expression analyses also showed that Arabidopsis cyclins exhibit diverse expression patterns at the tissue level. The results suggest that plants possess a larger and more complex family of cyclins than animals. To provide further evidence for SDS as a cyclin gene and characterize different SDS protein domains, I generated six different SDS truncations and studied them in the budding yeast. It was found that SDS can rescue a yeast G1 cyclin deficient mutant and can interfere with the mitotic cell cycle in wild type yeast. Comparative studies of the SDS truncations also suggested that a portion of the N-terminal region upstream of the cyclin domain is required for SDS function in the yeast system. Further study of the full-length SDS and an SDS truncation, SDS201-578, in Arabidopsis showed that the SDS N-terminal region is required for the full activity of SDS. The meiotic phenotypes in the partially rescued sds meiocytes by SDS201-578 confirmed the requirement of SDS in synapsis.

Needle coke is a premium solid carbon used in manufacturing graphite electrodes for electric-arc furnace. For the first time in the open literature, this study reports data on the molecular composition of the feed that is actually introduced into the coke drum for delayed coking after fractionating the decant oil feedstock together with the liquid products generated from coking. The coker feed (CF), thus, includes the high-boiling fraction of the decant oil and the high-boiling fraction of liquid products (recycle). Hydrotreated fraction of the decant oil samples (HYD) and a vacuum tower bottom (VTB) obtained from decant oils were also analyzed. More emphasis was placed on analyzing the high-boiling fraction of the feedstocks that is not amenable to gas chromatography.   Carbonaceous mesophase development from the feedstocks was also studied to seek relationships between the composition of the feedstocks and the needle coke texture. \nCommercial FCC decant oil (DO) samples and their derivatives (CF, HYD, and VTB) were carbonized in laboratory reactors. DO samples produced semi-cokes that displayed different degrees of mesophase development and CF, HYD and VTB give a higher degree of mesophase development compared to their parent decant oil. Significant differences were observed in the molecular composition of the different decant oil samples and between the decant oils and their derivatives. The principal compounds found in decant oils and their derivatives were found to consist of 3- to 6-ring PAHs (phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, benzopyrene, perylene, and benzoperylene). These PAHs are present in the feedstocks as multi-methyl substituted homologues. Compared to the parent DO, CF contains higher concentrations of unsubstituted PAHs, a lower degree of methyl substitution, and a higher proportion of thermally stable alkyl PAH isomers. HYD, on the other hand, contains a significantly higher proportion of hydroaromatics and much lower concentrations of sulfur compounds. The VTB fraction consists almost exclusively of PAH with 4 and higher number of condensed rings.\nIn general, mesophase development from the feedstocks was observed to relate to the overall carbonization reactivity (rate of semi-coke formation) and the relative concentrations of pyrenes and phenanthrenes. This trend confirms a widely accepted notion that the lower the carbonization reactivity, the higher is the degree of mesophase development. Samples of CF and HYD exhibit a relatively low carbonization reactivity (compared with their parent DO) and exhibit a high degree of mesophase development. As one exception to the general trend, VTB fractions exhibited the highest carbonization reactivity, but produced a well developed anisotropic coke texture. \nThe carbonization reactivity of the feedstocks depends on their molecular composition, as exemplified by the comparison of CF with DO. This study shows that the relative distribution of pyrene and phenanthrene compounds plays a significant role in the mesophase development from the needle coke feedstocks. A preliminary quantum chemistry modeling (MNDO level of theory) was conducted using phenanthrenes and pyrenes as models. The results gave a relatively high reaction rate constant for the formation of oligomers with non-planar configuration from phenanthrenes.

Crud deposits with high concentration of boron species will result in an axial offset anomaly (AOA), usually named Crud Induced Power Shift (CIPS) due to the effect of the boron on the power shape distribution. If the crud deposit is thick enough at high heat flux level, it may cause fuel rod surface dryout and accelerate cladding corrosion. This study examines and measures the crud thermal conductivity at PWR operating conditions, which is one of the most important parameters for simulating CIPS and thick crud dryout phenomena. \n\nTo better understand crud formation and measure crud thermal conductivity on the fuel rod cladding surfaces at pressurized water reactor operating conditions, a single rod crud Thermal-Hydraulic test facility was built at the Westinghouse Science and Technology Center (STC) in October 2005. Since then, a number of updates have been made to the test facility, which was named the Westinghouse Advanced Loop Tester (WALT). \n\nRecently, a four regime theory and methodology has been proposed for crud thermal conductivity study and measurement. Meanwhile, a number of preliminary tests have been performed in the WALT loop, which was utilized to successfully generate crud and measure its thermal parameters as a function of crud thickness and fluid conditions. In the WALT test loop, crud is deposited on the heater rod surface, then the crud characteristics are confirmed to be similar to these observed in the PWRs and the crud from the WALT loop has been determined to be representative of crud observed in PWRs. After the WALT loop crud thermal conductivity is calculated based on other direct measurements, it can be used to evaluate cladding surface temperatures at various crud thicknesses and thermal-hydraulic conditions. \n\nIn this dissertation, the method for crud thermal conductivity measurement and some preliminary test results from the WALT loop is presented and discussed. Furthermore, since the WALT system is also being utilized by Westinghouse to perform crud dry-out testing, these test results are also used to validate models used in the thermal-hydraulic codes and to support the industry goal of zero fuel failures by 2010 and beyond, established by commercial nuclear industry executives at an Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) meeting.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2128], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Guoqiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guoqiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seungjin Kim", "Seungjin Kim", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Digby D Macdonald", "William A Byers", "Mr Michael Y Young (Special Member)", "Mr Zeses Karoutas (Special Member)", "Mr Robert L Oelrich, Jr (Special Member)", "Dr Lawrence E Hochreiter (Deceased)"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seungjin Kim, Dissertation Advisor", "Seungjin Kim, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member", "William A Byers, Committee Member", "Mr Michael Y Young (Special Member), Committee Member", "Mr Zeses Karoutas (Special Member), Committee Member", "Mr Robert L Oelrich, Jr (Special Member), Committee Member", "Dr Lawrence E Hochreiter (Deceased), Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["VIPRE/BOA", "PWR Conditions", "Thermal Conductivity", "Crud Dryout"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MODELING AND EVALUATING THE SURVIVABILITY OF AN INTRUSION TOLERANT DATABASE SYSTEM\n", "id": "7886", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The immaturity of current intrusion detection techniques limits the traditional security systems in surviving malicious attacks. Intrusion tolerance approaches have emerged to overcome these vulnerabilities. Before intrusion tolerance is accepted as an approach to security, there must be quantitative techniques to measure its survivability. However, there are very few attempts to do quantitative, model-based evaluation of the survivability of intrusion tolerant systems, especially in database field. In this thesis, I focus on modeling the survivability of an intrusion tolerant database system in the presence of attacks.\n\nBefore studying the survivability of intrusion tolerant systems, we need to have a better understanding of the attack behavior and its degree of spreading. Based on the classical epidemic model, a stochastic database damage propagation model is proposed. This model leads to a better understanding and prediction of the scale and speed of database damage propagation.\n\nTo study the survivability, the intrusion tolerant database system is modeled as a series of state transition models. Based on the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and semi-Markov models, quantitative measures are proposed to characterize the capability of a resilient database system surviving intrusions. These facilitate a systematic evaluation to capture the survivability of intrusion tolerant database systems and the impact of system deficiencies on it. An Intrusion Tolerant DataBase system (ITDB) is studied as an example.\n\nMy experiment results validate the proposed CTMC and semi-Markov models. Survivability evaluation is conducted to study the impact of attack intensity and different system deficiencies on system survivability. The impact of intrusion tolerance operations on performance is also evaluated using the TPC-C benchmark.

Such regulatory modules consist of cis-regulatory modules, which are the DNA sequences involved in regulation, and the trans-acting factors, mostly proteins, that act at those sites. \nMany cis-regulatory modules (CRM) are clusters of distinctive motifs that, when bound by sequence-specific transcription factors, cause an increase or decrease in the amount of transcription from a target promoter. These modules can be identified experimentally by gene transfer or mutagenesis experiments, and in this thesis I modify and adapt two functional assays for finding CRMs. Work in this thesis shows that this process can be facilitated by bioinformatic approaches based on analysis of multispecies alignments.\nWe use a discriminatory function, called the regulatory potential (RP) score, to find patterns in aligned sequences that are more similar to those observed in known regulatory elements. Using transcriptome analysis from rescued G1E cells (a murine Gata1- cell line) and induced murine erythroleukemia cells, we identify genes whose expression changes dramatically during erythroid maturation and might have GATA-1 and its binding site involved in their regulations. We couple RP score with another filter, conservation of predicted binding sites for the transcription factor GATA-1, to refine the prediction because most known erythroid CRMs have binding sites for this essential erythroid transcription factor and its binding specificity has been studied thoroughly. These candidate CRMs were tested in reporter gene assays in transiently transfected K562 cells and marked-murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL_RL5) by site-directed integration. Selected CRMs are also tested by site-directed mutagenesis of GATA-1 and by chromatin immunoprecipitation to measure in vivo GATA-1 occupancy. These tested DNA elements served as an initial set in which to evaluate the power of bioinformatic predictions based on RP scores plus conserved GATA-1 binding sites. The validated elements can be examined for features in common and the results can be fed back into the efforts to improve the prediction procedures and reiterative runs of bioinformatic analyses are expected to refine the prediction of erythroid cis-regulatory modules with greater utility and effectiveness. \nAfter targeted stable integration in MEL_RL5 cells, the orientation of the integrants was determined by genomic blot-hybridization in previous studies. To develop a higher throughput approach for functional analysis of preCRMs, we mapped the location of the RL5 locus of MEL cells. This also allows future studies on the effects of integrated CRMs on flanking loci. \nThe beta-globin gene complex has served as a paradigm for studying regulated switch in gene expression during development. Although extensively studied, the precise role in regulation has not been established for more than a few of the known regulatory modules and proteins acting at these sites are less well defined. Reverse-genetic approaches using antisense strategies have been used to test the function of candidate proteins at a selected subset of these sites. We have been working on constructing cell lines inducibly expressing interfering molecules that can be the beginnings of effective approaches to elucidating complex networks of interactions and pathways in globin gene regulation. Such inducible interfering systems into which erythroid cis-regulatory modules can be tested should lead to a more accurate delineation of these DNA sequences.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2225], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Webb Colby Miller", "Pamela J Mitchell", "Robert Paulson", "Anton Nekrutenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Chair", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["regulatory potential", "gene regulation", "conserved noncoding sequences", "transcription factor binding sites"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF DIMENSIONALITY, SAMPLE TOPOLOGY, AND DISORDER ON SUPERCONDUCTIVITY\n\n\n", "id": "7398", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary goal of this thesis work is to explore various phenomena related to the effects of dimensionality, sample topology, and disorder on superconductivity, motivated by theoretical questions and potential applications of superconductivity.

The aim of this research was to study the problem of underground coal mine void detection by using the in-seam seismic (ISS) technique. This technique refers to methods that utilize artificially generated channel waves trapped in coal seams to locate geologic disturbances and mine voids. ISS is one of the basic geophysical methods for underground survey. The advantage of ISS is that seismic energy in the form of channel waves is better preserved, and therefore seismic waves can be detected over much larger distances compared with those radiating three-dimensionally.\n\nThere are many technical problems and theoretical challenges related to the development of the ISS-based void detection technique, especially the acquisition of high quality seismic signals and the interpretation of these signals. First, there are practical issues related to data acquisition in underground coal mines. One has to face the problems of field tests with limited space and irregular source-receiver geometry. Second, there are challenges with data processing because of the underground environment and complex seismic signals. It was necessary to reduce the ambiguity conventionally associated with routine geophysics methods and to find an efficient data processing and void mapping method that is suitable for underground surveys. \n\nAn important outcome of this research is the investigation of a set of comprehensive data analysis approaches that are suitable for ISS signals processing. The main contribution of this research is the development of wavelet analysis based signal processing methods. The wavelet transform, which studies a signal in both the time domain and the frequency domain, was successfully applied to time-frequency analysis, dispersion analysis, and decomposition and reconstruction of channel waves. Wavelet transform, a unique approach introduced in this thesis for the ISS technique, proved to be an efficient tool for signal analysis, including detecting newly merged signals and enhancing reflection signals.\nISS basically uses reflection surveys to detect mine voids, and such reflection signals are much more difficult to identify than transmission signals. Using the Fourier transform, wavelet transform, and other tools, such as the gain controlled stacking method, the reflection signals were enhanced and detected with clear arrivals. Void mapping was realized by a simple and robust method called the elliptical mapping method which is inherently compatible with the complex underground mine conditions and supports simultaneous data processing. \n\nGeophysics methods have been widely used for underground surveys. Among several geophysics approaches for mine void detection, ISS has several distinctive advantages, including high resolution and reliability, long survey distance, and low cost. Thus, the ISS technique and associated signal analysis methods developed in this research appear to provide a very promising technique for mine void detection. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2283], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Hongliang Henry", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "Henry", "first_name_ssi": "Hongliang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mining Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maochen Ge", "Margaret Hardy", "Vladislav Kecojevic", "Derek Elsworth", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maochen Ge, Committee Chair", "Margaret Hardy, Committee Member", "Vladislav Kecojevic, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Signal Processing", "In-Seam Seismic", "Void Detection", "Wavelet Transform"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE APPROACH FOR HUMAN-GIS COMMUNICATION OF VAGUE SPATIAL CONCEPTS", "id": "7502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Natural multimodal interfaces have been proposed as an alternative interface for geospatial information systems. A fundamental challenge in developing a usable conversational interface for GIS is effective communication of spatial concepts in natural language, which are commonly vague in meaning. This study recognizes and makes distinctions between two sources of vagueness in human-GIS communication: (1) there are multiple contexts within which a spatial concept can be interpreted (i.e. context-dependency); and (2) there are multiple interpretations of the same spatial concept in the same context (i.e. fuzziness). Existing studies have addressed the fuzziness aspect of the vagueness problem to a great extent, but little work has been done to handle the context-dependency sub-problem. This study focuses on the context-dependency nature of vague spatial concepts. The goal is to enable effective communication of vague spatial concepts in spoken language human-GIS interaction through better managing, sharing, and utilizing contextual knowledge. \nToward this goal, this study has made two major contributions. Firstly, this study provides a Human Communication Framework (HCF) to facilitate our understanding and handling the vagueness problem in human-GIS communication. The HCF explains the vagueness problem in human-human communication, and human communication principles for handling this problem. It helps our understanding about major origins of vagueness, major types of contextual factors, distributed nature of context knowledge and need for building a shared context involved in human-GIS communication. Secondly, this study also provides a collaborative dialogue approach for the GIS to handle the context-dependency problem through collaborative human-GIS dialogues. This approach is driven by the success of collaborative human-human dialogues and distributed nature of context knowledge in human-GIS communication. An agent-based computational model, the PlanGraph model, has been developed to support this approach. This model enables the GIS: (1) to build and keep track of the shared context involved in human-GIS communication, (2) to understand the meaning of a vague spatial concept under constraints of the shared context, (3) to repair the shared context and further reduce vagueness through collaborative human-GIS dialogues, and (4) to effectively communicate vague spatial concepts with the user in various contexts.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2400], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Hongmei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongmei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guoray Cai", "Alan Maceachren", "Michael Mc Neese", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guoray Cai, Committee Chair", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member", "Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["natural spoken language enabled GIS", "human-GIS communication", "collaborative dialogue approach", "agent-based computational model", "vague spatial concept", "and context-dependent"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SIMULATION AND EVALUATION OF DIELECTRIC AND MAGNETOELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF DIPHASIC AND LAYERED FERROIC COMPOSITES\n\n\n\n", "id": "9184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2207", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present demand in the development of tunable devices and meta-materials require better understanding of the composite systems. Ferroelectric based composites with solubility or impurities doped interstitially satisfied the specific condition necessary for applications of e.g. frequency, bias, temperature, etc. On the other hand, many composite materials using coupling phenomena have been reported to have their effective properties surpassing the natural materials. The improvement of the properties of composite materials lies on the better understanding of their coupling effects. Conventional science tries to derive theories based on observation and materials characterizations. Taken advantage of the rapid growing computer technology, one used to say \u00a1\u00b0impossible to be measured\u00a1\u00b1 or \u00a1\u00b0impossible to see\u00a1\u00b1 can now be virtually characterized and visualized by simulation models. In this thesis, computer models of dielectric properties, piezoelectricity, magnetostriction and magnetoelectricity were constructed and verified. And subsequently the materials of interest were simulated and discussed. First, a three dimensional finite element model on dielectric properties of two phases or materials mixture was constructed. The effective permittivity and tan(D) of Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3:MgO composite were simulated and compared with the experimental results. Structural design parameters concepts such as layers stacking, geometry effect, and effect of size of inclusion were visualized and then discussed. Subsequently, dielectric properties of Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3:MgO composite were examined changing their volume fraction using Monte Carlo simulation. The type of connectivity of the Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3:MgO composite was also discussed. On the other hand, finite element method with Monte Carlo simulation was conducted for the composition (x)Pb0.2Sr0.8TiO3: (1-x)MgO from x=0 to 1 in the paraelectric phase (from -50\u00a2\u00aaC to 200\u00a2\u00aaC), and the results were computed and compared with the experimental data. The temperature dependence of the relative permittivity of composites was well predicted up to 35.5% volume fraction of (Sr0.8Pb0.2)TiO3, which is sufficient for the composition of interest (usually a few percent of MgO). The simulation results showed little discrepancy as MgO volume fraction increases. Several possible factors resulting in the differences between experimental results and simulations were discussed. The empirically estimated critical volume fraction fc proposed by Wakino et al. for Pb0.2Sr0.8TiO3:MgO composites was here estimated at ~0.9 throughout the Pb0.2Sr0.8TiO3 paraelectric phase temperature range. The results indicated that the critical volume fraction fc is a system varying parameter. In the final part of the thesis, a magnetostrictive and piezoelectric coupling model that estimates the electric/magnetic transfer efficiency (dE/dH) was presented. The magnetoelectric model was constructed based on two simulation models i.e. piezoelectric model and magnetostriction model. The piezoelectric model was constructed in dielectric model template adding the third rank piezoelectric effect. A commercial PZT transducer was experimentally measured with its properties. Related properties were then input for simulations and the resonance frequency of the specific PZT was successfully predicted. In addition, modes of resonance frequencies of the specific PZT were able to be visualized and identified. The magnetostriction model was constituted with its forth rank property. Mathematical formula and a modified model based on Langevin theory were appended to the original piezoelectric and magnetostrictive equations to simulate the saturated elastic responses in the coupled systems. A laminated Terfenol-D/PZT/Terfenol-D magnetoelectric composite system was modeled that permits simulated evaluation of coupling properties e.g., magnetostrictive coefficient and strain vs. magnetic field response. The electromagnetic transfer efficiency of the modeled results was in good agreement with experimental value in literature. Magnetostrictive response of the specific Terfenol-D was discussed regarding to the rotation of its crystallographic orientation. The results indicated that improvements can be achieved by a proper rotation of the materials orientation.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2188], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Hsiao-Yuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hsiao-Yuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla", "Amar S Bhalla", "Ruyan Guo", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal", "Leslie Eric Cross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amar S Bhalla, Dissertation Advisor", "Amar S Bhalla, Committee Chair", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Chair", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, Committee Member", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SIMULATION", "METAMATERIALS", "MAGNETOELECTRIC", "DIELECTRIC"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "DESIGN OF SHALLOW AND THERMALLY STABLE CONTACTS ON ANTIMONIDE-BASED SEMICONDUCTORS", "id": "6426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2372", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation addresses the development of shallow and thermally stable metallizations for Sb-based compound semiconductors for high speed, low power electronic devices. The factors that influence the contact resistance, thermal stability, and shallowness of the ohmic contacts to p-InGaSb were investigated. These contacts are important for the base of a 6.2 \u00c5 heterojunction bipolar transistor. A non-alloyed low resistance Pd/W/Au (2/50/145 nm) ohmic contact prepared using an (NH4)2S rinse treatment was developed with a specific contact resistance of 5.9 x 10^-7 Ohm cm^2. Tungsten serves as a diffusion barrier. Gold lowers the metal sheet resistance, which we have found both experimentally and through modeling to influence of contact resistance measurements, and palladium is used to make intimate contact at the metal/semiconductor interface. It was observed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy that the (NH4)2S rinse treatment effectively minimizes the thickness of any residual dielectric layer on the semiconductor, leading to a reduction in the specific contact resistance. In addition, the specific contact resistances of various metal/W/Au (2/50/145 nm) contacts were compared, and the (NH4)2S rinse is found to partially relieve Fermi level pinning at the contact/p-InGaSb interface. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy reveals that the Pt/W/Au contacts have better thermal stability than Pd/W/Au contacts, with the Pt/W/Au contacts remaining shallow even after they are aged at 250 \u00b0C for 3 days.\nThe thermal stability of various gate metallizations on InAs/AlGaAsSb/InAs heterostructures with and without the InAs cap removed was also investigated. These metallizations are important for high electron mobility transistors fabricated from the antimonide based compound semiconductors. The W/Au gate was found to be a good candidate for making stable contacts directly to AlGaAsSb. The Ti/Pt/Au (50/50/100 nm) and Co/Si/Co/Si/Co metallizations are more thermally stable on InAs than other metallizations tested.

I will first focus upon two contemporary interpretations of conscience: the existential interpretation by Heidegger and the psychoanalytic interpretation by Freud. \n\nMy investigation of the phenomenon of conscience in the context of these two interpretations would reveal the question of ethics, which according to Heidegger is a question of human dwelling, as a question of hermeneutics. By instigating a dialogue between Heidegger\u2019s thinking of the essence of human dwelling and the early Confucian moral teaching, I anticipate to work out a new horizon for the question of ethics. \n\nTraditional interpretations take conscience as the voice of the divine or social authorities that stipulate the norms and principles of our actions. Freud identifies the source of the traditional \u201cmoral conscience\u201d in the categorical imperatives of the super-ego or ego ideal, which answers to \u201ceverything that is expected of the higher nature of human.\u201d Religion, ethics and social institutions, accordingly, constitute different forms in which the ego ideal, which represses the primitive Oedipus complex, asserts itself. Heidegger, in contrast, developed an existential interpretation that takes conscience as a reticent summons that discloses the authentic situation of human existence in the world. Conscience calls us toward the authenticity of our being in that it calls us to think the tragic situation of human existence and the plight of human dwelling upon the earth. \n\nThrough a dialogue between these two incisive interpretations of the phenomenon of conscience and its relation to ethical thinking, I would make manifest the central strife in the question of ethics as a strife between two fundamental kinds of interpretation of human dwelling, which is in essence a strife between the \u201cpowerless superpower\u201d of heart and conscience and the demonic power of the super-ego that speaks in the voice of everyday \u201cmoral conscience.\u201d Since both the reticent summons of heart and conscience and the commanding voice of the super-ego can be viewed as different interpretations of the message from the divine, the question of ethics turns out to be a question of hermeneutics. \n\nThe clarification of the meaning and origin of conscience and its relation to the question of ethics in the west set the stage for a new possibility of ethical thinking and pave the way for a dialogue with the early Confucian thinkers. In contrast to western normative ethical theories, early Confucian teachings did not understand the essence of human being in terms of an ideal of existence. Nor did they base human moral practice upon a system of norms or principles. Rather, it is by following the reticent summons of one\u2019s heart and conscience that one is capable of appropriating the message of heaven and of bringing forth one\u2019s humane nature to the full. This dialogue between Confucian moral teaching and Heidegger\u2019s thinking of human dwelling would thus open up a new way of ethical thinking without resorting to a metaphysics of normativity.  This new way of ethical thinking will have broad and profound significance for rethinking a wide range of ethical and political issues today.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2399], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Hua ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt", "Charles Edward Scott", "Vincent M Colapietro", "On Cho Ng", "Christopher P Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Schmidt, Committee Chair", "Charles Edward Scott, Committee Chair", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Member", "On Cho Ng, Committee Member", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conscience", "Ethos", "heart", "Heidegger", "Freud"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Early Childhood Educators' Perceptions of Professional Competence in Preschool Settings\n", "id": "6789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overall purpose of this study was to examine Taiwanese in-service educators\u00a1\u00a6 perceptions of current status of and self-desire for professional competence in preschool settings.

The work is\nmotivated by some experimental and theoretical studies on tumor cell\nmetastasis, in particular, the earlier studies that have been done\nin Prof. Dong's lab. Some previous work demonstrated that PMNs can\nfacilitate tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium. Parallel plate\nflow chamber experiments have shown that under different flow\nconditions, tumor cells and PMNs adhere to each other and to the\nendothelium with different efficiencies. The comprehensive study of\nthe cell aggregation and adhesion is proceeded from three aspects:\nexperimental studies on the kinetics of cell aggregation, adhesion\nand deformation; computational fluid dynamical (CFD) modeling of\nindividual PMN and tumor cell interaction and adhesion; statistical\nstudy of large populations of cell aggregation. The experimental\nstudy and CFD modeling work conducted by Prof. Dong in his lab\nprovided us the basis of the present thesis work focusing on the\nstatistical study of cell aggregation.\n\nThe primary focus of this work is the development of mathematical\nmodels and numerical simulation methods for cell aggregation in\npopulations and the exploration of how the flow condition changes\nthe interactions of PMNs and tumor cells in the nonuniform shear\nflow. In this thesis, the coagulation equations (also called\nSmoluchowski or population balance equations) are used to model cell\naggregation in the near wall region in nonuniform shear flow. These\nequations have been used widely to study the time evolution of the\nparticle concentration in physics, biological and chemical\nengineering.\n\n\nThis thesis is organized as follows. First, we study the population\nbalance equations with bounded kernels and their numerical\napproximations. A comprehensive review of the coagulation equations\nis given first, such as the well-posedness problem and some other\nbasic properties. For the numerical approximation of the coagulation\nequation, a new formulation motivated by the Wild sum is utilized to\noffer a convenient framework for the analysis of the population\nbalance equations. It also leads naturally to a time relaxed method\nfor the numerical solution of the coagulation equations. This time\nrelaxed method is shown to be a  high order convergent numerical\nscheme that preserves the non-negativity of the solution and the\ntotal volume conservation. Furthermore, we study several\ndeterministic algorithms for the numerical approximations of the\ndiscrete Smoluchowski coagulation equations, such as  the time\nrelaxed marching method and the stabilized Euler method. Their\nstability and convergence properties are examined, and error\nestimates are derived. Particular attention is given to issues such\nas the high order accuracy, the preservation of the total volume,\nand the non-negativity of the population density. The numerical\nexamples and comparison tests are presented to demonstrate the\nperformance of the algorithms. We also check the consistency of the\ncomputational complexity estimation and the real CPU running time.\nThe application of these numerical methods to\ncoagulation-fragmentation is also taken into account.\n\nIn order to bridge the deterministic coagulation equation and the\nstochastic coagulation dynamical system, we also develop a\nstochastic interpretation of the coagulation equation. We show that\nthe density function of the stochastic coagulation process satisfies\nthe coagulation equation. Based on this model, a backward Monte\nCarlo method is developed. We also present a formulation of the\ncoagulation equation by using an energetic variation framework based\non discussions with Prof. Liu. The energetic variation formulation\nmodel the coagulation equation by a deterministic dynamical system\nin which case the model can be described by the energy law. Overall,\nwe provide both the stochastic and deterministic formulations for\nthe coagulation equation. Furthermore, our studies on the relations\nof stochastic and deterministic formulations show the consistency of\nthese two formulations. Several examples, for instance, the\ntransport equation, the diffusion equation, and the coagulation\nequation, demonstrate that the deterministic model can be derived\nfrom the stochastic model and its consistency is verified.\n\n\n\n\nThe applications of the coagulation model to cell aggregation is\njoint work with Prof. Dong and his research group. We develop a\nsimple population balance model for cell aggregation and adhesion\nprocess in a nonuniform shear flow. Some Monte Carlo simulation\nresults based on the model are presented for the heterotypic\ncell-cell collision and adhesion to a substrate under dynamic shear\nforces. In particular, we focus on leukocyte (PMN)-tumor cell emboli\nformation and subsequent tethering to the vascular endothelium (EC)\nas a result of cell-cell aggregation. The simulation results are\ncompared with the results of experimental measurement. We also\ndevelop a modified population balance model to describe the cell\naggregation in the near wall region. In this model, the tethering\nfrequency, adhesion efficiency, and collision rate of deformable\ncells are also discussed.\n\nFor the spatially inhomogeneous coagulation equation,  we first\nintroduced the Lagrangian model. By the deterministic formulation in Section 3.4, we derive the equation by considering  the\nconservation law of a coupled system which involves spatial variable\nand particle size variable. By the conservation law formulation,\nfirst, we develop a model in which the coagulation kernel and fluid\ndynamics are given, then we consider a self-consistent model where\nthe particle motion and coagulation are induced by a given\ntransition probability. \n\n\nFinally, we present some issues for future studies.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3097], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jiakou ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiakou", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiang Du", "Cheng Dong", "Chun Liu", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiang Du, Committee Chair", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "Chun Liu, Committee Member", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cell aggregation", "coagulation equation", "stochastic model", "time relaxed method"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Active and Passive Procrastination of University Students Enrolled in Writing Courses Across Varying Course Delivery Models", "id": "19878", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9301", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research aimed to extend the understanding of procrastination behaviors, with focus on the discussion of a debatable construct, active procrastination, as a distinctive form of procrastination that incorporates aspects of self-regulated learning and may lead to successful academic performance. The majority of past literature focused solely on the dysfunctional aspects of procrastination behavior, and regarded it as a manifestation of self-regulatory failure or as a self-handicapping strategy. However, some studies reported that high achieving individuals are also found to engage in procrastination behaviors, although they are assumed to be better self-regulators. Based upon these findings, some researchers queried that a different form of procrastination behavior might exist, and more likely to be found among high-achieving individuals. In line with this hypothesis, this thesis examined the active procrastination construct by analyzing reports of undergraduate students enrolled in writing courses of different class settings. Four validated instruments were adopted in this study to measure students\u2019 procrastination tendency, self-regulated learning, and self-handicapping tendency. Students\u2019 performance outcomes as indicated by their assignment scores and their GPA were also analyzed. Anchored reports of task completion in relation to deadlines coupled with students\u2019 assignment submission times were also collected along with other data, but not included in the current analysis. \nResults showed no differences in reported procrastination across class settings in terms of online versus social class environment. Yet as expected, students who enrolled in the honor\u2019s class reported higher active procrastination tendencies than non-honor students. The associations between active procrastination and self-regulated learning were significant and in the expected direction for self-efficacy, text anxiety and effort regulation subscales of the MSLQ. As hypothesized, reported active procrastination was not correlated with self-handicapping but yielded a surprising negative correlation with the PASS score. Also as expected, active procrastination was positively related to both GPA and paper score. The associations between active procrastination and other variables were not statistically significant. \n Additional analyses were conducted to examine between group differences based on students\u2019 procrastination patterns and their performance level. Findings lend partial support for the active procrastination construct. Result of procrastination patterns failed to find supporting evidence for the hypothesis that active procrastinators are different from their passive peers in self-handicapping tendency and aspects of self-regulated learning. However, the result of students\u2019 performance level supported that students with higher academic achievement would also report higher active procrastination tendencies. \nResults of this study corresponded to the mixed findings of previous literature about active procrastination.

During the 30-minute period following the meal, a higher percentage of bradygastric activity and a lower percentage of normal gastric activity were observed in obese participants than in normal-weighted participants. Furthermore, obese participants showed a different pattern of change in 3 cpm and bradygastric activity than normal-weighed participants during the 30 min. The whole 30-min period was divided into five 6-min periods. Obese participants and normal-weighted participants reacted similarly to the second food image exposure, except that a higher increase in 3 cpm activity was observed in the normal-weighted group in the period after the termination of viewing the food images. Conclusions: These data suggest that obese people react to food images and to food eating differently from normal-weighted people.

This method includes experimental design, finite element analysis, design sensitivity analysis, and optimization techniques. The identification of material properties is treated as an optimization problem, minimizing the difference between the numerical simulation results and the experimental data. Finite element analysis is the bottleneck in the optimization procedure since it takes a large portion of the total computational time. The modeling of the indentation test is simplified as an axisymmetric, small deformation problem with frictionless, small sliding contact. The formulations of the response and sensitivity analysis with contact are presented. The governing equations of the response and sensitivity analysis have the same tangent stiffness. The inclusion of the contact does not change this favorable property. Verifications have been performed on the implemented finite element code comparing both the theoretical results and ABAQUS simulation results. Good agreement has been achieved for both responses and sensitivities.\n\n\nThe implemented finite element code provides the function evaluation routine for the optimization process. To reduce the computational cost, it is essential that the number of iterations is as small as possible. Significant effort has been put on the estimation of the material constants. A good estimation will be close to the optimal point; and therefore can avoid being trapped into a remote minima region. The implemented estimation\nmethod is based on both theoretical solutions and empirical relations. In this thesis, the behavior of a polymer material is described by a 3-parameter rheological model, which includes a dashpot in parallel with an elasto-plastic spring. This spring represents a linear hardening plastic response. The analytical solution of viscoelastic indentation helps determine the viscosity of the dashpot and the elasto-plastic modulus. The remaining parameter in the model is obtained through curve fitting, which requires one finite element run.\n\n\nThe proposed estimation method provides an excellent estimation of the material constants. More accurate results are obtained through numerical optimization with the estimation as the starting point. The BFGS method is chosen as the optimization algorithm with slight modification to accommodate the simple bounds. Fast convergence\nis achieved using this modified BFGS method.

Many formalisms, such as FSA, GSMP, DEVS, Petri Net, SPADE, etc., have been proposed.  These formalisms have proved useful for modeling individual systems.  However, they become ineffective for some large-scale systems.  For instance, modern simulation federations often involve many participants, which are geographically distributed.  Each participant may implement federates using different technologies.  In addition, existing federates may retire from the federation, while new federates may enter into the federation.  This may require a change in the control flow of the simulation to reflect a frequently changing business model.  Therefore, modern simulation federations have three unique characteristics: heterogeneous, distributed, and adaptive.  As a result, formalisms for modern simulations should also provide companion semantics, such as: a) compositing heterogeneous systems into larger ones; b) coordinating distributed systems; and c) evolving existing systems into new ones without interrupting the current executions.   This thesis proposes a new formalism \u2013 called PiDES.  It develops formal models for individual DES federates and runtime infrastructure based on stochastic &#960;-calculus and High Level Architecture.  In order to demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits of the proposed formalism, a language definition and an interpreter of PiDES, along with a prototype implementation of PiDES-RTI are also developed.

Moreover, the emergency department, as one of the most important departments, is often faced with identified and potential perturbations. The identified perturbations include incidents with historical records, such as earthquakes. The potential perturbations consist of unpredictable absence of doctors and nurses.  Both situations need to be solved by the team in the emergency department. The doctors, nurses and other staff members need to make decisions within a limited time. In addition, with increasing number of patients and limited resources, the emergency department should pay attention to improving the efficiency of teamwork and reducing the treatment time for patients. \nThe limited resources and the overcrowding of patients would result in team resilience. Team resilience in the emergency department describes the ability of the system to handle all kinds of perturbation. When the system goes into a degraded or critical state, the team of the emergency department is in a resilient state. Moreover, team resilience would influence the performance of emergency departments and the waiting time of patients. \nIn this thesis, the team resilience was analyzed with identified and potential perturbations. Several proposals were designed and investigated to relief or solve the team resilience in emergency department. A discrete event simulation model was fabricated to evaluate the performance of these proposals under varying situations.\nThe simulation results in this thesis shows that the best solution to natural disasters or other identified perturbation is to add one nurse and one doctor. The primary waiting time for all patients can be reduced to 60 minutes. Also, the utilization of all resources could decrease by 70%. In this condition, the performance of the team in the emergency department could maintain in a normal state.\nThe performance of teams and the utilization of resources are analyzed with respect to potential perturbations. The environment is assumed to be a normal state in the beginning, and the influence of the absence of one doctor and one nurse is simulated. The results shows that this perturbation would increase the primary waiting time and the utilization of resources.  The primary waiting time for every patient is longer than that of normal state. The maximum primary waiting time is longer than 60 minutes and the acuity level of the patient is 5. It can be concluded that no resilience happens. When two doctors and two nurses are out of work all day, the primary waiting time of 1 or 2 patients can be longer than 60 minutes. The possibility of a degraded performance is 66%.\nWhen identified perturbations happen with one doctor and one nurse absent, the performance of the team would be degraded and remain critical for 24 hours. Varying time strategies of correction actions are analyzed. The earlier the corrections are made, the better team performed under perturbations. The correlation between resilience and amount of supplementary doctors and nurses is further discussed. Although there are no ways to eliminate the resilience, adding three doctors and three nurses could reduce the primary waiting time. Moreover, the coefficient of resilience would increase to 0.284. Hence, the performance of team could return to normal state after 9h 28 minutes after the occurrence of identified perturbation. \nAs a conclusion, the performance of the investigated emergency department is simulated and discussed in terms of two types of perturbation. According to simulation results, a response strategy in terms of supplementary doctors, nurses and resources is designed to minimize the expectation of resilience time in case of perturbations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16014], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock", "Yiqi Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ling Rothrock, Thesis Advisor", "Yiqi Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["team resilience", "efficiency of teams", "emergency department", "perturbation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SYSTEMATIC STUDY ON THE STRUCTURE-DYNAMICS RELATIONSHIP OF \nPOLY(ETHYLENE OXIDE)-BASED SINGLE-ION CONDUCTORS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "12039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To optimize the design of ion-containing polymers for advanced devices, the effects of different structural factors on the electrical properties of single-ion conductors (ionomers) needs to be investigated. There will be three main focuses in this study: (1) the effect of ion content, (2) the effect of side chain flexibility, and (3) free and attached ion solvation by ether oxygen atoms. By the design of ionomer systems and systematically varying the chemical structure, the structure-dynamic relationship is closely examined for all the PEO-based ionomers synthesized. The chemical structures were characterized by 1H NMR, and the thermal behavior of the ionomers was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The electrical properties were investigated by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). \n\nThe results of DSC Tg suggests that with increasing ion content, ions aggregate to form ion-rich regions with PEO chains incorporated in them and increase Tg significantly, and this is more pronounced with shorter PEO side chains where the abrupt increase in Tg occurs at lower ion content. When shorter PEO side chains are used, the flexibility of the polymer is restricted by the stiff polymer backbone, and the ion-dissociating ability of PEO is weakened that leads to more ionic aggregates. As the ion content of an ionomer increases, the conducting ion concentration and static dielectric constant is expected to increase until a limit is reached where the ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions restrict ionic mobility, and conducting ion concentration drop significantly. Moreover, in the comparison of a polycation system to a polyanion system with the counterions being analogs of the ions attached on the polymer, ether oxygen atoms solvate the free cations better than the attached cations. Last but not least, the incorporation of electron-deficient groups as anion receptors boosts the conducting ion concentration and static dielectric constant of the polycation system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3100], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jing-Han Helen", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "Helen", "first_name_ssi": "Jing-Han", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Thesis Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["PEO-based ionomers", "segmental relaxation", "electrode polarization", "ionic conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Conductivity, Morphology, and Dynamics of \nSingle-Ion Conducting Random and Block Copolymers\n", "id": "26467", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11384", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ionomers, where ionic groups are covalently bonded to the polymer backbone, have the potential application as both separator and electrolyte for cationic and anionic conducting rechargeable batteries. The chemical structure that provides the best ionic conductivities remains a challenging yet elusive goal, thus the structure-property relationship of single-ion conducting ionomers is thoroughly investigated in this study, using random copolymer ionomers with nonionic methacryl ethylene oxide as both polycation and polyanions, with the latter also made into block copolymers.\nRandom copolymer ionomers with ethylene oxide side chains are synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, to systematically test effects of ion content. Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) is used to measure the conductivity, dielectric constant and segmental relaxations in these ionomers and the electrode polarization at very low frequencies is used to assess the number density of simultaneously conducting ions and their mobility. Glass transition temperature (Tg) increases gradually as ions are incorporated at low ion content in polyethylene oxide-based styrene sulfonate ionomers then sharply as the ion content reaches 1:9 ion to ether oxygen (EO) ratio. The ionomer with 1:81 ion to EO ratio shows highest room temperature conductivity that results from the best combination of number density of simultaneously conducting ions and their mobility. Ion states are investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and can be related to dielectric measurements. The microphase separation that is anticipated in the ionomers with higher ion contents is probed by X-ray scattering and linear viscoelastic (LVE) measurements.\nPolycations with weak-binding aromatic phosphonium groups are also investigated with possible application for alkaline fuel cells and fluoride ion batteries. Tg broadens and increases with ion content (less than 1 oC per mol% of ionic comonomer), and the increase in Tg per mol% ion ionic monomer is much smaller than that for styrene sulfonate ionomers (~3 oC/mol%). The dynamics of these phosphonium ionomers are probed by LVE measurements, and two clear glassy relaxations can be seen in the LVE master curves though only one Tg is seen in differential scanning calorimetry that broadens with ion content.\nIn order to serve as both electrolyte and separator in rechargeable batteries, ionomers are required to exhibit both sufficient modulus and high ionic conductivity. However, good ionic conductivity is mostly correlated with low Tg materials where rapid segmental motion of the polymer aided ion transport, and decoupling of the electrical and mechanical properties of polymeric electrolytes is needed. By using poly(dimethylacrylamide) as the hard block with Tg=120 oC of ~50/50 diblock copolymer ionomers, the modulus is as high as 50 MPa at 60 oC for diblock copolymer ionomers with ~100 k and ~50 k molecular weights but decreases with ion content owing to more phase mixing. The ion containing poly(ethylene oxide)-based block, synthesized by RAFT polymerization, provides a low-Tg (~ -50 oC) medium for ion conduction. The conductivity of ionomeric diblock copolymers at 60 oC is ~2\u00d710^(-8) S/cm at ~10 mol% ionic monomer in the soft block (~10-6 S/cm at 60 oC for PEO-based random copolymers with similar ion content) and increases with increasing ion content, and polymer chain dynamics in the soft block are studied by DRS under an applied ac field.\nSmall amplitude oscillatory shear is not only used to detect the mechanical response to assess the modulus of the glassy block, but the low-frequency response in the LVE master curves is combined with X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy to probe the diblock copolymer morphology. The ~100 k molecular weight diblock copolymers exhibit lamellae morphology and longer range order is seen for the diblock copolymer with lowest ion content since the extent of phase mixing increases with ion content. No long range order can be observed in ~50 k molecular weight diblock copolymers, and the lowest molecular weight (~25 k) diblock copolymers are disordered at all temperatures studied.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10907], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jing-Han Helen", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "Helen", "first_name_ssi": "Jing-Han", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "Michael John Janik", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "James Patrick Runt", "Edward Patrick O'brien Jr.", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Karen I Winey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Edward Patrick O'brien Jr., Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Karen I Winey, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["single-ion conductors", "ionomers", "lithium ion battery", "block copolymer electrolyte", "ionic conductivity", "ion aggregation", "RAFT"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EXCHANGE TEACHERS\u2019 PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT  AND HOW THEIR EXPERIENCES IN THE USA AND CHINA INFLUENCE THEIR GLOBAL TEACHER IDENTITY", "id": "13606jxw475", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13606", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " This comparative dissertation explores exchange teachers\u2019 professional development and how their experiences in the USA and China influence their global teacher identity. When viewing teachers as adult and lifelong learners, their professional development is regarded as adult education. The importance of teacher\u2019s identity in understanding teaching as an occupation has been valued in existing literature. However, few connections have been made between teachers learning and how that affects their identity development, especially in cross-cultural settings. Although there has been an intuitive acceptance of the worth of the cross-cultural experience to individuals, professional development and teacher identity have not yet been well understood in a cross-cultural environment. \nThis study addresses three research questions: What is the relationship between exchange teachers\u2019 PDE and their global teacher identity? What are the tensions and conflicts that exchange teachers face in foreign countries and how is their PDE influenced by the tensions and conflicts? What are the differences and similarities between American and Chinese teachers\u2019 PDE in foreign countries? Based on the analysis of interviews, focus groups, and observation, the results of this comparative research study reveals that, through reflection and practice in a cross-cultural context that provokes tensions to challenge their identities, teachers were able to question themselves and their beliefs. This study shows that teacher identity reconstruction is a difficult and sometimes painful process. When emphasizing teachers as adult learners in cross-cultural exchange programs, informal learning experiences, such as classroom observation and interaction with local teachers and students, can impact teachers\u2019 understanding about who they are as teachers and how to better practice in teaching. \nBy investigating teacher\u2019s global identity formation closely, this study sheds light on understanding how overseas learning experiences can influence exchange teachers as lifelong learners and guide their future professional learning options. This study also underlines the importance of culture and diversity in teaching and offers the possibility of helping exchange teachers to understand effectively the teaching profession at a time of globalization. The study results highlight core concepts (comparison of educational differences, cross-cultural learning, pursuit of lifelong learning, conceptualization and reflection of a good teacher/teaching, job motivation, future perspectives of professional learning, and so on) that constitute the formation of global teacher identity of Chinese and American exchange teachers. \nThrough learning in a cross-cultural setting, teachers have been provided opportunities to be immersed in different cultural, social, and educational contexts. When studying teachers as adult and lifelong learners, this research suggests that the impetus for promoting and guiding their lifelong professional development is their knowledge and experiences through which their understanding and reflection about their professional identity are strengthened. \u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13738], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jinjie ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jinjie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ladislaus M.

Therefore, the proposed intrusion detection system can automatically generate signatures of zero-day attacks/worms which can be used to contain their spread in the future.\nMeanwhile, with the increasing flexibility in current networks, tons of new applications appear and begin to dominate the Internet. The newly emerging peer-to-peer applications, such as Bitcomet and Skype, can be responsible for more than 80% of the total traffic volume in the Internet. Therefore, it is essential for Internet service providers to correctly identify these new applications. This dissertation presents an efficient approach to identify Skype voice over IP (VoIP) traffic by using reliable statistical information. Because of its efficiency in both computational complexity and memory consumption, the new approach can be implemented on network backbone routers to identify Skype VoIP traffic in real-time.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3279], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jisheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jisheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller", "George Kesidis", "Nirmal K Bose", "Prasenjit Mitra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Chair", "Nirmal K Bose, Committee Member", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polymorphic Worms", "Voice over IP", "Data Digesting", "Application Classification", "Intrusion Detection System", "Network Anomaly Detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The origin of a basin-scale thin limestone: the Middle Devonian Cherry Valley Member, Marcellus Formation", "id": "25068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Petrology, geochemistry, stable isotopes and diagenetic signals were investigated to understand the origin and diagenetic process of the Cherry Valley member, a thin, basin-wide limestone interval within the Middle Devonian Marcellus Shale Formation. Three sub-members within the limestone interval were identified based on integrated petrological and geochemical analysis: 1) the lower facies is characterized by dark gray calcareous mudstone with pyritic lamiae parallel to bedding and abundant barite nodules; 2) the middle facies is marked with the massive black limestone section containing diverse fossil fragments; 3) the upper facies is characterized by grey calcareous mudstone or siltstone with pyritic lamination. Pyrite framboids size distribution, U-Mo covariance, and authigenic barite record the changing biogeochemistry dynamic and several diagenetic process, including barite concretion, methane oxidation, and barite to pyrite conversion. These diagenetic processes are controlled by redox dynamic and play an important role on the formation and alternation of this limestone interval. The depleted carbon isotopes, ranging from -10.2 to -2\u2030 VPDB, indicate a mixed signal between methane oxidation associated calcite and the seawater carbonate. The depletion of oxygen isotope spanning from -13.2 to -8.7\u2030 VPDB indicates a high temperature late diagenetic fluid overprint which is confirmed by low Sr/Ca ratios and properties of fluid inclusion in the veins. Petrological characteristics, geochemical proxies, isotopic compositions and fluid inclusion microthermometries are all consistent with the hypothesis that this carbonate member partially originated from methane oxidation and then underwent a high degree of high- temperature late diagenesis which altered the bulk isotopic composition. This integrated study demonstrated the depositional and diagenetic history of the Cherry Valley member from a geochemical point of view and illustrated that diagenetic process could contribute largely on the precipitation of carbonate within thick shale successions.

Meanwhile, new emerging non-volatile memory technologies (NVMs) are being explored, such as Phase-Change RAM (PCM or PCRAM), Spin-Torque Transfer RAM (STTRAM or MRAM), and Resistive RAM (ReRAM). They have common advantages of high density, low standby power and non-volatility. It could bring benefits by using NVMs to replace SRAM and DRAM in our memory systems. \n\nHowever, NVM technologies still have some disadvantages. First, the NVM write operation is much more expensive in terms of longer latency and higher energy. It causes negative impacts on the system performance and energy efficiency. Second, NVMs usually have limited write endurance, which brings challenges on system reliability. Last but not least, the size of NVM sense amplifier is larger, and how to maintain the area utilization is an issue. All of these NVM characteristics are caused by their basic mechanisms, and they are very difficult to be improved by changing cell designs. Therefore, new architecture techniques are necessary for mitigating these issues and building efficient and reliable systems with NVMs.\n\nIn this dissertation, NVMs are evaluated as alternatives of traditional memory technologies for different memory levels.

Specific materials of interests include a-Fe2O3 pigments, Ag/SiO2 core-shell structured nanocomposites and tabular SiO2 nanoparticles. The main focus was on the processing parameters related to the particulate morphologies, dispersion and optical properties of each model system and optimization of those conditions so that a general prediction for the optical behavior of the particulate materials was achievable. \nIron oxide (hematite) particles with various shapes (platelet, polyhedron, pseudocube and peanut-like) were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment of a Fe(OH)xOy precursor under various conditions. The size and shape of hematite particles could be adjusted by carefully controlling the processing parameters such as holding time, temperature and adsorption ions present in the system. The nearly monosized a-Fe2O3 platelets possessed face diameters of approximately 3 um and a thickness of 0.5 um under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The apparent color of the particles changed as particle size and shape varied. Munsell color notation was employed to compare the color of hematite particles with various size and shape. Diffuse reflectance spectra showed that a \u00a1\u00b0red-shift\u00a1\u00b1 of 40 nm was observed in platelet, pseudocube and peanut-like particles compared to conventional particles. The band at 850 nm for the 6A1 to 4T1 transition was split in the pseudocubic and peanut-like particles. Raman spectra of the hematite particles also revealed that the vibrational modes of a-Fe2O3 particles diminished as particle size decreased, and dependence of vibrational band intensity to frequency was also observed. The spectral profiles demonstrated significant difference as excitation lines changes from blue (457 nm) to red (647 nm). Unexpectedly, a weak near-infrared luminescence was observed for fine-particle a-Fe2O3 when excited by 1064 nm radiation from a Nd-YAG laser.  There were three broad luminescence peaks at 7994, 7225 and 6686 cm-1, with intensities about ten times that of the Raman scattering.  The relative intensities varied with particle morphology and with heat treatment.  Overall band intensities increased by about a factor of ten for Fe2O3 that has been heated to 500 Celsius and then decreased again for material that has been heated to 1000 Celsius.  The emission was assigned to the 4T1g to 6A1g crystal field transition of octahedral Fe3+.  A large Stokes shift is associated with these transitions. Possible mechanisms responsible for the optical properties of hematite particles were postulated based on the findings of the experiments.\nNanoscale Ag/SiO2 composite particles with a uniform core-shell structure were synthesized by reverse micelle techniques. The silver cluster was about 5 nm and the silica shell thickness was 10 nm when R=2 (R=[water]/[surfactant]), H=100 (H=[water]/[TEOS]) and X=1 (X= [NH4OH]/[TEOS]) was employed for the cyclohexane/Igepal/water tertiary system. A model calculation indicated that the optical properties of the nanocomposites, especially the refractive index for core-shell structured nanoparticles were governed by the ratio of the core to the shell. The spherical nanocomposite particles were washed and concentrated with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in order to remove the surfactant added during synthesis. Spherical SiO2 submicron particles were packed in the HPLC column as a stationary phase for the washing and dispersing of Ag/SiO2 nanocomposite particles. Surface modification of Ag/SiO2 nanocomposite particles with the silane coupling agent 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS) enhanced the charge of the nanoparticles and improved the efficiency of washing with HPLC. Well-dispersed Ag/SiO2 stable suspensions were successfully attained with ethanol water mixed solvent after HPLC washing based on dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and spin coat/atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis. As a comparison, other conventional methods such as centrifugation, soxhlet extraction and sedimentation were tested and failed to produce well-dispersed Ag/SiO2 nanocomposite suspensions. The states of the Ag/SiO2 dispersion were assessed with pH control and average agglomeration number (AAN) analysis. The hypothesis of nanoscale dispersion was evaluated through the washing of Ag/SiO2 nanocomposite particles with HPLC. \nAmorphous tabular SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized from the self-assembled octylamine/water bilayer via a template-directed growth mechanism. Morphology of the tabular SiO2 nanoparticles was analyzed by high-resolution TEM both for room temperature dried and calcined powders. The tabular SiO2 nanoparticles demonstrated well-defined thickness (4-6 nm) with a relative spread face diameter (100-300 nm), which lead to a wide distribution of aspect ratio based on AFM. High surface area up to 1158 m2/g was readily obtained with a very uniform micropore size of about 0.63 nm after thermal treatment at 700 Celsius for 2 hours. Metallic Pd clusters were embedded into the microporous SiO2 matrix via a solution reduction of Pd(NO3)2 by hydrazine hydrate. The infiltration of 33 wt% Pd leads to a 13 % porosity loss of tabular SiO2 nanoparticles. The presence of Pd in the pores was demonstrated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The metallic guest species presumably resided in the accessible micropores with an estimated size about 1.3 nm. Hydrogen uptake measurements were performed for the Pd infiltrated nanocomposites. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3102], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "William Blaine White", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Erwin A Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "William Blaine White, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanocomposite", "Nanoparticle", "Optical properties", "Synthesis", "Dispersion", "Hematite"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Quantitative Study of Stoichiometric Proton Imbalance in Phototrophic Algal Growth", "id": "19118", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8586", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The high production of algae based biofuel requires high density of algae culture.

Besides, the associated impact is becoming larger and larger, ranging from millions of stolen credit card numbers to innumerous Web servers vulnerable and waiting for an emergency security patch.\n\nIn this dissertation, we perform a three-dimensional research study emphasizing on protecting server programs and systems, including privilege separation, attack surface reduction, and risk assessment.\n\nFirst, we explore applying privilege separation to enhance the security of server programs. We design and implement Arbiter, a runtime system targeting at fine-grained privilege separation in multithreaded server programs. In Arbiter, different principal threads can have different privileges to access shared data objects so that the compromise or malfunction of one thread does not lead to data contamination or data leakage of another thread. We leverage page table protection bits and devise a new memory allocation mechanism to achieve efficient reference monitoring. Programmers specify security policy through annotating the source code.\n\nSecond, reducing attack surface is an effective preventive measure to strengthen security in large-scale server systems. We propose an automated approach to accurately detect the idling (most likely unused) services and provide ways to reduce their attack surface. We implement this idea and deploy our system in a real working environment of a mid-sized enterprise to identify and constrain unused services that expose attack surface.\n\nFinally, given a server program or system, it is important to evaluate the effectiveness of different security settings and understand the security risks of potential vulnerabilities.

The second part of this work focuses on the implementation of such metabolism based pH control strategy in both laboratory scale and commercial outdoor scale algae production using facilities in Arizona Center of Algae Technology and Innovation (AzCATI). The outdoor field test shows that: compared with current on demand CO2 buffering control method, metabolism based pH control method could achieve long term stable pH while using only one order of magnitude lower CO2 supply rate. In both cases, culture pH could be maintained at a desired level, however different scales do show significant differences: the pH in the laboratory scale flask can be managed at a much more precise level due to little fluctuation in a well controlled lab cultivation environment while the outdoor production system has fairly high fluctuations with only metabolic pH control since the whole process of outdoor system is inevitably subject to the change of weather and solar cycle.

However, the formation and evolution of massive\nstars themselves and how their low-mass siblings are affected in the\nwind-swept and UV-radiation-dominated environment are not well\nunderstood. Much of the stellar populations inside of the massive star\nforming regions (MSFRs) are poorly studied in the optical and IR\nwavelengths because of observational challenges caused by large\ndistance, high extinction, and heavy contamination from unrelated\nsources. Although it has long been recognized that X-rays open a new\nwindow to sample the young stellar populations residing in the MSFRs,\nthe low angular resolution of previous generation X-ray telescopes has\nlimited the outcome from such studies. The sensitive high spatial\nresolution X-ray observations enabled by the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory and the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) have\nsignificantly improved our ability to study the X-ray-emitting\npopulations in the MSFRs in the last few years.\n\nIn this thesis, I analyzed seven high spatial resolution Chandra/ACIS\nimages of two massive star forming complexes, namely the NGC 6357\nregion hosting the 1~Myr old Pismis 24 cluster (Chapter 3) and the\nRosette Complex including the 2~Myr old NGC~2244 cluster immersed in\nthe Rosette Nebula (Chapter 4), embedded clusters in the Rosette\nMolecular Cloud (RMC; Chapter 5), and a triggered cluster NGC 2237\n(Chapter 6). The X-ray sampled stars were studied in great\ndetails. The unique power of X-ray selection of young stellar cluster\nmembers yielded new knowledge in the stellar populations, the cluster\nstructures, and the star formation histories.\n\nThe census of cluster members is greatly improved in each region. A\nlarge fraction of the X-ray detections have optical or near-infrared\n(NIR) stellar counterparts (from 2MASS, SIRIUS and FLAMINGOS JHK\nimages), most of which are previously uncatalogued young cluster\nmembers. This provides a reliable probe of the rich intermediate-mass\nand low-mass young stellar populations accompanying the massive OB\nstars in each region. For example, In the poorly-studied NGC 6357\nregion, our study increased the number of known members from optical\nstudy by a factor of 40.  As a result, normal initial mass functions\n(IMFs) for NGC 6357 and NGC~2244 were found, inconsistent with the\ntop-heavy IMFs suspected in previous optical studies. The observed\nX-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) in NGC 6357 and NGC 2244 are\ncompared to the Orion Nebula Cluster XLF, yielding the first estimate\nof NGC 6357's total cluster population, a few times the known Orion\npopulation. For NGC 2244, a total population of 2000 X-ray-emitting\nstars is derived, consistent with previous estimate from IR studies.\n\nThe morphologies and spatial structures of the clusters are\ninvestigated with absorption-stratified stellar surface density\nmaps. Small-scale substructures superposed on the spherical clusters\nare found in NGC 6357 and NGC 2244. Both of their radial stellar\ndensity profiles show a power-law cusp around the density peak\nsurrounded by an isothermal sphere. In NGC 2244, the spatial\ndistribution of X-ray stars is strongly concentrated around the\ncentral O5 star, HD 46150. The other O4 star HD 46223 has few\ncompanions. The X-ray sources in the RMC show three distinctive\nstructures and substructures within them, which include previously\nknown embedded IR clusters and a new unobscured cluster (RMC A). We do\nnot find clear evidence of sequentially triggered formation. The\nconcentration of X-ray identified young stars implies that <35% of\nstars could be in a distributed population throughout the RMC region\nand clustered star formation is the dominant mode in this cloud. The\nNGC 2237 cluster, similar to RMC A, may have formed from collapse of\npre-existing massive molecular clumps accompanying the formation of\nthe NGC 2244 cluster. The spatial distribution of the NIR counterparts\nto X-ray stars in the optical dark region northwest of NGC 2237 show\nlittle evidence of triggered star formation in the pillar objects.\n\nThe observed inner disk fraction in the MSFRs as indicated by K-band\nexcess appears lower than the IR-excess disk fractions found in the\nnearby low-mass star formation regions of similar age.  An overall\nK-excess disk frequency of 6% for X-ray selected stars in the\nintermediate- to high-mass range in the NGC 6357 region (Chapter 3),\nand 10% for stars with mass M > 2Msun in NGC 2244 (Chapter 4) are\nderived, which indicates that the inner disks around higher-mass stars\nevolve more rapidly. The X-ray stars in these regions provide an\nimportant new sample for studies of intermediate-mass PMS stars that\nare not accreting, in addition to the accreting HAeBe stars. The low\nK-excess disk frequency for X-ray selected stars in the solar mass\nrange in NGC 2244 is intriguing, which may be attributed to different\nsensitivities to disk materials, selection effects between X-ray\nsamples and IR samples and/or faster disk dissipation due to\nphotoevaporation in the MSFRs.\n\nX-ray properties of stars across the mass spectrum are\npresented. Diversities in the X-ray spectra of O stars are seen, both\nsoft X-ray emission consistent with the micro-shocks in stellar winds\nand hard X-ray components signifying magnetically confined winds or\nclose binarity.  X-ray luminosities for a sample of stars earlier than\nB4 in NGC 6357, NGC 2244, and M 17 confirm the long-standing\nlogLx/Lbol ~ -7 relation, although larger scatter is seen among the\nLx/Lbol ratios of B-type stars. Low-mass PMS stars frequently show\nX-ray flaring, including intense flares with luminosities above\nLx>1E+32 ergs/s. Diffuse X-ray emission is present in the NGC 6357\nregion and in the NGC 2244 cluster. The derived luminosity of diffuse\nemission in NGC 6357 is consistent with the integrated emission from\nthe unresolved PMS stars. The NGC 2244 diffuse emission is likely\noriginated from the wind termination shocks, and hence is truly\ndiffuse in nature.\n\nIn summary, Chandra X-ray observations offer multifaceted\napproaches to study the young stellar clusters in MSFRs in\ndepth. Future perspectives with the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-IR\nobservations for a systematic measurement of disk frequencies in X-ray\nsampled massive clusters and X-ray observations of the earliest phases\nof massive star formation are discussed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3095], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Junfeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junfeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric D Feigelson", "Leisa K Townsley", "Kevin Luhman", "Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Donald P Schneider", "Richard Alan Wade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric D Feigelson, Committee Chair", "Leisa K Townsley, Committee Member", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Member", "Hiroshi Ohmoto, Committee Member", "Donald P Schneider, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["star formation", "X-rays", "star cluster", "initial mass function"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving the quality of Cvd graphene based devices and transport studies of few-layer Wse2", "id": "26576", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11824", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of two main topics: a) advances on the synthesis and quality of chemical vapor deposited graphene and devices; b) electrical and thermoelectrical transport studies of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), in particular few-layer WSe2. \n\nChapter 1 introduces the band structures of graphene and TMDC, as well as the novel physics and potential applications of both materials.\n\nChapter 2 describes the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) synthesis of graphene on copper using gaseous precursors of methane and hydrogen.

We obtain the crystal structure of WSe2 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-Ray diffraction (XRD). The layer number-dependent intensity ratio of two Raman modes (2LA and A1g) is studied and used to identify the layer number in few-layer WS2. The size of the direct band gap (monolayer) and indirect band gap (few-layer to bulk) of WSe2 is obtained from photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. In monolayer WSe2, the width of the A-exciton emission peak decreases with decreasing temperature and saturates at low temperatures to around 15 meV, demonstrating good sample quality. PL spectra of ion irradiated WS2 reveal additional emissions attributed to defect-bound excitons. Various atomic force microscopy (AFM) based imaging techniques, such as topographic AFM, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), and scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) are employed to study the morphology, work function and thermal conductivity of few-layer WSe2 and WSxSe2-x alloys. These studies provide valuable information on the physical properties of the TMDC materials.\n\nChapter 4 focuses on the electrical transport properties of few-layer WSe2 field-effect transistors. We study the gate-dependent conductance of the transistor in the subthreshold regime and demonstrate that the resistance of the Schottky barrier contacts dominates the two-terminal resistance. The transmission mechanism through the contact is found to be thermionic field emission (TFE), which arises from a large amount of impurity states inside the band gap. Applying the TFE model, we self-consistently determine the density of the impurity states to be approximately 1~2\u00d7\u301610\u3017^13  cm2/eV. We determine these impurity states are due to internal contributions rather than originating from the substrate by comparing devices fabricated on different substrates. The large number of impurity states leads to high mobility-edge carrier density (~ 1.1\u00d71013 /cm2 in our devices) and low carrier mobility (~ 200 cm2V-1s-1 in our devices), Our studies shed light on the electrical transport properties of TMDC materials and highlight the material quality challenge of the field.   \n\nChapter 5 presents preliminary thermoelectric transport study of few-layer WSe2. Using micro-patterned thermometer and heaters, we obtain preliminary results on the Seebeck coefficient of a 5-layer WSe2 device.  The magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient increases as the Fermi level is increased towards the conduction band edge and exceeds 200 \u00b5V/K at high carrier densities. \n\nChapter 6 summarizes the studies discussed in this dissertation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11277], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Junjie ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junjie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Zhu", "Jun Zhu", "Eric W Hudson", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Eric W Hudson, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Graphene", "CVD", "Transition metal dichalcogenides", "Schottky barrier", "Thermionic field emission"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Automatically Extracting Semantic Scholarly Entities from Academic Papers", "id": "13336kuw176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13336", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis defines a new type of named entity\u2013 Semantic Scholarly Entity, which refers to the noun phrases in academic papers that deliver domain specific knowledge.

This test is consistent, and has nontrivial power against $sqrt{n}$ -local alternatives.\n\nTo avoid numerical evaluation of the conditional characteristic function of the model distribution, a simulated integrated conditional moment (SICM) test is proposed, where each theoretical conditional characteristic function is replaced by a simulated counterpart, based on a single random drawing from the corresponding conditional distribution.

The focus is on how to include the spatial effects of observed house prices into a hedonic model and selecting a suitable spatial model. Several popular spatial models are considered. I argue that, based on theoretical grounds, the spatial error components (SEC) specification provides a better model for house price than the spatial lag model and the SAR error model. I also question the \u00a1\u00b0convention\u00a1\u00b1 of row-standardizing the spatial weights matrix in practice and discuss its implications within each of these spatial models. An empirical application is conducted using a large dataset on house sales near three landfills. To illustrate and justify the arguments, I estimate the impacts that these different landfills have on nearby house prices using several spatial models. My claims are supported by the large-sample empirical evidence.\n\nThe second component investigates issues related to estimation of the impact of privately-owned and developable open space on nearby house prices. Because privately-owned and developable open space is considered as a part of the residential market, its level responds to area house prices. As a result, an endogeneity problem arises in the hedonic regression model of house price as the house price and surrounding open space are simultaneously determined. The usual approach to deal with this endogeneity is to use IV/2SLS estimation. I propose a new approach that improves on IV/2SLS in two ways. First, in addition to the hedonic modeling of house price, a dynamic process of open space conversion is modeled to include more information, resulting in a simultaneous-equation model. Second, based on the arguments made in the first component, the SEC specification is applied to both equations of the model to incorporate the spatial effects embedded in neighboring house prices and neighboring open spaces. As a result, a nonlinear spatial simultaneous-equation model is suggested to estimating the marginal implicit price of developable open spaces around properties. The estimation results show that the house buyers of the two areas have distinct preference of surrounding land uses of properties. In addition, people only appreciate the amenity effect of open space that is protected from future development.\n\nThese two components are related with each other in the sense that the first component establishes a methodology basis for estimating spatial hedonic property value model; the second one comes with an empirical application to modeling spatial effects of neighboring open space (and neighboring house price). Both are to contribute to the application of spatial econometrics in estimating hedonic pricing model.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3844], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard C Ready", "James Samuel Shortle", "Kathryn Jo Brasier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard C Ready, Committee Chair", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member", "Kathryn Jo Brasier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spatial econometrics", "hedonic property value mode", "open space"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Gallium Nitride-based Electronic and Optoelectronic devices", "id": "24758", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For the past decade, Gallium nitride (GaN) material system has earned a significant place in modern power electronic and optoelectronic devices due to its outstanding electric and optical properties. GaN-based device technologies have improved substantially, and are still investigated intensely for advanced performance. The GaN-based devices studied in this dissertation involve Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) and high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) on the electronic side and light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the optoelectronic side.\nIn the SBDs part, GaN SBDs with high voltage blocking capability and low on-state voltage on inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etched commercial LED epi-wafers are studied. Their applications in alternating current (AC) LEDs are demonstrated. It is revealed that the potassium hydroxide (KOH) pretreatment with optimized concentration could eliminate the leakage current due to the reduction of the ICP induced surface defects. Moreover, the numerical values of the surface defect density are extracted by analyzing the leakage current mechanism. \nIn the HEMTs part, the transfer saturation feature of GaN-based HEMTs is investigated firstly. It is observed that the drain current in HEMTs with short gate length becomes saturation as gate bias approaches zero. The theoretical analysis based on a simple series resistance model reveals this saturation feature results from the fact that the total source-drain resistance is independent on gate bias in a short gate length HMET. This conclusion is further verified by device simulation study. Secondly, novel GaN double-gate (DG) HEMTs featuring enhanced back gate-control of the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in AlGaN/GaN heterostructures is designed and modeled. The results indicate that the DG GaN-HEMTs can provide a higher maixmum transconductance gain and better immunity of the short channel effects than traditional single-gate HEMTs. At last, the temperature-dependent electrical characteristics of GaN-based HEMTs from room temperature down to 50K are studied. It is observed that the drain saturation current and transconductance increase with the decrease of the temperature. \nIn the LEDs part, quantum dots (QDs) coupled non-resonant microcavity light emitting diodes (LEDs) with micro-holes is designed and demonstrated to enhance non-radiative energy transfer between InGaN/GaN quantum wells (QWs) and QDs for the first time by tailoring the radiative relaxation lifetime of excitations in QWs. The blue emission from the InGaN/GaN QWs is detuned from the resonant modes of the microcavity to extend the radiative recombination lifetime in QWs. The direct contact of QDs and the QWs active layer is achieved by depositing QDs into the micro-holes on the LEDs. This non-resonant microcavity structure leads to a 3.2 times enhancement of the effective quantum efficiency of QDs in microcavity LEDs than the LEDs without microcavity structure.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10356], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu", "Jian Xu", "Michael T Lanagan", "Samia A Suliman", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jian Xu, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Samia A Suliman, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gallium nitride", "schottky barrier diodes", "high electron mobility transistors", "light emitting diodes"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Effects Of Monounsaturated Fatty Acid-enriched Diets With And Without Avocados On Cardio-metabolic Risk Factors", "id": "25111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dietary guidance recommends a healthy dietary pattern that is low in saturated fat (SFA) to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a primary target for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction.  Using either carbohydrates (CHO) or unsaturated fat to replace saturated fat in an average American diet may achieve a similar reduction in LDL-C, but a high intake of dietary CHO may increase triglycerides (TG), lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and increase small, dense LDL, along with promoting insulin resistance thereby increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.  These cardio-metabolic risk factors also are targets for dietary intervention to achieve a greater CVD risk reduction.  When SFA is replaced with unsaturated fat, the predominant fatty acid class is monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) because the recommended intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is less than 10% of energy.  Overall, the substitution of MUFA instead of CHO (especially refine grains and added sugar) for SFA calories may favorably affect other lipid risk factors of CVD. \nThe oxidative modification of LDL particles is a key factor in the initial process of atherosclerosis.  Dietary antioxidant vitamins, polyphenols, and other bioactive compounds from foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables) have been a focus of nutrition because of their role in improving antioxidant status and lowering LDL oxidation.  Identifying foods that can beneficially improve multiple cardio-metabolic risk factors is needed for the primary prevention of CVD.  \nAvocados are a nutrient-dense source of MUFA, rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols.  It is unclear whether avocados affect cardio-metabolic risk factors beyond their fatty acid profile.  This dissertation investigated the effects of a MUFA enriched moderate fat diets including one avocado per day on established and novel cardio-metabolic risk factors.  \n A randomized, cross-over, controlled feeding trial was conducted with 45 healthy overweight/obese participants with baseline LDL-C levels in the 25-90th percentile.  After a 2 week run-in average American diet (34% fat, 13% SFA, 11% MUFA, 51% carbohydrate, 16% protein) at baseline, three cholesterol-lowering diets (6-7% SFA) were fed (5 weeks each) with a random sequence: a lower-fat diet (LF: 24% fat, 7% SFA, 11% MUFA, 9% PUFA, 59% carbohydrate, 16-17% protein); and two moderate fat diets matched for macronutrients and fatty acids (34% fat, 6% SFA, 17% MUFA, 9% PUFA, 49% carbohydrate, 16-17% protein): the avocado diet included one fresh Hass avocado (136 g) per day, and the moderate fat diet provided mostly the same foods (as the avocado diet) but used high oleic acid oils and low fat dairy products to match the fatty acid profile of  one avocado.  All three cholesterol-lowering diets met current dietary recommendations on macronutrient percentage range and the serving amount for each food group.  Specifically, the grain product in the lower fat diet contained more than half whole grains, which meets current dietary guidelines. \nCompared to baseline, all three diets decreased total cholesterol and LDL-C (p<0.001 for all).  The LF diet significantly increased TG (20.8mg/dL, p<0.0001) and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C, 2.6mg/dL, p=0.0003), while the AV and MF diets did not. There was a greater HDL-C decrease on the LF diet versus the AV and MF diets (p=0.03 and 0.04, respectively).  The reduction in LDL-C and non-HDL cholesterol on the AV diet (-13.5mg/dL, -14.6 mg/dL) was greater (p=0.04 and 0.01) than the MF (-8.3 mg/dL, -8.7 mg/dL) and LF (-7.4 mg/dL, -4.8 mg/dL) diets.  Furthermore, only the AV diet significantly decreased LDL particle number (LDL-P, -80.1nmol/L, p=0.0001), small dense LDL cholesterol (LDL3+4, -4.1 mg/dL, p=0.04), and the ratio of LDL/HDL (-6.6%, p<0.001).  In addition, compared to baseline, only the AV diet decreased oxidized-LDL (-7.0 U/L, -8.8%, p=0.0004) while the LF diet (-1.6 U/L p=0.1) and the MF diet (-3.2 U/L, p=0.2) did not.  Oxidized-LDL after consumption of the AV diet was significantly lower (p=0.05 and 0.03) than the MF diet and LF diet.  HPLC analysis showed that only the AV diet increased plasma lutein by 68.7% from baseline (p<0.0001).  The increase in lutein in response to the AV diet was significantly greater than the increase by the MF (21.1%, p=0.7) and LF (37.6%, p=0.1) diets.  Both MF and AV diets significantly increased plasma \u03b1-carotene (72.8% and 68.4%, p<0.01 for both) and \u03b2-carotene (15.4% and 12%, p<0.05 for both) compared to baseline.  The LF diet did not elicit changes in plasma antioxidant vitamins, except for a decrease in \u03b3-tocopherol (-7.8%, p=0.03).  Interestingly, the change of oxidized-LDL was significantly correlated with the change in small LDL-P (r=0.32, p=0.0002) and small, dense LDL-C (r=0.47, p<0.0001) by not large LDL-P (r=0.15, p=0.09) or large, buoyant LDL-C (r=-0.03, p=0.8).\nOverall, our results showed that a high MUFA, moderate fat diet elicits a more favorable blood lipid profile compared to a lower fat, high carbohydrate diet.  Furthermore, the inclusion of one avocado per day as part of a moderate fat, cholesterol-lowering diet has additional benefits on lowering LDL-C, LDL-P, non-HDL-C, small, dense LDL, and oxidized LDL, and increasing plasma lutein.  The change in oxidized LDL by the avocado diet may be due to its effect on lowering small, dense LDL.  Our results demonstrate that avocados have beneficial effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors that extend beyond their cardio-protective fatty acid profile.  Avocados are a source of many cardio-protective nutrients and further larger, long-term clinical studies are warranted to evaluate their role in primary and secondary CVD prevention.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10369], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Joshua D Lambert", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Michael Thomas Green", "Mosuk Chow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["avocado", "antioxidant", "CVD", "LDL-C", "lipid", "lipoprotein", "metabolic syndrome", "MUFA", "nutrition", "oxidation", "small dense LDL."]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Understanding The Effects Of Mineral Spatial Distributions On Chromium Sorption and Calcite Dissolutoin In Porous Media", "id": "26408", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11517", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study of sorption-desorption and dissolution-precipitation in the natural subsurface is of fundamental interest in many areas of scienti\ufb01c, industrial and engineering processes, including environmental contaminant transport, leaching of agrochemicals from soil surface to groundwater, chemical weathering, enhanced oil or gas recovery and CO2 sequestration. The natural subsurface is highly heterogeneous with minerals distributed in different spatial patterns. Knowledge of how mineral spatial distributions regulate sorption and dissolution processes is important for understanding and modelling the transport and fate of chemicals. However, most published studies about the sorption and dissolution reactions were carried out in well-mixed batch reactors or uniformly packed columns, few data are available on the effects of spatial heterogeneities on the overall reaction rates. The objective of this work is 1) to examine the largely unexplored role of illite spatial distribution patterns in dictating sorption of Cr(VI), a ubiquitously occurring contaminant in Hanford, Oak Ridge, Los Alamos and other sites, 2) to systematically understand and quantify the effects of calcite spatial patterns on its dissolution rates under various reactivity conditions. \nFlow-through experiments were carried out at 0.1-18.5 m/day using columns packed with the same illite or calcite and quartz mass however with different patterns and permeability contrasts. Two-dimensional reactive transport modeling was used to reproduce the experimental data and to extrapolate the model under a wide range of conditions. For Cr(VI) sorption, at 0.6 and 3.0 m/day, well-connected low permeability illite zone oriented in the flow-parallel direction leads to diffusion-controlled mass transport limitation for accessing sorption sites. This results in up to 1.4 order of magnitude lower macrocapacity and macrorates compared to those in minimally-connected columns with well-mixed illite and quartz. At 15.0 m/day, the e\ufb00ects of spatial heterogeneities are less signi\ufb01cant (up to a factor of 2.8) owing to the close to chemical kinetics-controlled condition. Additional patterns with the same permeability mean but different \uf0732 lnK (variance of lnK) of 4.5 and 0.2 were generated by Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) at different correlation lengths and column lengths. Sorption capacity and rates decrease with correlation length and transport connectivity, quantitative measures of heterogeneity characteristics. For calcite dissolution, calcite dissolution rates in the 1-zone columns are lower than those in the Mixed columns for all conditions due to the mass transport limitation. The spatial patterns make negligible effects under too low or too high flow velocities due to the equilibrium or kinetic-controlled regimes. At high local dissolution rate conditions (pH <4.0, large surface area or fast dissolving mineral), the \u201ccritical\u201d flow region where the effects of spatial heterogeneities are significant is broad and locates at high flow conditions (>10.0 m/d). In contrast, the \u201ccritical\u201d region is narrow and locates at low flow conditions (< 0.1 m/d). \nMineral spatial distributions have profound impacts on sorption and dissolution rates. Understanding these processes are of great importance for many applications in environmental and geological systems. Insights gained here bridge gaps between laboratory and field application in hydrogeology and geochemistry fields, and advance predictive understanding of reactive transport processes in the natural heterogeneous subsurface. Furthermore, identifying the key geochemical conditions where spatial heterogeneities influence the sorption and dissolution rates most provides useful information for adsorbent industrial application, landfill design, chemical weathering and acidization design during energy extraction. \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11028], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Li Li", "Li Li", "Jeffrey Brownson", "Eugene C Morgan", "Sridhar Komarneni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Li Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Li Li, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Brownson, Committee Member", "Eugene C Morgan, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spatial pattern", "Cr(VI) sorption", "Dissolution", "Heterogeneity", "Connectivity", "reactive transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "DETAILED CHEMISTRY, SOOT, AND RADIATION CALCULATIONS IN TURBULENT REACTING FLOWS", "id": "6203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3911", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present work aims at a comprehensive approach for the simulation of\nturbulent reacting flows.

The issues regarding soot calculations include\n%current understanding of the sooting processes, the models of the\n%sooting processes, and the application of the models to turbulent flames.\n%The issues regarding radiation calculations\n%include the difficulties of the radiation calculations, the solution methods\n%of radiative transfer equations, the evaluations of radiative properties of\n%both gas-phase species and soot particles, the interactions between\n%turbulence and radiation, and the modeling approaches for the interactions.\nTwo detailed models of turbulent combustion are developed using state-of-the-art \nmodels of detailed chemistry, soot, and radiation calculations in turbulent flames. One of\nthe models is based on an empirical description of the turbulent flow\nfield and the other is based on CFD modeling of the flow field. \n\nThe empirical-description-based model is an\nextension of Two-Stage Lagrangian (TSL) model of turbulent jet flames.\nThis extension includes\nthe incorporation of a detailed soot model and the improvement of the\nradiation model. The soot model is a detailed one adopted from Appel-Bockhorn-Frenklach's\nsoot model. The dynamics of soot particles are described by the method of moments adapted \nto the TSL formulation. The  original constant-emissivity radiation model is improved by\nsolving the radiative transfer equation on the spatial configuration of the TSL model using\nthe spherical harmonic P1 method and the discrete ordinate S2 method. The gray\nmedium assumption is employed and the Planck-mean absorption coefficient is used to\ndetermine the radiative properties of both gas-phase species and soot particles.\nWith the extended TSL model, the characteristics of soot, radiation and NOx emissions\nin oxygen-enriched flames are studied.  \n\nThe CFD-based model\nis based on an engineering CFD code (GMTEC) and it solves the compressible flow equations\non unstructured meshes. GMTEC is extended\nby incorporating a detailed chemistry model, a detailed soot model, and a detailed\nradiation model. The detailed chemistry model is based on the use of the CHEMKIN libraries, and\nthe calculations of chemistry are accelerated by using the ISAT software. The effective use\nof ISAT for detailed chemistry in nonhomogeneous systems is outlined. The\ndetailed soot model is adopted from Frenklach's detailed soot model with the method of\nmoments. It is coupled to the three-dimensional CFD code through transport equations of\nsoot moments. Two detailed radiation models are implemented, the P1-gray model\nand the  P1-FSK model. Both models employ the spherical harmonic P1 method\nfor the solution of the radiative transfer equation\non three-dimensional unstructured meshes. The P1-gray model employs the gray medium\nassumption and Planck mean absorption coefficient for radiative property evaluations.\nThe P1-FSK model addresses the nongray nature of the radiative heat transfer\nby using the full-spectrum k-distribution method.\nThe CFD-based comprehensive model is then exercised to simulated an oxygen-enriched flame.\n\nThe two detailed models developed have proven to be successful in the simulation of \noxygen-enriched turbulent flames. The advantage of the TSL model is its computational\neconomy. It is shown to be capable of predicting the general trends of soot, radiation, \nand NOx emission with oxygen index, fuel type, and initial jet velocity, but it \nfailed to provide quantitative predictions of flame structure due to its simplistic \ntreatment of the hydrodynamics. \n\nThe advantage of the CFD-based model is its capability of performing \ndetailed, quantitative predictions and of capturing the strong couplings among soot, \nradiation, flame structure, and NOx emissions in oxygen-enriched flames. It can be\nused to identify the key sensitivities in soot and NOx formations, to study\nthe effects of nongray gas-phase and soot radiation, and to study the influence of\nmixing, fuel type, and oxygen index on the soot formation, NOx emission, and\nthermal radiation characteristics of oxygen-enriched turbulent flames. \nThe deficiencies of the CFD-based model include the simple\nturbulent combustion model, neglect of turbulent fluctuations in composition and\ntemperature, and the P1 approximation used to solve the RTE. These are the subjects\nof ongoing research.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3884], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Liangyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liangyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard C Benson", "Robert John Santoro", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Stephen R Turns", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard C Benson, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["oxygen-enriched combustion", "thermal radiation", "soot modeling", "detailed chemistry", "turbulent combustion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "COMPUTATIONAL STUDY ON SENSORY MOTOR INTEGRATION AND SENSORY SEQUENCE LEARNING IN SONGBIRD HVC\n\n", "id": "10256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3912", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Intracellular recording shows HVCRA neurons in songbirds have strong selective response to the bird\u2019s own song. This selectivity is especially sensitive to the sequential order of the syllables spanning over several hundred milliseconds. The firing pattern of HVCRA is sparse in the sense that each HVCRA neuron only fires at most once during one motif and has such precise timing that it always gives a burst of spikes lasting around 10 ms. Developed from a song production model using synfire chains, we incorporate the sensory input into the spike propagation process by coincident detection of sensory input from upstream and lateral input inside the synfire chain. The specific wiring structure from sensory input to the synfire chain embeds the sensory sequence which can be recognized by our model. This specific structure can be learned from initial all-to-all weak connections with a postsynaptic voltage dependent learning mechanism. The stability of this model is shown by the robust performances of both recognition and learning under different synaptic noises and various defects in training sequence.  In order to handle repetitive inputs, Potassium A-current is induced into our model to check the current surge due to repetitive inputs. The working region and its effect on the sequence recognition of A-current are investigated and its limited role on the single compartment model is concluded. In order to construct a more biological model and leave more room for A-current, the two-compartment model of a single HVCRA neuron replaces the single compartment model of the integrate-fire neuron. A more popular learning mechanism (spike-timing dependent plasticity) is applied to induce the specific wiring from sensory neurons to synfire chain neurons. The sequence recognition and learning of this revised network are studied. The enhanced robustness is partly due to the enlargement of the coincident region by A-current.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3885], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Linli ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Linli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dezhe Jin", "Dezhe Jin", "John C Collins", "Gong Chen", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dezhe Jin, Dissertation Advisor", "Dezhe Jin, Committee Chair", "John C Collins, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational", "songbird", "HVC", "sequence", "recognition", "learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Augmented Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ASPSA) for Discrete Supply Chain Inventory Optimization Problems", "id": "7328", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3937", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, simulation optimization has attracted a lot of attention because simulation can model the real systems in fidelity and capture the dynamics of the systems.

Extensive tests show that ASPSA achieves speedup and improves solution quality. ASPSA is also shown to converge. For unconstrained problems ASPSA uses random presearch whereas for constrained problems presearch search is used to find a feasible solution, thereby extending the gradient based approach. Performance of ASPSA is tested for supply chain inventory optimization problems including serial and fork-join supply chain without constraints and fork-join supply chain network with customer service level constraints. To evaluated performance of ASPSA, a na\u00efve implementation of Genetic Algorithm is used to primarily test solution quality and indicate computation effort.

However, a significant problem for AEMs is long-lasting performance and robust materials stability under fuel cell and electrolyzer conditions. Block copolymers based on styrene having pendent trimethyl styrenylbutyl ammonium (containing 4 methylene groups between the ionic moieties and the aromatic rings) or benzyltrimethyl ammonium groups were synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation radical (RAFT) polymerization. The stability under basic conditions of the block copolymers were evaluated under severe, accelerated conditions. The block copolymer with C4 side chain trimethyl styrenylbutyl ammonium motifs displayed improved stability compared to the benzyltrimethyl ammonium-based AEM at 80\u00b0C.\n\nThe AEMs obtained from polystyrene based block copolymers are brittle yet highly swollen in liquid water, thus hampering their study in fuel cell devices. However, crosslinked copolymer AEMs based on poly(vinylbenzyl chloride)-b-poly(butenylstyrene) copolymers using a low temperature olefin metathesis crosslinking route were self-supporting robust membranes. The covalent crosslinking afforded robust mechanical properties in dry materials and low water uptake and small dimensional changes for the hydrated membranes. The crosslinked membranes showed good ionic conductivity when in contact with liquid water, but had lower conductivity than samples of non-crosslinked AEMs at any given relative humidity hydration condition. The morphologies of crosslinked AEMs as investigated by SAXS correlated with their conductivity values. The ionic conductivity of crosslinked samples decreased due to the disruption of ionic domains during the crosslinking process. \n\nA detailed study regarding morphology, ion conductivity and water uptake with controllable hydrophobic block composition in AEMs was conducted. In this work I described how the properties of block copolymer anion exchange membranes (AEMs) vary with the hydrophobic block composition and ion content. Under the similar ion content (IEC = ~ 2.0 meq g-1), the block copolymers with methacrylate and styrenic hydrophobic blocks showed similar ionic conductivity. The water uptake of the materials slightly increased when the ion content of the samples was above 2.0 meq g-1 below which the hydration number almost remained constant (~7 water molecules per ionic moiety).The stearyl methacrylate containing sample was mechanically robust in liquid water due to the introduction of semicrystalline blocks. In particular, the factors conducive to the conductivity will be discussed in detail. The ionic polymers with long-range ordered microstrtures and high ion content (IEC = ~ 3.0 meq g-1) had the highest conductivity.\n\nSulfonimide-containing random copolymers based on poly(arylene ether sulfone) (PAES), poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) and poly(styrene) (PS) were synthesized by low cost post-polymerization modification under mild conditions. These synthetic routes provided universal scale-up approaches for industry production due to the absence of expensive monomers purification. The Radel samples in sulfonimide or sulfonic acid form displayed higher proton conductivity than PPO analogues. These sulfonimide copolymers showed proton conductivity comparable to sulfonic analogs but lower water uptake. The thermal stability of sulfonimide copolymers was stable up to 250 \u00b0C under nitrogen atmosphere. The sulfonimide samples are applicable to high temperature PEMs due to its higher ionic moieties degradation temperature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9200], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Lizhu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lizhu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Ralph H Colby", "Tze Chiang Chung", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Tze Chiang Chung, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["block copolymer anion exchange membranes"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "the auxiliary space solvers and their applications", "id": "23592", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10495", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Developing efficient iterative methods and parallel algorithms for solving sparse linear sys- tems discretized from partial differential equations (PDEs) is still a challenging task in scien- tific computing and practical applications. Although many mathematically optimal solvers, such as the multigrid methods, have been analyzed and developed, the unfortunate reality is that these solvers have not been used much in practical applications. In order to narrow the gap between theory and practice, we develop, formulate, and analyze mathematically optimal solvers that are robust and easy to use in practice based on the methodology of Fast Auxiliary Space Preconditioning (FASP).\nWe develop a multigrid method on unstructured shape-regular grids by the construction of an auxiliary coarse grid hierarchy on which the multigrid method can be applied by using the FASP technique. Such a construction is realized by a cluster tree which can be obtained in O(N log N ) operations for a grid of N nodes. This tree structure is used for the definition of the grid hierarchy from coarse to fine. For the constructed grid hierarchy, we prove that the condition number of the preconditioned system for an elliptic PDE is O(logN). Then, we present a new colored block Gauss-Seidel method for general unstructured grids. By constructing the auxiliary grid, we can aggregate the degree of freedoms in the same cells of the auxiliary girds into one block. By developing and a parallel coloring algorithm for the tree structure, a colored block Gauss-Seidel method can be applied with the aggregates serving as non-overlapping blocks. On the other hand, we also develop a new parallel unsmoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid method for the PDEs defined on an unstructured mesh from the auxiliary grid. It provides (nearly) optimal load balance and predictable communication patterns factors that make our new algorithm suitable for parallel computing.\nFurthermore, we extend the FASP techniques to saddle point and indefinite problems. Two auxiliary space preconditioners are presented. An abstract framework of the symmetric positive definite auxiliary preconditioner is presented so that the optimal multigrid method could be applied for the indefinite problem on the unstructured grid. We also numerically verify the optimality of the two preconditioners for the Stokes equations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10145], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Lu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jinchao Xu", "James Joseph Brannick", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Chao Yang Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jinchao Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "James Joseph Brannick, Committee Member", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Chao Yang Wang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multigrid", "auxiliary space", "solver"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Joint Modeling of Recurrent Events and Other Failure Time Events", "id": "xd07gs69t", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12772", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recurrent events are commonly encountered in biomedical research studies and clinical trials. Many previous studies are done to investigate recurrent event analysis. As introduced in Chapter 1, some of the early work on recurrent event focuses on survival outcomes and others on longitudinal outcomes. If recurrent events are\ncorrelated with a failure event, such as death, we no longer should assume independent censoring. Many reports in the literature incorporate a latent variable model to account for the correlation between the time to event T and the number of recurrent events N(t).\nWe fi\frst jointly model the time to primary outcome and the number of recurrent events with the frailty model, using a Zero-inflated-Poisson-Weibull distribution. We develop the analytical forms and details in the full parametric setting; however, such a model may be over-parameterized and di\u000ecult to apply, which limits\nus from applying full likelihood-based analyses.\nBecause of the limitation of the frailty model, we propose a joint distribution for (T;N) based on conditional distributions. We illustrate the use of this joint distribution to model the recurrent events of acute kidney injury (AKI) and time to primary outcome (death) in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) and AKI. In this fully parametric model, we develop the intensity ratio for the recurrent events and the hazard ratios for the failure event among different groups of patients with or without an AKI event at the index hospitalization and with or without CKD at the index hospitalization. Based on our model, we then investigate if recurrent AKI is predictive of death.\nFurther, we are interested in a non-terminal event, such as End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), which may be censored by a terminal event (Death), but not vice versa. The previous methods, such as a cause-speci\fc hazards model and a subdistribution hazards model are based on the independence assumption, which\nis not appropriate in such case.

There are also observations indicating that breast, ovarian, and gastric tumors with higher levels of HtrA1 expression have a greater response to chemotherapies compared with those with lower HtrA1 levels. However, the precise mechanism(s) leading to the down regulation of HtrA1 during malignant transformation are unclear, and the putative tumor suppressor functions of HtrA1 in human cancers are poorly understood. \nRecently, emerging data suggest that epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) play critical roles in the regulation of resistance to chemotherapeutics. Acquisition of mesenchymal-like properties indicate a switch of cancer cells from proliferation to an invasive phenotype, which could facilitate escape from effects of drugs that target cell growth pathways, eventually leading to therapeutic resistance.\nTherefore, we hypothesized that HtrA1 gene expression would be decreased in breast epithelial cancer cells/tissues, compared with their normal counterparts, and this down-regulation of HtrA1 might contribute to the drug resistance in cancer cells at least in part through induction of the EMT.\nThe overall goal of this thesis project was to test this hypothesis by: 1) characterizing HtrA1 gene expression in both normal and cancerous human breast epithelial cells; 2) investigating potential functional mechanisms of HtrA1 in breast carcinogenesis in breast epithelial cells.\nWe characterized HtrA1 expression in seven human breast epithelial cell lines. Two of them were immortalized, non-tumorigenic \u201cnormal\u201d breast epithelial cell lines whereas five were breast cancer cell lines. We found that HtrA1 expression was dramatically decreased in human breast cancer cell lines compared with their \u201cnormal\u201d counterparts. The decreased HtrA1 expression was largely attributable to transcriptional defects, which involve epigenetic silencing mechanisms. A dramatically decreased expression of HtrA1 was also observed in human ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions compared with \u201cnormal\u201d breast epithelium. To further study the HtrA1 gene functions in breast epithelial cells, we modified the \u201cnormal\u201d MCF10A cell line. We created 4 stably transfected cell lines expressing 4 siRNAs targeted to HtrA1 (HtrA1 knockdown cells), as well as a stably transfected cell line overexpressing HtrA1. We found that the HtrA1 knockdown cells underwent the EMT, acquiring a mesenchymal phenotype, encompassing increased growth rate, increased migration and invasion ability, expression of mesemchymal cell biomarkers, and decreased expression of epithelial cell biomarkers as well as decreased expression of microRNA 200 family members. Further, reduction of HtrA1 expression activated ATM and resulted in formation of &#947;H2AX foci following acute oxidative stress, whereas overexpression of HtrA1 prevented formation of the foci. \nCollectively, these results suggest that HtrA1 may function as an important tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. The association of HtrA1 expression levels with resistance to chemotherapeutics might relate to the EMT, as well as to important effects of HtrA1 in DNA damage response components. From this point of view, HtrA1 may serve as a new biomarker in breast cancer diagnosis and a therapeutic target and outcome predictor.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4715], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Ning ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Alan Clawson", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Judith Weisz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Alan Clawson, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Chair", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Member", "Judith Weisz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HtrA1", "breast cancer", "epigenetic modifications", "EMT", "DNA damage response"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Functional study of S-locus F-box genes in S-RNase-based self-incompatibility of Petunia inflata", "id": "16018", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7999", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Self-incompatibility (SI) is a genetic barrier that allows pistils of flowering plants to distinguish between self (genetically related) and non-self (genetically unrelated) pollen to prevent inbreeding and promote out-crossing.

Variants of the S-locus are referred to as \u201cS-haplotypes\u201d, and designated S1, S2, S3, etc. Pollen carrying an S-haplotype identical to either haplotype of the pistil is recognized as self-pollen, and growth of their tubes in the pistil is inhibited. Pollen carrying an S-haplotype different from both S-haplotypes of the pistil is recognized as non-self pollen and accepted. The S-RNase gene, which controls pistil specificity, was identified first. Subsequent sequencing of the S-locus region containing S-RNase led to the identification of the Petunia inflata S-locus F-box (PiSLF) gene. PiSLF2, the S2-allele of PiSLF, was shown to control pollen specificity from a transgenic approach, based on the phenomenon of competitive interaction. My dissertation research focuses on the PiSLF gene, with the overall goal of understanding how its allelic products interact with different S-RNases to result in specific rejection of self-pollen.\nIn Chapter 2, two additional alleles of PiSLF, PiSLF1 and PiSLF3, were examined using the same transgenic approach that established the function of PiSLF2. Unlike the previous results obtained for PiSLF2, neither PiSLF1 nor PiSLF3 behaved as predicted by competitive interaction. The results raised the possibility that PiSLF, previously thought to be solely responsible for pollen specificity, might not be the only gene involved.\nThe S-locus contains additional pollen-expressed F-box genes that show sequence similarity with PiSLF. These genes were initially named PiSLF-like genes, as they were thought not to be involved in pollen specificity. In view of the possibility that additional genes are involved, I used the same transgenic approach to re-examine the function of two PiSLF-like genes, PiSLFLb-S2 and PiSLFLd-S2, along with PiSLF1, PiSLF2 and PiSLF3, in six different S-haplotype backgrounds that had not been previously tested. The results, described in Chapter 3, showed that PiSLFLb is also involved in controlling pollen specificity. Professor Takayama\u2019s lab in Japan also found that two SLF-like genes in P. hybrida are involved. Based on these findings, the two labs jointly proposed a model, collaborative non-self recognition, to explain the biochemical basis of SI. A new nomenclature system was introduced to classify the known PiSLF and PiSLF-like genes into ten types (Type-1 to Type-10). The first identified PiSLF gene was classified as Type-1 SLF (e.g., PiSLF2 is now named S2-SLF1, for SLF1 of S2-haplotype) and PiSLF-like genes are named Type-2, Type-3, etc. According to this model, a yet unknown number of different types of PiSLF genes collaboratively control pollen specificity.\nChapter 4 describes the study of the role of three functional domains (FDs), FD1, FD2 and FD3, of PiSLF in its allele/type specificity. These three FDs were assigned based on sequence alignment and in vitro protein binding assays. I constructed two chimeric genes between PiSLF2 and PiSLFLb-S2, and five chimeric genes between PiSLF2 and PiSLF3 by domain swapping. PiSLF2, but not PiSLFLb-S2 or PiSLF3, interacts with S3-RNase. Analysis of the SI behavior of the transgenic plants expressing each of these chimeric genes revealed that FD2 is necessary but not sufficient for the ability of PiSLF2 to interact with S3-RNase, and that FD3 of PiSLF2 is required for PiSLF2 to interact with S3-RNase.\nIn Chapter 5, I summarize the major findings of my dissertation research; chief among them is my contribution to the discovery that multiple SLF genes are involved in pollen specificity, which has raised many interesting questions about the evolution and operation of S-RNase-based SI. I discuss several approaches that could be used to address some of the questions in order to gain a deeper understanding of this sophisticated self/non-self recognition mechanism.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7947], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Ning ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao", "Teh Hui Kao", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao, Dissertation Advisor", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Chair", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-incompatibility", "Petunia inflata", "Solanaceae"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Block Mixture Model To Map Eqtls For Gene Clustering", "id": "26198", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11556", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To study how genes function in a cellular and physiological process, a general procedure is to classify gene expression profiles into categories based on their similarity and reconstruct a regulatory network for functional elements.

Here we address this issue by developing a block mixture based approach that integrates gene clustering and reconstruction with genetic mapping into a unifying framework. The approach can not only identify specific eQTLs that control how genes are clustered and organized toward biological functions, but also enable the investigation of the biological mechanisms how eQTLs perturb in a signaling pathway. We applied the approach to characterize the effects of eQTLs on the structure and organization of gene clusters, and extended it aiming at specific characteristics of different eQTL studies. These studies provide the first characterization, to our knowledge, of the effects of genetic variants on the regulatory network of gene expression.

The goal of this study was to employ a continuous grip-force based GNG task to capture subtle but important behavioral differences in motor inhibition. To that end, we employed a traditional button-press GNG task and a grip force variant of the task with identical parameters to examine inhibitory control in adults aged 18 \u2013 25 (N = 171, 84 female) with and without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Results suggest that adults with ADHD generated greater peak force and increased trial-by-trial variability of force in No-Go trials of the force task than adults without ADHD. Continuous force outputs were dichotomized to create CE rates. Regardless of group, the force task detected more CEs compared to the button-press task (ps < .001).

Taking the related reference and case studies into account, this empirical study proposes two conceptual frameworks and then establishes measurement scales. It gathers data for analysis by means of questionnaires used to interview respondents.

However, the detailed mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this study, we used pericarp color1 (p1) as a genetic and phenotypic marker to study the nature of epigenetic regulation in maize. The p1 gene encodes an R2R3 Myb transcription factor and regulates biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments in the flavonoid pathway. Expression of the p1 gene commonly yields red pigmentation in pericarps and cob glumes, leading to diverse pigmentation patterns. More than 100 alleles of p1and their conspicuous pigmentation patterns have been reported. For instance, P1-wr confers white pericarp and red cob glume, whereas P1-rr confers red pericarp and red cob glume phenotypes. We have previously determined that P1-wr allelic pattern is epigenetically regulated. To elucidate the detailed mechanism(s) responsible for the tissue-specific silencing of P1-wr through epigenetics, reverse genetics approaches were used to isolate mutations that disrupt p1 silencing. We have thus characterized Unstable factor for orange1 (Ufo1), a trans-acting dominant epigenetic modifier. The Ufo1-1 mutation relieves P1-wr silencing and induces ectopic p1 expression in several organs including pericarp, leaf sheath, husk, and tassel glume. The increased p1 expression has been associated with reduction of DNA methylation at P1-wr. In addition to activating the pericarp expression of P1-wr allele, Ufo1-1 mutation also perturbs the pericarp and cob glume silencing of an ultra-silent P1-wr epiallele (P1-wr*). First exposure of P1-wr* to Ufo1-1 activated the p1 expression in cob glume and such activation was associated with the decrease of DNA methylation at the cob-specific regulatory element in intron 2 of the p1. In chapter 2, I demonstrated that suppression of p1 expression in pericarps is relieved subsequently after cob glume pigmentation is first restored, suggesting a sequential reactivation epigenetic mechanism. This mechanism may involve relaxation of chromatin structure because the sequential interaction of Ufo1-1 with the silent P1-wr* is associated with the reduction of H3K9me2. In addition to P1-wr*, the reduction of H3K9me2 was also observed in other Ufo1-1-induced reactivation of silent p1 alleles.\niv\nThese results suggest that wild-type ufo1 is involved in an epigenetic mechanism which is responsible for maintenance of suppressive histone marks at the silent alleles of p1.\nIn chapter 3, I compared ufo1 with another epigenetic modifier, Mediator for paramutation1 (Mop1), for their effects in the maintenance of transcriptional silencing. The Mop1 encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and is required for establishment and maintenance of paramutation at certain maize loci. It has been shown that mop1-1 mutation gradually reactivates the silencing of p1 alleles but in contrast to the prompt reactivation of silencing in Ufo1-1 background, more than one generation of exposure to mop1-1 mutation is required to disrupt the P1-rr\u2019 silencing. We found that mop1-1 mutation only slightly reduces DNA methylation at P1-wr and P1-rr\u2019, unlike the Ufo1-1 background, which dramatically reduces DNA methylation. However, mop1-1 reduces histone modification H3K9me2 by two fold, while Ufo1-1 causes a three-fold reduction of H3K9me2. These results are consistent with the results obtained from chapter 2 and suggest that histone modification has a core role in the maintenance of silencing, and DNA methylation alone may not be sufficient to maintain silencing. Additional loci will be tested for the Mop1-mediated pathway\u2019s role in reinforcing the silenced states that are maintained by the chromatin-based mechanism established via ufo1 pathway.\nWe have identified ufo1\u2019s involvement in DNA methylation and histone modification, and observed the pleiotropic phenotypic effects in plants carrying the Ufo1-1 mutation. This highlights the importance of the ufo1-mediated pathway for growth and development in maize. However, ufo1 has not been cloned and thus fine mapping approach was employed to locate the ufo1 on chromosome 10.03. I developed and used two mapping populations and screened for recombinants by SSR and CAPS molecular markers. The linkage map of the ufo1 locus will be further used for map-based cloning. Moreover, we have identified two putative SSR markers that are tightly linked to Ufo1-1 induced phenotypes. These markers may be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) to screen Ufo1-1 mutation and perform downstream molecular analysis.\nIn this thesis, we studied the role of ufo1 in histone modifications and the mechanisms underlying tissue-specific silencing and paramutation through the ufo1-\nv\nmediated pathway. It highlights that ufo1 is a key contributor in the maintenance of silencing and as compared with the Mop1, ufo1, may affect chromatin structure. Finally, the fine-mapping results and the linked molecular markers will expedite our goal to clone ufo1 gene.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7104], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Po-Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Po-Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra", "Surinder Chopra", "Dawn S Luthe", "Majid R Foolad", "Yinong Yang", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra, Dissertation Advisor", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Chair", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["maize", "genetics", "genetics", "fine mapping"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "REGULATION OF NEUROPEPTIDE Y EXPRESSION AND THE SYMPATHO-ADRENAL RESPONSE TO STRESS", "id": "12117", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5061", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid peptide that is synthesized by many neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. NPY has been implicated in many physiological functions including the regulation of feeding, anxiety, the stress response and cardiovascular modulation. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the NPY gene has been found to be associated with elevated serum cholesterol levels, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This SNP changes the seventh amino acid in the signal sequence of the NPY preprohormone (preproNPY) from leucine to proline. It is predicted to alter NPY synthesis, trafficking, or secretion. I tested this hypothesis by expressing the mutant and wild-type preprohormones tagged with fluorescent proteins in AtT-20 cells, an endocrine cell line. Prohormone from the mutant preproNPY was synthesized and processed normally and entered the regulated secretory pathway. When expressed in endocrine cells, NPY derived from both wild-type and mutant preproNPY were found in the same large dense core granules. However the SNP altered the degree of co-packaging and individual granules contained more NPY generated from the mutant preproNPY. I conclude that the SNP enhances the packaging of NPY. This SNP also led to an increase in the secretion of NPY, which is likely the consequential effect of the increased biosynthesis of the prohormone. These findings are consistent with the observation that humans carrying this SNP have higher levels of plasma NPY after exercise. \nPeripheral NPY is derived from the sympathetic nervous system, which includes the adrenal medulla. This tissue contains modified post-ganglionic neurons and is both part of the sympathetic system and an endocrine gland. Mammalian adrenal glands consist of two regions, the cortex and the medulla. Stress activates the HPA axis leading to a secretion of the glucocorticoids (CORT) from the adrenal cortex. The sympatho-adrenal system is also activated by stress leading to a release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla. NPY and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker of catecholamine synthesis) are co-expressed in all mouse chromaffin cells. Adrenal NPY transcription is known to be increased by various stressors and here I investigate whether NPY has a regulatory role on adrenal activity. To address this question, mice were exposed to an acute stressor the cold water forced swim test (cold FST) for 5-6 minutes. The cold FST elevated both the electrical activity of chromaffin cells and the HPA axis. Unexpectedly, activation of both limbs of the stress response was sustained even 24 hours after the cold FST. The level of adrenal NPY-ir was significantly increased 24 hours after the cold FST both in vitro and in situ, and this increase reversed one week later. The stress-induced increase in the levels of adrenal NPY involved an up-regulation in the activity of the NPY promoter. To determine whether NPY modulated adrenal activity, both wild type and NPY knockout mice were exposed to the cold FST. Loss of NPY did not affect the stress-induced increase in plasma Cort, but the removal of NPY significantly altered the neuronal branch of the stress response. That is, stress increased the levels of adrenal TH-ir in situ in the wild type mice but the level of adrenal TH-ir was not altered in the NPY knockout mice. Injection of BIBP 3226, a NPY Y1 antagonist was associated with an increase in the level of TH-ir in adrenal slices in wild type mice indicating that NPY negatively regulated adrenal TH via Y1 receptors. I conclude that acute stress has a long-term effect on the synthetic capacity of the adrenal glands and that NPY plays an important role in inhibiting the neuronal branch of the stress response.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5037], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Douglas Cavener", "Matthew Whim", "Bernhard Luscher", "Melissa Rolls", "Byron C Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Chair", "Matthew Whim, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neuropeptide Y", "catecholamines", "stress", "adrenal medulla"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Topics in U-statistics and Risk Estimation\n\n", "id": "11410", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5062", "abstract_tesi": "We consider estimating the variance of a general U-statistic when it is used as an unbiased estimator of the parameter of interest\ntheta=E(K) where K is the kernel function.

This area is quite old, with many important results first appearing in Hoeffding (1948). There have been many applications of U-statistics in nonparametric statistics. One area that is quite modern and active is cross-validation and risk estimation, although it has not traditionally been thought of as a U-statistic area. The application of my research has been focused on this area.\n\nThe first objective of my research is to devise the best unbiased variance estimator for a general U-statistic. It can be written as a quadratic form of the kernel function and is applicable as long as the kernel size k<=n/2. In addition, it can be represented as a familiar ANOVA form as a contrast of between-class and within-class variation. As a further step to make the proposed variance estimator more practical, we developed a partition resampling scheme that can be used to realize the U-statistic and its variance estimator simultaneously with high computational efficiency. \n\nWe then turn our attention to the implementation of U-statistics in risk estimation in the context of the nonparametric kernel density estimator. We propose to construct a U-statistic form estimate for the risk that arises from L2 and Kullback-Leibler distance respectively. In addition, we consider a two-stage, \"subsampling+extrapolation\", bandwidth selection procedure which can help to reduce the variability of the conventional cross-validation bandwidth selector dramatically. It is equivalent to Hall and Robinson's (2009) rescaled \"bagging cross-validation\" bandwidth selector if one sets the fictional sample size equal to the bootstrap size. However, the simple form for our U-statistic risk estimator enables us to calculate the aggregated risk much more efficiently than bootstrapping. Moreover, a real data example in the context of model selection is considered. We construct a U-statistic cross-validation tool, akin to the BIC criterion for model selection. The U-estimator for the likelihood risk is more generally applicable than the AIC and BIC methods. In addition, with our proposed variance estimator for a general U-statistic we can test which model has the smallest risk. Finally, we will explore extrapolation and interpolation techniques with applications in bandwidth selection, variance estimation, and quantile estimation.

Local grain boundary defect chemistry was quantitatively determined by analytical transmission electron microscopy. Electrical properties associated with both bulk and the grain boundaries were obtained using impedance spectroscopy. Experimental findings were compared to the high-temperature equilibrium thermodynamic space-charge models that incorporated both electrostatic and elastic driving forces for solute segregation. For yttrium, solute excess density at the grain boundaries was found to increase with the dopant concentration until the solid state solubility was reached. The activation energy for electrical conduction increased with dopant concentration, which implied a blocking barrier at the grain boundaries introduced by the solute interfacial excess. Local grain boundary defect chemistry, including core and space-charge layers, was employed to understand the relationship between the specific grain boundary resistivity and solute excess. The thermodynamic models showed that the elastic driving force was dominant in this system and electrostatic driving force only contributed a 10-20% correction to the total solute segregation. In comparison to the experimental results, the models provided good predictions for several grain boundary parameters including local stoichiometry, solute interfacial excess, barrier height and space charge layer thickness.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5036], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Qinglei ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qinglei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth C Dickey", "Clive A Randall", "Long Qing Chen", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["grain boundary segregation", "TiO2"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Evaluating Multiple Sequence Alignments Using ENCODE Data", "id": "18910", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9088", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a key aspect of decoding genomic sequences, comparative genomic research has become increasingly prominent during the last decade. A crucial prerequisite for comparative genomics is multiple genomic sequence alignments, especially whole-genome multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). Various downstream analyses rely implicitly on whole-genome MSAs. Unfortunately, whole-genome MSAs still suffer from inadequate reliability and the research on assessing their quality has not been fully addressed yet. Regardless of whether we seek better alignment methods or want to select the most reliable available MSAs, a practical evaluation method for MSAs is imperative. Therefore, we propose a new method, MSAME (MSA Motif-based Evaluation), to quantify the reliability of MSAs based on the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE project. Our method is one of the first MSA evaluation methods based on experimental data. Instead of using simulations relying on evolutionary models, we define a biological criterion inferred from different scenarios of motif shifting in ChIP-seq peak regions, and evaluate MSAs from such a functional perspective. Our method efficiently identifies two types of MSA errors, and it is robust to noises introduced by parameter changes. By applying our method to evaluate high coverage 11-way eutherian MultiZ and EPO alignments, we identify 7.9% and 6.7% of alignments in specific ChIP-seq bound regions as unreliable MSAs respectively. This allows us to identify putative evolutionary motif shifting as a by-product. Finally, we conduct further analysis for putative evolutionary motif shifting events that we detect for binding sites of the transcription factors GATA1, CTCF, and NRSF.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8914], "author_name_tesi": "Wang, Qingyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Wang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qingyu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Webb Colby Miller", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Webb Colby Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Thesis Advisor", "Naomi S Altman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiple Sequence Alignment", "Motif-based evaluation", "ENCODE", "ChIP-seq"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of whole exome sequencing technology in cohort dataset and quantification of phenotypic alterations in a model organism", "id": "28696", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12081", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation outlines bioinformatics approaches to improve genotypic and phenotypic analysis of disease variants.  The first study is focused on improving the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) technology. WES is a clinical diagnostic tool for discovering the genetic basis of many diseases, which takes advantage of the high coverage in target regions and provides a high probability of variant detection in protein coding regions. A major shortcoming of WES is the uneven coverage, which undermines its ability to detect deleterious mutations. Variant calling in specific low coverage regions is not accurate resulting in missing heritability. An examination of WES coverage by different capture technologies identified several parameters that affect coverage. The coverage could not be improved by increasing the number of sequencing runs. The low coverage regions had non-random distribution in the genome with a predominant clustered occurrence in regions enriched in duplicated sequences. These studies revealed that a significant number of reads were mistakenly discarded in WES datasets because of problems associated with mapping strategies. To improve the mapping results, a program, Rescuer, was developed. Rescuer first clusters overlapping reads mapped to multiple locations on the reference genome, and then assembles adjacent reads into longer contigs, which can be uniquely matched to target regions. Employing Rescuer, it was possible to achieve 10-20% improvement in the coverage. Rescuer significantly contributes towards variant detection in clinical investigations and accounts for some of the missing heritability issues in the study of complex diseases.\nA second study focused on improving methods for functional validation of disease associated variants in experimental studies using a model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila eye is used as a model to study basic developmental and cellular processes, genes and genetic interactions and human diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, cancer and more recently intellectual disability. Over 2500 genes are involved in the Drosophila melanogaster eye development.  These genes account for about two-thirds of the vital genes in the genome making the fly eye an excellent experimental system for genetic screening. However, current strategies for functional screening of genes using the fly eye have been limited by a lack of highly sensitive and quantitative assays. To address this problem, a quantitative tool for functional analysis of genes and genetic interactions in the experimental Drosophila eye system was developed. The algorithm, implemented as Flynotyper software, uses a series of image processing operations to automatically detect the fly eye and the individual ommatidium, and calculates a phenotypic score as a measure of the disorderliness of ommatidial arrangement in the fly eye. Flynotyper eliminates the need for qualitatively rank ordering the eye phenotypes and provides an accurate and automated method for eye phenotyping, documenting a broad range of impact for quantitative functional screens. The Rescuer and Flynotyper software packages developed in this study considerably improve detection of variants and provide quantitative assessments phenotypic variation in a model organism. These studies are likely to contribute to better assessment of the role of genetic variants in normal cellular processes and in disease conditions.
